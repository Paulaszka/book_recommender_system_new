The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took part in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strength of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. First one Player moves his units and conducts attacks, and then the other. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. This gives Players a chance to &quot;change history.&quot; No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box&#10;&#10;"

The other half is split into three different mini games all built around the same key phrases.  Two involve trying to guess the popular word or phrase by either charades/drawing or talking about the phrase but not using any of the words in the actual question.&#10;&#10;The last part involves pure chance where a random event migh help or hinder the current player slightly.  Winning the round in these various activities will earn cards with an individual letter which eventually spells out &quot;D-E-R-I-V-A-T-I-O-N.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first player to do this wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Provide your own dice.&#10;&#10;Set in the Caribbean in the 17th century, the game can be played on two levels and in two ways, making four different games in all.  You can play it simply as a two-player ship-to-ship combat game, using either basic or advanced combat rules.  The advanced rules use a system reminiscent of Ace of Aces to track your opponent's sailing ship (and the wind) relative to your ship.  The basic game is much simpler, just keeping track of your hull points, guns, sails, and boarders.  (Boarding rules are similar to Battle Chips from Tim's Games.)&#10;&#10;The campaign game can be played by four players - more if you photocopy player mats and don't mind people doubling up on roles.  With four, each person takes one of four roles: pirate, British privateer, merchant, Spanish galleoneer.  Each has different goals to win the game.  There is a simple map of the Caribbean with six ports (some British, some Spanish, some neutral, some cities, some towns, some villages) and two different sea zones.  You simultaneously select your destinations and reveal (you can't go directly from port to port - you must first go to one of the sea zones).  If you're in the same area as another player, there may be combat - use either basic or advanced ship-to-ship combat as described above.  Once that's resolved, roll on the encounter tables, modifying the result depending on if a port is hostile or friendly or neutral to you.  After resolving events and encounters on the tables, you may trade if in port.&#10;&#10;Goals involve varying quantities booty, supplies, medals and legends.  Booty and supplies you can get through trading, booty and legends can be gotten through fighting, and medals can be bribed out of local governors.&#10;&#10;"

In a matter of minutes, you'll learn the moves. The Jump. The Capture. And the Power Play. The rest is up to you. Make your moves courageously or cautiously. But always be on guard.

The game uses a unique system of movement for trucks, wartraks and bikes to locate riches and beat up rival mobs.

You can also trace a line across the board, which then gives you control of the smaller of the two parts thus created.

Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.&#10;&#10;To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.&#10;&#10;Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.&#10;&#10;The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.&#10;&#10;Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.&#10;&#10;And so it goes.&#10;&#10;This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.&#10;&#10;The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.&#10;&#10;"

April 6, 1862.  The Union Army of the Tennessee is beginning to stir beneath the shadow of a small frontier church in western Tennessee.  The troops of U.S. &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant wait only for their junction with Buell's Army of the Ohio to begin their long planned advance into the heartland of the Confederacy.&#10;&#10;Then suddenly the spring morning is shattered by the rattle of gunfire and the piercing rebel yell of over 40,000 charging Confederate soldiers.  The battle is joined and the fate of the west hangs in the balance.  Can you as General A. S. Johnston drive the Union invaders from Southern soil?

What? Curses? How can this be a party?! Ah, but these Curses are fun, not malicious, something along the lines of &quot;You can't bend your elbows&quot; or &quot;You must declare eternal love to anyone who rings the bell during this game&quot;.&#10;&#10;After that, each turn in Curses! the active player takes two actions in this order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw a Challenge card. This card presents you with an action you must perform &ndash; a role to act out, a story to tell, an opinion to explain.&#10;    Draw a Curse card and give it to another player. &quot;You, bark like a dog whenever the player on your right reads a card!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;So where's the game? You must obey the Curses placed upon you at all times &ndash; and if someone notices that you're not barking or declaring eternal love or doing whatever else it is you're supposed to be doing, then that player rings the central bell and reveals you for a louse and a nogoodnik. As a penalty, you must turn the Curse card you violated face down. And while you might think that lifting a Curse is good, break three Curses and you're out of the game. Eventually only one person will remain, and this Curse-loving looney wins the game!&#10;&#10;"
