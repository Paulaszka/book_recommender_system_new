One of the players leads the forces of the escaped gladiator Spartacus, the other controls the Roman forces. The game also includes rules for solitaire play (in which case the game system controls the Roman side).&#10;&#10;The game is played on a point-to-point map of Italy. Each point of the map has a set of numbers describing how many troops Spartacus can recruit there, how many equipment points are available (for arming and training recruits), how much food is available and if a granary is present in the region. Each game turn consists of moving Spartacus' army, collecting recruits, arming and training slaves, and checking whether or not there are enough supplies available in the occupied regions (if not, casualties occur and one or more regions is devastated). The Roman player then take her turn, moving legions and checking for reinforcements.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by a diceless Combat Result Table which take into account the training level and quality of the troops, the terrain and the strategic value of the leaders.&#10;&#10;Spartacus wins by either successfully besieging Rome, flee through the Alps or escape by the sea. The Roman player wins by preventing a Slave victory.&#10;&#10;"

Forty-two connection cards are laid face-up on the table (grouped as desired by the players), along with multipliers of value 2, 3 and 4.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can play cards from his hand to create any of the connections on a card. The player can simultaneously rearrange cards on the table to create new compounds, using the multiplier cards as needed to create molecules like O2 or H2O. If you leave element cards on the table, you must pick them up, but your hand limit is three cards; should you need to pick up more, those extra cards will count against you at the end of the game. A player's score is the sum of compound cards claimed and noble gas cards collected, minus penalties from dead cards collected during play.&#10;&#10;The second game is &quot;Chemuno&quot;, with all of the cards being shuffled together and each player receiving a hand of seven. The first player lays a card on the table; the next player must lay down a compound, element or multiplier that &quot;matches&quot; this first card. (A compound must use an identical element as a compound on the table or use the element or multiplier present, and so on.) If the previous card was a multiplier, the next player must draw 2-4 cards (equal to the mutiplier value) unless she can play the same multiplier herself, thereby doubling the penalty for the next player.

But who will be the most successful in avoiding the troglodytes and bigger monsters, while going for the fattest treasures, or even better, the legendary rings of power?&#10;&#10;The card deck in TSCHAK! is composed of twelve wizards (blue), twelve warriors (green), twelve dwarfs (red) and four artifacts (purple). Before the first round, a player receives three wizards, warriors and dwarfs and one artifact. (When playing with fewer than four players, deal out hands to virtual players; these are not used during the current round.) Set up the keep by placing one monster and one treasure tile face up on each of the three levels.&#10;&#10;Players now assault the keep, trying to avoid the monsters and claim treasure. On the first level, players choose one card from their hand, reveal it, choose another, reveal it, choose a third, and reveal it. A player must create a team of adventurers with three different colors, and the strengths of these teams (the sum of the cards' values) are then compared. (The chameleon wizard with a ? equals the strongest wizard on the table. The artifact doubles the weakest character on your team.) The weakest team gets the monster card, which costs points, and the strongest team gets the treasure card, usually positive points. Ties are broken in favor of the strongest wizard, then in favor of the wizard with the wand, then the strongest warrior, and so on.&#10;&#10;On the second level, players reveal one card, then a pair of cards, then compare strengths. On the third level, players reveal three cards at the same time. Players then compare the last card in hand, gaining 0-3 gold depending on the strength of that final card.&#10;&#10;Once all ten cards have been played, each player passes his whole hand to his left neighbour, a new dungeon is created, and you now play with the same cards as the player sitting to your right. After four rounds, the game ends and players tally their points. Some treasures and monsters are worth a set number of positive or negative points; others are worth the square of the number of them you've collected (whether positive or negative); additional treasures have special abilities, like eliminating one monster card from the tiles you've collected. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Good hand management, double-guessing, a tad of luck, and the victory is yours!&#10;&#10;"

Throughout the game, players simulate different actions of their divisions: charges and break through, artillery support and aerial bombings, organization off defenses and blocking enemy troops.&#10;&#10;All units in the game and all game events are shown as cards. Each card has an image of the unit, it's characteristics and abilities and also a text &ndash; usually it's a quotation from a historical novel or memoires, or some information on the current unit. All illustrations on the cards are done from actual black and white photos done during the war by using computer technologies.&#10;&#10;Booster packs containing new cards have been released for &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo;. Players can add any of these cards to their decks by purchasing the booster packs sold separately. This way, players can make their own unique decks by adding new cards to it. Depending on the cards in the deck victory may be easier than before. It's more important to have a balanced deck fit for different situations then just by adding strong cards. But both players need to have an equal amount of cards in their decks. It is also not recommended to have more than 60 cards in the deck.&#10;&#10;There is also a mmo game based on &ldquo;Victory Day&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The War Online&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Victory Day&rdquo; the board game is based mostly on &ldquo;The War&rdquo; CCG.

After that, the players take turns placing one of their own pieces on the board. When a square is on the board is completely enclosed by pieces, the player who has the majority (normally 3:1, but it can be 2:1 or 3:0 next to the edge or the neutral Moeraki-ball) claims the field and places a tribe marker on it.&#10;&#10;The game can be won in one of four ways:&#10;1. Tahuna (beach): A player wins if he has enclosed a field with four of his own pieces.&#10;2. Awa (river): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the intersections on one of the diagonal lines from one edge to another edge.&#10;3. Ara (road): A player wins if he has a piece on each of the four intersections on one edge.&#10;4. Marae (holy ground): When all the fields in the center have been claimed, players count the number of tribal markers they have got on the board (markers that are on the edge and that have been claimed with a 2:1 majority count only half). The player with the most markers wins the game.&#10;&#10;The players win several matches, until one of them has won the pre-determined amount of matches.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version of the game, both players receive a Maori-Tane (warrior).
