Two of them are roll and move while the other two require knowledge of the city history.&#10;Variant 1: The players alternate in rolling dice. If they can exactly move their pawn on a field featuring the same colour as the topmost of the cards they can gain it. Whoever has the most at the games end wins.&#10;Variant 2: A team game. Two players each play together. Unlike variant 1 it is only allowed to move one space. The rules for collecting are the same. One team wins if they have six of a colour.&#10;Variant 3: Like variant 2 but you only get the card if you can answer the question printed on the backside.&#10;Variant 4: Not really a competitive game. On the backside of the board are squares to hold each memory card. The cards are randomly shuffled into the squares and the players alternate in trying to put the right card into the right square until all cards are sorted.&#10;&#10;"

The same is true for hex pieces and round pieces.&#10;&#10;The playing board is triangular shaped with 3 types of sections: 3 Nests (where pieces start the game), 3 Pens (where captured pieces go) and the Ring (a center section where the action takes place).&#10;&#10;Pieces start the game in their nest and move directly to any empty space in the ring. They capture opponents&rsquo; pieces by moving straight-line to, and replacing, the captured piece in its space. The captured piece is sent to the Pen.&#10;&#10;When a piece moves into capture position on an opponent&rsquo;s piece, prior to capturing it, it can &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the opposing piece by flipping it over. The flipped piece is frozen (cannot move) for one turn.&#10;&#10;There a 3 types of normal moves: Nest-to-Ring (described above), swapping a piece from the Pen with a piece in the Ring and moving a piece inside the Ring.&#10;&#10;There is one special moved called a &ldquo;release&rdquo;, which can occur in a 3-player game if a player is getting &ldquo;ganged up on&rdquo; or it can be considered a handicap move for beginning players. It is made by moving a previously captured piece from the Pen back to its nest to return to play.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the last player to have at least one un-captured piece remaining, after all opponents&rsquo; pieces have been captured and placed in their Pen.&#10;&#10;The symmetry of the game board combines with a simple game-play routine, creating several layers of strategy with respect to piece positioning and piece selection.&#10;&#10;"

No figures are removed, so it is not critical how figures are based.  Suggested basing is 2 figures for infantry skirmishers and cavalry, and 4 figures (in two ranks) for non-skirmish infantry.  The typical units are 3 stands of cavalry (regiment) or a mixture of pike and shot stands for infantry (1 pike and 2 shot for a Swedish/Dutch regiment and up to 36 figures for a Tercio).  The scale is 1 figure = 50 men and 1&quot; = 50 yards.&#10;&#10;Significant features of the rules:&#10;&#10;- Each command group of units is given a standing order which it must follow.  Units continue to follow these orders until a new order is sent from the overall commander.  If the overall commander is too far away from the command, there will be delays in adopting the new order.&#10;&#10;- No figures are removed when damage occurs--units simply receive Disorder Markers (DM).  When ordinary units have accumulated 2 or more DM's (Tercios 4 or more DM), the unit becomes &quot;unformed&quot; and is unable to move at full speed and is less effective in fighting (e.g., unformed pikes are no longer at an advantage vs. cavalry).  Units automatically rally off disorder markers at a rate given by their morale and other attributes, and additional DM's can be rallied off if the unit remains stationary or has an attached commander.&#10;&#10;- Melees are resolved in multi-round battles until one side routs or is eliminated.  Losers of a round will accumulate Disorder Markers and be pushed back.  At some point, one side or other will rout and begin to retreat off the board.&#10;&#10;- Once a player loses a certain percentage of its units (depending on the army), units begin to retreat towards their board edge.&#10;&#10;No army lists are included, but scenarios are included which may give examples of typical units.

Each&#10;Fighter Card is not only used to keep track of which abilities a fighter has, it also tracks where in the&#10;Arena the fighter is and which moves the fighter is planning to perform in the upcoming turn. Each&#10;player has Ten health at the beginning of the game and two energy, each of which should be noted on&#10;the player's Fighter Card. The winner is the player that wins two out of three rounds. A round is won&#10;when the opponent is reduced to zero health.&#10;&#10;Part of the 4 Tile Contest:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408&#10;&#10;Freely available: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3175992#3175992&#10;http://drop.io/dpnp1c3&#10;&#10;"

The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game.
