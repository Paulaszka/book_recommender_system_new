This is a table-top implementation of Jellyvision's (now known as Jackbox Games) irreverent CD-ROM/online trivia game.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hosted&quot; by wisecracking &quot;Nate Shapiro&quot; (game creator Harry Gottlieb), the game serves as a scorekeeper of dollar values won or lost answering sublimely-worded trivia questions. The game's hard-coded database tracks questions by code, dollar value, and correct answer. A question's code is entered, the question is read aloud by a player, and a sliding door reveals four multiple-choice answers. Players race to buzz in, either to answer or to &quot;screw&quot; an opponent by forcing the opponent to answer. The game reveals whether or not players answer correctly and adjusts scores accordingly. High score after ten questions wins.&#10;&#10;Includes 125 question cards with 500 total general knowledge questions. At least two expansions were released--a TV Pack and a Movies Pack--each adding 113 cards with 450 (TV) or 452 (Movies) additional questions in the set's given subject. (More expansion sets may have been planned, but were not released.)&#10;&#10;"

(The board could easily be drawn with hexagons instead of circles and lines.)  The game is meant for three players but can be played by two.  Its pieces (ten per player) begin in one corner and move to an opponent's starting corner to be crowned, then must move to one of three central circles in order to win the game.  The first player to get one king to the central circles wins.  Pieces, be they ordinary un-promoted pieces or Kings, may move in any direction and capture opposing pieces by jumping.  Kings have no advantage other than that they are required to win the game.&#10;&#10;According to The International Society for Board Game Studies, Shan Tu dates back at least to an 1895 advertisement describing it as &quot;A worthy successor to Gobang, Reversi, Halma and other favourites.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&#10;    Thunderstone: Dragonspire&#10;    Thunderstone: Starter Set&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background.  By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics.  The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation's government and decides what the nation will do.  As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.  As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return.  Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!&#10;&#10;Imperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games. Compared to &quot;Imperial&quot; there will be some new features:&#10;- new wooden bits&#10;- the Swiss Bank &#10;- a new 30 million bond to invest in&#10;- more neutral territory, generating higher taxation&#10;- fewer home provinces&#10;- control of canals (Panama and Suez).&#10;&#10;For those who already owned Imperial, there was the opportunity to get only the new map and bonds at Essen '09, as it can be played with the old wooden bits as well.&#10;&#10;"
