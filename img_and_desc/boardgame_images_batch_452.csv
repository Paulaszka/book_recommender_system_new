It is a two-player tactical/operational simulation of the combat action on the American Sector during the first two days of the Normandy invasion, 6-7 June 1944.  The game looks at the American efforts all along the right flank of the Normandy landings. While Utah seemed relatively easy, it was there, at Omaha Beach, where the Germans came closest to derailing the greatest sea-borne invasion of all time. Behind both beaches, two famous airborne divisions were scattered all over the countryside, and fought by twos and twenties to accomplish a semblance of their missions. Call it the &ldquo;Longest Two Days,&rdquo; because that is the time-period covered in the game. Forty-eight hours of some of the most critical action in American history.&#10;&#10;The key units are all here, including engineers with special abilities, DD-tanks,  parachute and glider landings, and even railroad coastal artillery. One defining feature of the game is unit deployment; a unit can be deployed in one of two modes: Movement Mode allows for the greatest movement but the weakest combat (which is not to say those units can&rsquo;t fight) and Combat Mode, which allows the strongest fighting abilities (but still some movement for most units).&#10;&#10;&quot;Bradley&rsquo;s D-Day&quot; offers an intriguing scale, a moderate level of complexity, and an ease of play that will make this game either a fine addition to your Overlord collection, or a good first start for those who have not already focused on this campaign.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 2 hours of daylight or 4 hours or nightime&#10;Hex 800 meters&#10;Units: Company/Battalion&#10;&#10;Game Equipment&#10;One 22&quot; x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Two counter sheets (320 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 20 page rule book&#10;One Terrain Effects Chart&#10;No dice (game owners need to supply two six-sided die)&#10;&#10;"

Four blue and three green scoring spaces are scattered on the track, and four summit spaces are found at the end of the track. Each player is dealt a hand of six cards, with cards coming in ten colors to match those of the dragons; each player also starts with a uniquely-colored card face-up on the table to indicate which dragon the player is riding.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player lays down one card from his hand, then advances the appropriately-colored dragon as many spaces as the number shown on the card. If another player has a card of this color in front of her, the player places the card on that player's stack; if not, the player places the card on his own stack, effectively changing steeds if the color differs from what was on top previously. (Exception: If a dragon not being ridden by anyone is in last place, the player may choose to place the card under his stack instead of on top of it, while moving the dragon normally.)&#10;&#10;If a dragon moves onto a blue space, then each dragon on a space valued three or less scores that many points for the player riding that dragon, if any. If a dragon moves onto a green space, then each player scores points equal to the value of the space on which his dragon stands. If a player causes no scoring on his turn or plays his last card in hand, he refills his hand to six cards; if he caused a scoring, then he draws no card and plays with a smaller hand next turn.&#10;&#10;When a dragon moves onto one of the four summit spaces, all dragons score points (possibly negative) for their riders. Once three dragons have reached the summit, the game ends after a final scoring, and whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

So even if you don&rsquo;t know many Hawaiian words, you probably know a lot of names of people, streets, cities, and other places.&#10;     Two-letter huaolelo are okay.&#10;     You can use the same word twice.&#10;     Going over the pronunciation and definitions at the end is one of the funnest parts of the game. See how many new huaolelo you can learn from the other players.&#10;     Instructions are included inside the box.&#10;&#10;&#10;You'll find a few pieces that aren't letters.&#10;&#10;Watch out for the Ewalu piece! If someone draws it and plays it on you, aue! Aloha no! That means your crossword has to have at least one eight-letter huaolelo. Laki maikai!&#10;&#10;Need some different letters to spell a huaolelo? If you draw an Akau piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the akau, right.&#10;&#10;If you draw a Hema piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the hema, left.&#10;&#10;The Ku! piece is like a wildcard, so you can use it as any letter of your choosing. Or, if someone is winning and you want to stop their momentum, yell out &quot;Ku!&quot; to stop gameplay. You can then take one of their letters, replace it with the Ku! piece, and designate the Ku! piece as a different letter. Ho ke kolohe! What this means for your opponent is probably a lot of crossword rearranging! Minamina no hoi!&#10;&#10;The Ea piece is the one everybody wants to have. It means you have ea, or sovereignty, so nobody can mess with your crossword. In other words, you're free to make your own huaolelo without being affected by special pieces like Ewalu, Akau, Hema, and Ku. You are kuokoa--independent!&quot;&#10;&#10;"

If it lands on your color or the color of any other ninja in that space, you defeat the guard and take a normal turn; otherwise, move the general down one step and lose your turn.&#10;&#10;If the general reaches the bottom of the steps, he steal one weapon from you, then climbs to the top of the steps once again to begin another descent. If you have claimed no weapons by the time this happens, you all lose the game.&#10;&#10;Once all the weapons are claimed or captured by the general, enter the final battle, taking turns with the spinner to see whether the general captures another weapon, whether the ninja do, or whether nothing happens. Your sensei awaits on the side of the board, ready to aide you once during this final battle to protect the weapons &ndash; unless you've already used his power during the game.&#10;&#10;As with all the LEGO games, Ninjago: The Board Game includes multiple variants, such as adjusting the power of the sensei, adding a memory component, adding or removing steps in the temple to tweak the general's effect.&#10;&#10;"

I am looking for feedback and play-testing in order to strengthen the game, reduce/simplify the rules, and make the game fun.&#10;&#10;"

These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.&#10;&#10;Is your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights? Highlights are the randomly determined matchups over which players compete. The more highlights a team wins, the more it improves and the more fans it accumulates.&#10;&#10;The season culminates with the Blood Bowl tournament. After the Blood Bowl, the season ends. Players then tally up their total fans and the manager with the most fans wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

All other players then simultaneously try to answer the question by secretly placing one of their four answers cards (A,B,C or D) face down on the table. Each player with the correct answer then progresses his meeple on a linear track, according to the predetermined difficulty rating of the question.&#10;&#10;The questions are divided into the categories Science, History, Sport, Culture, People and Local. Some are simple and some are very tricky. For example, one can score if one knows that the local museum houses the original death mask of William Shakespeare, that the 1990 world-championship in solar racing was won by students of the city's university, that &quot;Kn&auml;&auml;rze&quot; is local slang for the end piece of a bread, or the country were the 2009 world championship in amateur boxing had been won by a local boxer.&#10;&#10;The game is of standard quality for a German boardgame with 6 classical wooden meeples and a full-color thick cardboard board.

The plague of brain-chomping quasi-dead, previously discounted and denied, have &#10;become a genuine menace in several major cities. Every government has its own notions of how to deal with it, major corporations seek to &#10;manipulate the crisis, military leaders push against the limits of civilian control, and the zombies simply&hellip;hunger.&#10;&#10;&#10;Zombie War is a 2-4 player game that takes the zombie threat to a global level. Each player has two hidden victory conditions and has to reach them using a rotating selection of roles, each with different powers and ways to gain victory points. In one turn you might be playing as the zombies, the next the government, the next the military, and finally the corporations. Yet, your victory conditions--for example, to infect three major capitals, or protect trade centers-- remain the same. The decisions you make as one role affect the other players, but may also affect you when you take on a different role in the next round. It is multiplayer mayhem on a strategic level.&#10;&#10; &#10;Zombie War takes about 60-90 minutes to play, is recommended for two to four players ages 14 and up, and includes:&#10; &#10;        1 x 22&quot; x 17&quot; richly-colored map of the world.&#10;        70 die-cut counters representing hordes of zombies, the medical personnel assigned to contain them, and the soldiers assigned to kill them.&#10;        18 victory condition, faction, and player aid cards.&#10;        Full-color rule book.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;"
