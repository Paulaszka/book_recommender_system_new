After centuries of abuse from mankind, the dying spirit of Earth has called out to the dragons with hopes they&rsquo;d help better humanity and reshape the world in elemental harmony. However, the destruction and violence that gave rise to their birth also tainted the dragons, driving them mad with a lust for war. Now the dragons not only battle humanity, but themselves. Ruthlessly hunting for the dragon eggs to satiate their endless hunger for power, the dragons wage an eternal struggle for dominance and the very soul of Earth.&#10;&#10;In DragonClash, you are the dragon, hatching your beast from a variety of decks geared towards a specific breed and play style. The core set of DragonClash includes the Red Breather, Blue Adept, Silver Channeler, and Brown Mauler decks. Each deck of 72-cards includes a dragon and a variety of attacks unique to that deck&rsquo;s theme.&#10;&#10;To claim victory, your dragon must win the opponent&rsquo;s Dragon Egg Card. You can do this by either forcing your opponent to discard his Dragon Egg or by consuming your opponent&rsquo;s hoard with a Feast card, while a Dragon Egg is hidden there. Players take turns feeding their dragon&rsquo;s hoard, aging from hatchling to elder wyrm, training a variety of attacks, and engaging in combat. Executing attacks, playing effects, and taking damage depletes your dragon&rsquo;s Essence (the playing deck) and when a player&rsquo;s dragon has exhausted all of their Essence, they must flee and lose the game.&#10;&#10;"

Can you return him to his natural state by collecting kisses and the golden ball, and placing him on the right lily pad?&#10;&#10;How it is played:&#10;&#10;The central piece of the game is a clear plastic cylinder that has a disk inside. The disk shows the prince on one side, and a frog on the other. It is turned over via a magnetic mechanism: If the cylinder is put on the castle tile, it shows the frog. If it is put on the correct lily pad, the tile is turned over again and the prince reappears.&#10;&#10;Players take turn spinning a spinner. The spinner has three different areas: One shows one &quot;kiss&quot; symbol (a pair of lips), the second shows two kisses, and the third one the golden ball. If the spinner points toward one of the kiss symbols, the active player gets the corresponding number of kiss tokens. If it points toward the golden ball, the active player gets the ball token (there is only one ball token, and it constantly changes its owner according to the spinner's results). A player can try rescuing the prince as soon as he/she has collected 3 kisses and the golden ball. To rescue the prince, the cylinder has to be put on the correct lily pad. But only one of the lily pads will make the prince reappear. If the player chooses the wrong lily pad, he/she loses their kiss tokens and has to start collecting new ones. If it is correct and the frog turns into a prince, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The player with the highest black card wins.  Everyone else (except for those who dropped out) then pay the winning player a number of coins equal to the value of the red card (aces are worth 1 coin, and face cards are worth 10 coins).

To win, the Japanese player has to sink the United State's aircraft carriers and thus capturing Midway Island. The American player wins by preventing the Japanese taking the island and inflicting more losses on the Japanese forces than his own suffer.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own board and the game thus uses a blind/search system. Only when the enemy is found can combat occur. Each turn represents 8 hours, so three turns per day are the limit. The searching rule owes a debt to dear old Battleships and the board is overlaid with squares so that movement is by square to square.&#10;&#10;Once combat starts, results are determined by a die roll. I think there could be very quick combat rounds &quot;Roll a 6 and the enemy carrier is sunk&quot;, that sort of thing (it is intended for beginners after all). When it comes to invading the island, the Japanese player gets only one attempt per game so the player must be pretty sure he has timed it correctly.&#10;&#10;There are variants - a quick game and an advanced game, plus rules for designating your aircraft as fighters and/or bombers.&#10;&#10;"
