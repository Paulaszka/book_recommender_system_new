Its profits catapulted the British Empire to global dominance and shaped the fate of some of the world's great nations, but its ascent was anything but easy. The Company was filled with diverging interests and struggled constantly at home and abroad.&#10;&#10;John Company attempts to tell the story of the British East India Company from the inside out. Players will steer their dynasties through the company's history, vying for position, power, and prestige. The goal of the game is simple: Use the Company and the Company's trade to secure your place in society back home. To this end, you guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region's infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home...&#10;&#10;As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It's even possible that the Company's trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms. Each game offers a huge range of possibilities, informed chiefly by the decisions the players make. In addition, players can tailor their experience by using one of the three tournament scenarios that cover the Early, Mid, and Late Company that can be played in about 90 minutes. The game also offers a full campaign game that will take players from 1720 to 1857 in an evening.&#10;&#10;Taking its inspiration from Phil Eklund's seminal Lords games, John Company offers Greed Incorporated by way of Republic of Rome &mdash; and with only sixty cards and multiple scenarios, John Company is one of the most accessible SMG offerings to date.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

At the beginning of each turn, the American player will roll to see if a Chance card is drawn. Chance cards introduce historical events into the game and their effects on one or both sides. The rule book has detailed historical descriptions of each event, which are informational only, but help to bring the history and drama of the Siege of Fort Stanwix to life. Following a possible Chance card draw, players will secretly assign forces and leaders to each of the four sides of Fort Stanwix: north, south, east, and west. How the players choose to distribute their forces will determine the outcome of the siege. Players then reveal their cards. If the British have assigned forces to assault one or more sides of the fort, players will compare the strengths of the opposing forces on that side and roll a die to determine the resultant casualties and whether a breach of the fortress walls has occurred. If the British achieve two breaches on the same turn, they have taken the fort and win the game. If, after 13 turns, the British fail to take the fort, the outnumbered Americans have broken the siege and have defeated the British.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the British may also elect to dig entrenchments to protect their artillery, or bombard or skirmish with sides of the fort to effect American morale.&#10;&#10;Easily playable in under an hour, &quot;To The Last Extremity&quot; is a simple wargame that provides a great deal of historical flavor surrounding one of the earliest American victories achieved in U.S. history.&#10;&#10;"
