Romanos Diogenes has assumed the imperial throne of the Eastern Roman Empire. Ferocious armies of Seljuk Turks are on the doorstep, ravaging the border cities of the East and sending yearly raids and campaigns into Roman lands. Beset by political intrigue in Constantinople and assuming command of a fragile military, Romanos has only a short time to assemble the largest Roman army in over a century to drive off the forces of the Sultan Alp Arslan before the Empire collapses. &#10;&#10;&#10;Seljuk&mdash;Volume VI in Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s Levy &amp; Campaign series&mdash;brings players into the challenges of medieval logistics and maneuver across Asia Minor during the clash between Orthodox Christian and Muslim power in the lead-up to the climactic Battle of Manzikert. Players will assume the role of either the Eastern Romans or Seljuk Turks as they seek to make their mark on this historic land. Asymmetric victory objectives and new and unique additions to the Levy &amp; Campaign system mean a dynamic game of cat and mouse between these two great powers.&#10;&#10;The Seljuks are on the offensive with vast numbers of Turkic horse, speedy mounted units adept at ranged combat with composite bows. A loose alliance of local vassal states loyal to the Sultan&rsquo;s cause and steppe tribes from central Asia unite under one banner to ravage the Roman state and carry off bounties of loot back to their homelands. The Romans field a much more heavily armored contingent of infantry and mounted Tagmata, but their frontier garrisons, the Themata, are few and not easily replaced. The Romans will have to use these stationary units judiciously to either defend against Seljuk ravaging or protect the walled towns and cities of the Empire from Turkic siege.&#10;&#10;And both sides have to confront the very real possibility that some of their allied Lords might switch sides&hellip; Can one final, epic clash make the Seljuks think twice about conquering Anatolia, or can the Muslim armies of the East win one of their greatest victories and capture the Emperor of the Romans on the field of battle?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Sitting squarely astride ancient trade routes and with the added impetus of the world's addiction to oil, the area has been a hot spot for centuries. Now, with the old regime teetering and losing its grip, Iran makes a bid for forcing the West to recognize its complete sovereignty and control over its own affairs by striking at the one thing they care about: the flow of oil. Mining the Straits of Hormuz and declaring it closed to all traffic, Iran defies the world. The US, and perhaps some of its allies, takes action to re-open the straits and get the black gold flowing to the world again.&#10;&#10;Next War: Iran is the sixth game in the Next War series. It is unique in the series in that the Allied player has to do the attacking while the non-Allied player attempts to defend its territory against neo-imperial oppression. With a long logistical tail, few true allies in the region, and the menace of Iran's A2AD capabilities, re-opening the Straits is a tall order.&#10; &mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.&#10;&#10;In the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.&#10;&#10;As with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space &mdash; which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.&#10;&#10;Nusfjord Big Box contains the Nusfjord base game, two previously released expansions (Plaice deck and Salmon deck), and two new expansions (Trout deck and Besoekende deck), along with extra components, among them new guest meeples.&#10;&#10;"
