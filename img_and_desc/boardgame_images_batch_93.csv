10626,,"PACIFIC WAR CLASSICS VOLUME 1: The Island Battles of Tarawa and Saipan consists of two games in one package. The battles at Tarawa and Saipan are depicted on separate game maps and use two separate game systems. Although the Fresno Gaming Association was probably guilty of plagiarism in some of their game designs, their graphic presentation was always first class and this game is no exception.&#10;&#10;The Island Battle of Saipan uses the system that FGA previously used in their OPERATION CRUSADER game. This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.&#10;&#10;The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls. Each hex on the Tarawa map represents 35 yards from hexside to opposite hexside and a Game Turn represents 2 hours.&#10;&#10;9&quot; x 12&quot; x 2&quot; bookcase style game box; &#10;16-page (8?&quot; x 11&quot;) Rules booklet; &#10;two 22&quot; x 34&quot; unmounted game maps; &#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; unmounted game map; &#10;960 die-cut, back-printed, unpunched, cardboard counters; &#10;five card-stock Player Aids; and &#10;a 10-sided die.&#10;&#10;"

The opposite signs attracts, the matching signs repel and you can stack your pieces and knock your opponents out. You win by getting your pieces to the opposing side.&#10;&#10;Apparently this is a long long game, too long to be much fun, too awkward for tactics to endure.&#10;&#10;"

10630,,"Memoir '44  is a historical boardgame where players face-off in stylized battles of some of the most famous historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra and the Ardennes.&#10;&#10;Memoir '44 includes over 15 different battle scenarios and features a double-sided hex game board for both beach landings and countryside combat. Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.&#10;&#10;&quot;By design, the game is not overly complex&quot;, says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. &quot;The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.&quot; In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.&#10;&#10;Memoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. With Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.&#10;&#10;The Memoir &#039;44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.&#10;&#10;This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.&#10;&#10;"

Essentially, one player takes Nixon and up to seven play as challengers, with Nixon trying to knock them off one by one as Primary cards come up. Players still roll to land on states and buy them, and other players pay a fee when landing on them afterwards. But buying states requires a combination of two forms of currency: money and media points. Many state spaces also trigger event and media cards, which have different effects on Nixon and challengers.&#10;&#10;Key to the game are the four Primary cards in the Event deck. Each time one of these comes up, Nixon rolls off with the top-ranking challenger, and whichever has the highest electoral vote total gets +2 on the 2D6. Loser is out of the game, winner grabs a state of his choice from the loser, and the rest goes back to the bank. There is a &ldquo;saved by the bell&rdquo; re-entry card in the deck that allows a loser to stay in the game.&#10;&#10;There also is a provision for the challengers to join forces if Nixon seems about to win, but only if they can agree on which challenger should be the winner instead! The decks include blank Media and Event cards to allow players to customize the game.&#10;&#10;"

Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios are provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. An additional dozen scenarios can be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;T #115 (Kanev).

There's a total of 15 items in 5 different colours in the game, the fleamarket stalls have space for 1-3 items, and a rotating disc under the game board keeps the prices for the various stalls constantly changing; the idea is to be in the right place at the right time to buy cheap and sell dear. Hand limit is 3 items, but a player may buy/sell 2 at a time if they are of the same colour, and if there's space in the stall they happen to be at. A stall may be out of use due to a coffee break (the &quot;coffee cup&quot; symbol) and two special squares force players either to give or take money from an opponent. For movement, players can choose between roll-and-move or fixed movement rules.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player who first gets 250 money.&#10;&#10;"

Once the crown jewel of Czarist Russia, Leningrad is now the second most important city in the Soviet Union. Its array of ordnance factories includes the massive Kirov Tank Works that turns out most of the heavy KV-1 and KV-2 production for the Soviet Army. Loss of Leningrad would deprive the Soviets of a major population and industrial center and give the Germans the advantage of position in any drive against Moscow from the northwest.&#10;&#10;Army Group North, short of Luftwaffe support and motorized forces, is the only army group that fails to achieve a significant encirclement at any stage of its campaign. Skillfully utilizing terrain and ruthlessly exploiting the civilian population, the Soviets construct a fortified line along the Luga River that stalls the Germans for a month until massive Luftwaffe and motorized reinforcements from Army Group Center allow a decisive breakthrough and dash for Leningrad itself. In a furious September battle, the Germans fall just short of taking Leningrad when time runs out. Operation Typhoon, the final push against Moscow, is imminent. Army Group North must give up almost all of its Luftwaffe and motorized formations. With no strike force remaining, the Germans dig in. Leningrad survives capture only to endure a brutal, epic 900 day siege.&#10;&#10;Can you, as the Axis commander, succeed where German High Command failed?

10659,,"This is a card game that forces a Hex token around the table between players. In this respect, it's sort of a game of Hot Potato. Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards &quot;blows up,&quot; thus losing points. Naturally, there are nuances to this. There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.&#10;&#10;There are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.&#10;&#10;Scores are kept with individual cards monitoring &quot;Voice&quot;, which is just points. How many you have at the end of the x+1 rounds determines who the winner is.&#10;&#10;One last amusing thing about the game is a bit of chaos tossed in; a Hex Hex card; when it's played, all players have to drop their card hands and put their hands in the air. The slowpoke loses points. Not exactly strategy, but still entertaining.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Hex Hex Next&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Hex Hex XL&#10;&#10;&#10;"

It's a move-by-dice game with the die modified by cards you must pick up whenever you overtake an opponent on a bend. Mods include extra/lost spaces/turns, enforced/canceled pit stops, retirement, or (many) no changes. Some of those mods are whole positions rather than spaces - it must start getting a bit random and skill-less. The lap is 39 spaces long and the track is only 1 space wide with only 2 cars allowed per space so there's going to be lots of blocking: however it is obviously a 'ladder' game and not one where skill predominates over other factors to any great extent. One of the cards takes out the car you're overtaking as well as yours! A couple force a race restart.... You can forgo part of your move by declining to overtake in some situations, to avoid picking up a card. A few spaces on the straights have optional card pickup as well.&#10;Shame there's not a big skill factor, because those cars are really nice.&#10; (From a Micro-Review by David Budd)&#10;http://people.man.ac.uk/~zlsiida/text_files/mrbg-rev.html#cpgpc&#10;&#10;"

Each lot is also marked with a Roman numeral from I-V.  Players have sets of cards with the same numbers - on each round every player selects a card to be auctioned, but these are all shuffled together so no one knows exactly what will be available.  The gimmicks are that the winner of each auction can choose any like-numbered lot to own, and that the winning bid goes to the person who played the card, but no one knows who that is until the auctions are over.&#10;&#10;Each lot has an intrinsic value based on the size of the section it is in, the bigger the section the more valuable.  However, a player can double or triple the value of his or her lots in a section by owning a majority or all of them, which is of course easier to do in a small section.  When a section is full the lot values are put into accounts for each player - these accounts earn interest every round, and the players are allowed to add a certain amount of cash to them as well.  The interest can be significant but withdrawing money from the account before the end of the game is somewhat painful.&#10;&#10;"
