During this time, they brought stunning technological innovation and scientific advancements to their domain. This accelerated progression helped the Domineum reach &mdash; and eventually inhabit &mdash; even the farthest segments of the known galaxy, where new Houses emerged to govern the outer sectors of the empire. As the House of Novarchon grew in power, so grew the religious cult that surrounded them, proclaiming grim prophecies about an ancient cosmic being from another dimension: the Voidborn.&#10;&#10;Many thought it to be only a myth, but in truth, it was the Voidborn's dark influence that granted the Novarchs the sheer knowledge to achieve rapid expansion for the empire. While the cult of the Novarchs envisaged eternal life through the otherworldly entity, the Voidborn's only intention was satiating its eternal hunger. And so, when the Domineum had achieved a vastness fitting the Voidborn's craving, interdimensional rifts opened at the heart of the Domineum to unleash cosmic corruption. As the House of Novarchon and its followers welcomed the Voidborn and sought their false salvation, the entity infected and spread and seized control over the inner worlds. Now, it is time for the remaining Great Houses to purge the galactic corruption, prevent the Voidborn from fully manifesting in our dimension, and to ultimately overcome the chaos as the new rulers of the Domineum.&#10;&#10;Voidfall is a space 4X game that brings the genre to Euro enthusiasts' tables. It combines the tension, player interaction, and deep empire customization of the 4X genre with the resource management, tight decisions, and minimum-luck gameplay of an economic Euro. Win by pushing back the Voidborn in the solo/coop mode, or by overcoming your rivals' influence in restoring the Domineum in the competitive mode &mdash; both using the same rule set and game system. Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.&#10;&#10;As the leader of a defiant Great House, you play through three cycles, each with a game-altering galactic event, a new scoring condition, and a set number of focus cards that can be played. Focus card decisions and sequencing is the centerpiece of the gameplay. By selecting two of their three impactful actions as you play them, you develop and improve techs; advance on your three house-specific civilization tracks; manage your sectors' infrastructure, population, and production; and conquer new sectors with up to five different types of space fleets. Space battles are fought either against the Voidborn's infected forces (which are present as neutral opponents even in the competitive mode) or against other players. Instead of relying on the luck of a die roll, battles in Voidfall are fully deterministic and reward careful preparation and outsmarting your opponents.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The catch is: If card played divides into the sum without remainder then it may not be deducted but must divide. (For instance a 5 played to 20 must divide for 4 rather than deduct for 15, whereas a 3 must deduct since it can't divide into 20 evenly.)&#10;&#10;An Ace counts either 1 or 11. A Jack played repeats the same value as the previous card. A Queen reverses the digits of the current count. However, you may only play a Queen if reversing the digits reduces the count. A King divides by any desired number higher than 1 and lower than the current, provided that it leaves no remainder.&#10;&#10;The hand ends when one player plays their last card or is unable to play without going below zero.&#10;&#10;"

As the magnetic field over Mars weakened, radiation began to dry up the seas and solar winds caused the atmosphere to deplete. This in turn reduced the planet&rsquo;s ability to maintain heat. After centuries of research, Mars&rsquo; leading scientists have developed a way to slow the depletion of oxygen and the cooling of the planet; however, it&rsquo;s too little and far too late. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the planet becomes completely uninhabitable. In this harsh environment, the few remaining races of Mars dangle from their last thread of existence.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;Each player will represent a leader of one of the remaining races of ancient Mars.

Players will also need to maintain control of lands to provide food, water and other resources&mdash;a task which may require force. Players will take turns placing multi-use cards on action spaces. The action space chosen will determine which part of the player&rsquo;s card is activated (political, civil, or military). As the game progresses, players will expand their influence to gain more powerful actions, develop technologies to help combat the planet&rsquo;s condition, gather resources to help keep their populace happy, and train armies to maintain their lands and resources.

One side contains a dragon and treasure, the other a wizard and spell. Dragons are used to attack your opponent's treasure and defend your own. Treasure is used to pay for wizards. Wizards can also steal treasure directly, or ride similarly-colored dragons for even more points. Spells can be cast by wizards to directly manipulate the battlefield, for example rotating or flipping cards, or scoring points. Each side of a card can only be used if the text is facing you, and all cards rotate after use. For example after attacking with a dragon it rotates to reveal its treasure, which makes it vulnerable to attack.&#10;&#10;It is always a thrill to chain together a sequence of spells to flip and rotate cards, culminating in a massive points-scoring attack.

Each player has one special skill from the character and must use them wisely throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one of the players will be the Maecenas and make a request. Each artist must choose one card in hand that best fits the Maecenas demand, the closer you get to it, the more points you get.&#10;&#10;For the production of Art Gallery, the game designer Igor Colares invited dozens of people, among them children, adults, professional illustrators and amateurs. For each one, Igor asked for an art and said a feeling and an element. The artists then created based on that request. What we have as a result is an incredible variation of styles and a fun walk through the subjectivity of each person.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Then you draw exactly three butt groups from the butt bag. Once you have drawn all the butts from the butt bag, you choose which one butt group you want to score. Not only you yourself though but everybody will get butt points for each of their butts in the butt group that you are scoring. The next player will then add a random special butt to the butt bag before they, too, draw all the butts. These change the game up a little but, more importantly, each player butt is also worth an additional butt point for each special butt that is in play.&#10;&#10;Once you reach at least 28 butt points, the game ends with the next reset. A reset happens either because a player decides against adding another special butt to the bag or because there happens to be one or more special butts in each of the three butt groups that a player draws. Just because you are the first player who reaches 28 butt points does not necessarily mean that you will actually win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
