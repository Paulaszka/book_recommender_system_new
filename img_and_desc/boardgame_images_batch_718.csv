On the room boards there are 5 empty spaces for the &quot;Hideouts&quot;.&#10;Players receive randomly 5 hideout counters each and place them &ldquo;covered&rdquo; in front of them.&#10;Finally all kittens are placed in the garden which is in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get rid of all the hideout counters before your opponents. Each counter should be placed on its appropriate slot, according to the shape and color of the room.&#10;How to do it? Each turn a player move his own cat (the one corresponding to the color of his room&rsquo;s frame) and according to the his counters he chooses the room where hiding the cat. If he chooses his own room then he can place the cat on any slot of his choice. But if he chooses to move his cat to a room controlled by an opponent, it&rsquo;s up to the owner to choose where to place it.&#10;&#10;When your cat is placed on a slot that corresponds to one of your hideout counters (according to the shape and color of the room), discover it and place it on the corresponding position; but remember, each room cannot host more than one cat because they are not willing to share a territory. If you place your cat on a board occupied by another cat, the brawl starts.&#10;&#10;After this phase starts the &ldquo;Housekeeper moment&ldquo;.&#10;The current player rolls a die. All players compete to grab the matching colored kitten, wherever it is. The fastest hand moves the caught kitten to the garden and pass one of his remained counters, of his choice, to the player with less counters. If there are 2 or more opponents with the same number of counters left, he can choose the target. However he can never pass his last counter, which must necessarily be placed on the appropriate slot.&#10;&#10;The first player that remains with no hideout counters is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

But beware the really hungry wolf!&#10;&#10;Each side (the wolf and the sheep) has a different deck. The cards of the wolf are face down in a stack while every sheep card is displayed on the table. In turns each player chooses one card for the herd and applies the movement depicted in it (from one to three arrows in every direction but downhill) trying to take the majority of the herd into the uphill sheepfold. After that he reveals a wolf card and must apply its movement, which may result in the wolf capturing one of the sheep.&#10;&#10;Players share the victory if at least 6 sheep (out of 10) arrive safe to the top.&#10;&#10;"

The game is based on the highly successful Commands &amp; Colors game system, where the Command cards drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution, however, introduces many new game concepts, which will add historical depth and provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors player many new play experiences and challenges.&#10;&#10;The scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger American Revolution battles, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. In some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire brigade, while in others a unit may only represent a few companies of soldiers. Still the linear tactics of the period, that you will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various American Revolution Armies of the day, and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought. To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the British and Continental forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards.&#10;&#10;Players, that are familiar with other Commands &amp; Colors games, will soon note that unit combat losses in a Tricorne game are typically not as great as other games covered in the Commands &amp; Colors series. This is a direct result of the linear tactic fighting style of the armies that fought during the American Revolution. Unit morale is the main thematic focus in a Tricorne battle as it was historically. Knowing that an entire unit, that has only taken minimal losses when forced to retreat, may actually break and rout from the battlefield, will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.&#10;&#10;The 12 battles, showcased in the scenario section of this booklet, feature a stylized battlefield map that emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. These scenarios are a smattering of some of the better-known engagements of the American Revolution.&#10;&#10;Bunker Hill -17 June 1775&#10;Long Island (Grant's Attack) - 27 August 1776&#10;Long Island (British Flank March) - 27 August 1776&#10;Freeman's Farm - 19 September 1777&#10;Bemis Heights - 7 October 1777&#10;Bemis Heights (British Redoubts) - 7 October 1777&#10;Monmouth - 28 June 1778&#10;Camden - 16 August 1780&#10;Cowpens - 17 January 1781&#10;Guilford Courthouse - 15 March 1781&#10;Hobkirk's Hill - 25 April 1781&#10;Eutaw Springs - 8 September 1781&#10;&#10;"

Players gather minions great and small, ranging from Riff-Raff to Horrible Monsters, battle each other, and fend off attacks by occasional do-gooders (such as adventuring bands and small children). The game takes about an hour to play.&#10;&#10;The goal is to eliminate all other players and become the Big Bad Overlord. Players start with six cards, half of which they can keep face-down. The face-up cards serve as the players' armies and can be used to attack other players. Each turn, players draw a new card and add it to their army. (Unless they draw a do-gooder, in which case the player has to fight it off!) There are three combat abilities - Mind control, Magic, and Melee. Most cards have at least one ability, and some have more. A successful Mind-control attack allows you to capture an enemy card; magic blows things up (especially cards weak against magic, such as the otherwise powerful Machines-O-Death); and melee allows you to chop things up.&#10;&#10;Players fight each other using all available attacks, rolling 2 six-sided dice to determine the winner of each battle. Die rolls are modified according to the relative attack and defense strengths of each side's army in each combat category. But even the most lopsided of battles isn't in vain - a natural 12 always wins, no matter what the modifiers, and a natural 2 always fails.&#10;&#10;In addition to the evil minions and do-gooders, the deck contains two magical artifacts. They're important because players need them to survive the endgame. When all the cards are drawn from the deck, only players who have an artifact survive. At that point, if two players are still in the game, there's a final battle in which the evil Dukes use the artifacts to smash each other's troops.&#10;&#10;Players can gang up on each other, help each other defend against attack, backstab each other, and more. Defeat your foes, play them against each other, hoard a precious artifact or obtain one at all costs - Big Bad Overlord is a game where it's good to be bad.&#10;&#10;"

As&#10;more damage is received, more Sectors&#10;go into shutdown, making those cards&#10;unavailable for purchase, as well as&#10;potentially causing damage to a player&rsquo;s&#10;Organization.&#10;As Organizations take damage, their&#10;Cohesion drops; a measure of their overall&#10;strength, morale, leadership, and ability to keep&#10;fighting. If an Organization&rsquo;s Cohesion ever drops&#10;to 0, they retreat from the Facility and are&#10;out of the game.&#10;The last player remaining in the game&#10;is the winner as they seize control of the&#10;Facility and its exotic treasures!&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Each player, playing as 1 of 7 unique goblins, takes turns visiting and building various locations in and around their dungeon. From flame throwing turrets, to sharkodile moats, to poison traps, players must work semi-cooperatively to build each location to perfection before the King's royal guard shows up.&#10;&#10;If all three primary defenses are constructed before the King's Royal Guard arrives, the Loyal goblin players win the game. If the Royal Guard reaches the dungeon before that happens, the hidden Spy will win.&#10;&#10;Players achieve global and, more importantly, individual rewards for completing construction phases of a particular defensive structure. But beware! Your fellow goblins may not be as loyal as you! Each player has a hidden identity card and plays as either a Loyal Goblin, a Spy, a Selfish Jerk, or an Anarchist.&#10;&#10;Each Loyalty type has its own win conditions. &#10;&#10;     If the Royal Guard shows up before the defenses are built, the Spy player wins&#10;     If the defenses are built before the Royal Guard shows up,&#10;         The Anarchist wins if the Anarchy Track is high enough, otherwise&#10;         The Selfish Jerk wins if he/she has accumulated enough individual glory, otherwise&#10;         The remaining Loyal players win.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Stay Out of My Dungeon! combines the fun of hidden identity games and the camaraderie of cooperative play into one strategically rich yet easy to learn board game.&#10;&#10;"
