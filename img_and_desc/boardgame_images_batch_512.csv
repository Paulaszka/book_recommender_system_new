The Pope and the Empire, the two universal powers that dominated the previous centuries, were breaking apart. Science and technology were beginning to flourish again. Society was rapidly changing, as cities revived and gained autonomy while the feudal system was starting to crumble. &#10;In Medioevo Universale, you have to lead one of the great kingdoms of those times, while taking control of trade, diplomacy, infrastructure development, scientific progress, and military strategy. Build forts and fortifications, bring war to your enemies, conquer new lands, discover new technologies, expand your commerce, repel the barbarians on the frontiers, recruit armies and fleets, forge alliances, and defeat your opponents in battle!&#10;&#10;Medioevo Universale is a game full of components (more than 1700!) with many aspects to manage, deep interactions with other players, and the ability to give you an immersive experience in the medieval era.&#10;&#10;In addition of the normal game rules, the box contains also the original prototype rulebook of Nicola Iannone and the elements to play his experimental game version.&#10;&#10;"

Each player begins the game controlling a cowboy that is pre-generated. The cowboys start the game in the end of a canyon near their home town just after being caught in a flash flood on their way back from a cattle drive. Throughout the canyon they see materials scattered all over and someone remembers the payroll was on the chuck-wagon and probably in one of those piles of rubble. Suddenly the players begin to eye each other suspiciously as each decides they want all the gold for themselves. To make matters worse some of the other members of the cattle drive, the ones that didn't survive are getting up and moving towards the cowboys with a hungry look in their eyes. Most of the cowboys are armed with a six gun, but these zombies are endless and their ammo isn't. Now the cowboys must work together against the army of undead in order to survive, but in the back of each cowboy's mind is the payroll, and the chance that one of their fellow cowboys will turn on them.&#10;&#10;The main objective of the game is to escape the canyon alive. However if multiple players escape the canyon then the player with the most gold is declared the winner. For a single player game the player must search all twenty boxes and escape the canyon alive.&#10;&#10;Ages: 8+ &#10;Games will last approximately a half hour to an hour.&#10;&#10;"

The game supports 2-4 players and is played over the course of 45 minutes.  The game contains mechanisms that are not normally seen in educational games, and the effect is learning through engagement (fun).  It also features attractive youth-friendly graphic design to further increase the accessibility, engagement and desire to play.  Don't Push Your Luck combines light strategy of a family Euro with the fun and social exploration of a Party Game.&#10;&#10;Just Another Day&#10;Each player in Don&rsquo;t Push Your Luck takes on the role of a child with hemophilia competing to have the most well balanced lifestyle, while trying to manage the risk they take in their activities. Players will be faced with the constant challenge of balancing of risk vs reward.  The game is played over three rounds, each representing one full day.&#10;&#10;There is a central board surrounded by 16 activity cards, that are randomly drawn before the beginning of each round.  Each activity card represents a specific type of health: mental, social, emotional, and physical.  In turn, players go around the board picking up activity cards and placing them in their player area.  This represent them performing this activity.  For example: on your turn you may choose to take the &ldquo;hockey&rdquo; activity card.  Hockey provides 2 physical icons on it.  These icons are later used to obtain &ldquo;stars&rdquo;, at the various &ldquo;star spaces&rdquo; around the board.  The player with the most &ldquo;stars&rdquo; at the end of the game is declared the winner. &#10;  &#10;Inciting Discussion&#10;Players must be mindful of the activities they choose to participate in during the day, because at the end of every round (3 total), each player tells a story about their day by describing each of the activities they selected.  When the storyteller is finished telling describing each of their selected activities, the other players have an opportunity to discuss which of those activities they felt were not in the best interest of the story teller.   The storyteller will often be trying to play down the risk of their selected activities, as they will be judged by the other players.&#10;&#10;"
