Although it was sparsely populated, many of the inhabitants were desperate and dangerous.  The West had always been home to large groups of American natives, but now had been receiving various undesirables such as cattle rustlers, gamblers, vigilantes, and banditos.  For the most part, those coming West were hungry for gold and were willing to do just about anything to get it.  Many found it too tiresome trying to get rich panning and digging, and instead found it more convenient to steal or kill for it.  As a consequence, it became the common practice not only for nearly everyone to carry a firearm, but also for nearly everyone to use one.  Needless to say gangs, posses, and gunfights were common parts of every day life.  Anybody with a gun had an opportunity to make a name and gain infamy in the great American West.&#10;&#10;It is exactly this setting in which you find yourself in.  You have the option of choosing one of seven notorious gunfighters of the old American West:  Kid Rango, Chief War Wind, Pablo &lsquo;The Pistol&rsquo; Perez, Walter Winston, Raging Arrow, Luther &lsquo;The Lawman&rsquo; Hale, or Little Pancho.  Besides the 7 posse bosses, Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail also comes with an additional 42 gunfighters.  Each boss and gunfighter comes with their own mugshot and unique battle stats.  With your posse boss, recruit a gang from the various cities to ride out to face your rivals.  Dodge ruthless banditos, determined lawmen, and hostile natives to get to your next gig.  You can knock off the Bank of the Nation, rustle up some cattle, or take on the Union Pacific Railroad.  You can also track down the other gunslingers to collect the bounties on their heads.  The way you stack your posse, the strategy you employ, and knowing when to strike will always give you the edge.  Each boss comes with his own clutch skills that come in handy when the chips are down.  No matter how many times you play, the scenarios are endless and the game never looks the same twice.  The winner is the posse that bags the most gold, even if they end up in pine boxes.&#10;&#10;With Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail, you get three  distinct games in the Gunslinger series.  You get everything you need to play Gunslinger Shootout (arena style combat), Gunslinger Showdown (mano y mano confrontation), and Gunslinger Roundup (recruit your posse, collect the bounties, and get the gold). Anybody can get lucky and be a hero!  It takes one shot in the right spot.&#10;&#10;"

Pennsylvania leans Democratic by 4 percentage points (based on a historical average of recent presidential elections). That 4% point lean is reflected by four blue chips placed on PA during setup. Virginia, as you can see in the image, leans Red by 5% points (chips). As players campaign and advertize in these states, the chip stacks rise and fall and often flip from one color to the other.&#10;&#10;A big part of the fun is that Swing State is a game that is easy to learn, easy to set up, and easy to play, but has a very rich mix of strategies that change each time you play.

The initial choice of Divine or Demonic will heavily influence the various winning strategies you will be able to pursue, but fear not: There are plenty of ways to switch your cards from Divine to Demonic or vice versa, and building decks using cards from both &quot;Factions&quot; is an option as well...

My intention here was to make a more consistent game, regarding to the formulation of its rules. I wanted the game to have two basic, simple rules. I was concerned about keeping the concept of simultaneity of actions at all times. Some features of GO, such as &quot;once a piece is placed, it can not move,&quot; are not really consistent at all times in the unfolding of the game, regarding the concept with which they were raised. I tried to get rid of all philosophical inconsistency at the time of defining the rules of this game.&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;&#10;Pieces&#10;The pieces are circular. These pieces are characterized in that each has a range (a circular area whose diameter is three times the diameter of the piece). Each piece has one side painted white and the other black (like in Othello), and each player may chose one side (color) to play (then, the color of a piece is defined only when that piece is placed on the board, and keeps that color has long has its still on the board). Both sides have in the center a gray circle (its just decorative), whose diameter is equal to a quarter of the pieces' diameter. &#10;To tell if a piece is within the range of another, just take a piece and place it over the two pieces. If the piece used to measure is supported by the two pieces, one can ensure that a piece is within the range of the other (and vice versa).&#10;A total of 152 pieces are needed.&#10;&#10;Board&#10;The board has two concentric squares: the peripheral (whose side is equal to 19x the diameter of the pieces) and the central (whose side is equal to 17x the diameter of the pieces). The peripheral defines the playing area, and acts has a neutral piece (&quot;gray piece&quot;). In this sense, the central delimits its range.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;    At the start of the game the board is empty. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player can do one or two &quot;relocation&quot; moves. If he cant, the game ends, and that player loses.&#10;&#10;&#10;Notes about the terms used:&#10;&quot;Belt&quot;: a group of pieces conforms a &quot;belt&quot; if every piece of the group is within the range of at least two of the other pieces of the group.&#10;&quot;Conditioned&quot;: a piece is not &quot;conditioned&quot; to a player when it is over the board, with his color facing the board, and since the group of pieces that are within its range (regardless of color) do not conform a belt. &#10;&quot;Relocate&quot;: a player makes a &quot;relocation&quot; move when he takes a &quot;conditioned&quot; piece from the board or from the outside of the board, and then places it on an empty place over the board or at the outside of the board.&#10;&#10;"

Players take the roles of the two teams who've made it to the championship game. The rules of sheep soccer are vastly different than the game played by humans. So, players will need to strategically place their sheep throughout the board as they jump, nudge, kick, and block the ball as they try score.&#10;&#10;Sheep Soccer is a strategy game for two where players use their three sheep pawns to try and score three goals before their opponent.&#10;&#10;"

Interfere with each other&rsquo;s paintings and compete to win the world&rsquo;s greatest treasure: Points!&#10;&#10;On your turn, draw a card from the central display. If it is a Commission card, keep it at your side for scoring at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If it is a tree card, you may add it to any player's tree. If you make a contiguous limb of cards sharing one or more features, you score 1 point for each instance of those features in that contiguous group.&#10;&#10;If you score more than 10 points in a turn, remove the scoring cards and the owner of the tree collects them as &quot;pruned&quot; branches.&#10;&#10;Then reveal a new card in the central display. If there are ever three Commissions in the display, discard them all and replenish the display with three new cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;"
