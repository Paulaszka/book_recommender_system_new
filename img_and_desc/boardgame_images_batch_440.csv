In Ki there is no Ko and there is no Komi. A game of Ki cannot end in a draw.&#10;&#10;Ki is played with standard Go equipment on any odd sized square board. 11x11 is a good size to start on.&#10;&#10;The objective of Ki is to have more stones on the board when the board is full. Note that completely filling the board will not be necessary to determine the outcome of a game as many of the placements will become obvious towards the end.&#10;&#10;Starting with black, players alternate placing stones. A player must have at least 2 stones orthogonally adjacent to a space in order to control it. A player controls a space when he owns a majority of the stones orthogonally adjacent to the space. If the space is occupied by his opponent, the enemy stone is removed from play. If a space is surrounded by an equal number of stones of both colors, it is a legal placement for either player. It is forbidden for a player to place a stone on a space controlled by his opponent, even to make a capture. If a player has no legal move on his turn he must pass. Passing is otherwise not permitted.&#10;&#10;"

Each team has only 10 pawns (instead of 15). There are 4 forwards in RuckBowl, and each forward represents 2 real forwards. The n&deg;10 in RuckBowl represents the real fly-half and the real scrum-half. So the 10 pawns in RuckBowl represent 15 real players. Why 10 pawns? Because it is easier to manipulate 10 pawns than 15 pawns. The game becomes quicker and more nervous with 10 pawns.&#10;RuckBowl uses a square-grid board: 15 columns by 28 lines : almost the BloodBowl pitch...&#10;&#10;The game is played taking turns: each turn is divided in two segments: Segment I for placing players and launching play, and Segment II for the current play.&#10;&#10;What happens in the Segment I :&#10;Kick-off, Re-start Kick, 22 m drop out, Scrum, Lineout, Penalty kick.&#10;&#10;There is several options in the Segment II: &#10;Option 1. The coach moves his players, passes the ball, kicks the ball, attempt crash charges or tackles, or attempt a drop-goal, &#10;Option 2 or 3. The coach declares a Ruck or a Maul. &#10;Option 4. The coach declares a Mark.&#10;&#10;Some actions need dice rolls: tackle, crash charge, kick, Ruck, Maul, Scrum, etc. A bad die roll can lead to a Scrum, a penalty, or a turn-over, etc. The opposition can react by: intercepting the ball, tackling the ball carrier, catching a kicked ball, etc... Each team can score with Try, Drop Goal, and Penalty Kick. And don&rsquo;t forget: passing the ball to a team mate in front of you is totally forbidden !&#10;&#10;RuckBowl is a game where you must make the good decision all the time : what can I make ? pass the ball, kick, kicking in touch, move the ball carrier, declare a ruck ?&#10;&#10;In order to customize your team, you can use Team cards.&#10;&#10;Each player has his own profile :&#10;Move (for...movements).&#10;Power (for melees : scrum, ruck, maul).&#10;Catch (for catching the free ball, after a kick or a bounce).&#10;Impact (for tackles).&#10;Pass (for passes).&#10;Kick (when the ball is kicked).&#10;&#10;RuckBowl is a complex game, for 14 year old (or more).&#10;&#10;"

Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors. Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue. Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next. Can you help him with his haunting and quickly name the right item, or even make it disappear by yourself? If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning...&#10;&#10;The lightning fast shape and color recognition game that is sure to test the reflexes of kids, families and gamers alike. In Ghost Blitz, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book, and a comfortable red chair. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?&#10;&#10;&#10;    If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.&#10;&#10;&#10;The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected.

The green player draws the top key card.  It tells you the scales that you have to form to win the game, and it must stay hidden until the end of the game.  The blue player does the same.  The rest of the key cards are put away.&#10;&#10;The green player always goes first.  He/she draws an interval card, showing it to their opponent.  The card tells how many squares you can move one &quot;note&quot; as well as the direction that can be moved.&#10;&#10;Game play continues until one of the players has formed their scales, and shouts &quot;I win&quot; or something similar.  If this is shouted and the player has not formed their correct scales, play continues and that player loses a turn.

The drunken elephant moves one space in any direction except directly backwards, and the crown prince moves exactly like a king because it is a second king. Namely both the crown prince and the king must be bared, checkmated and/or stalemated simultaneously to win. Baring counting as a draw only if one's own king can be bared the next move.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 (Drunk Elephant still present) and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi).&#10;&#10;"

The clues offer rules for the particular game card.  For example, the clues may state that a blue bear sits after a red bear, or that a green bear cannot sit after a blue bear.  The players, then, must use logic in order to solve the card.&#10;&#10;There are eleven different puzzles included in the box.&#10;&#10;The game can be played solo, cooperative or competitively.  In the competitive mode, players divide the bears amongst themselves.  On a turn, the player will roll the colour die and may place a bear of that colour on the puzzle.  Making a wrong placement results in a two turn penalty.  The player to correctly place his last bear on the puzzle wins.&#10;&#10;"

A player is allowed to activate his units one at a time until he fails an activation roll, at which time play passes to the opponent. Units which have not moved, or fail to activate, are able to use reaction fire. Movement is measured from a short list of available actions, run, walk, assault, etc. Combat is resolved using a die roll-savings throw mechanic, with saving throws only if the target wears armor. Hits result in Suppression or Casualties, with more experienced units able to take more suppression hits before casualties are inflicted. vehicles are treated generically, but with a choice of armor &amp; weapons.&#10;&#10;Force list, weapon choices and vehicle details are left to the player, although fan-produced lists have been posted on the game website.&#10;&#10;FUBAR has a range of rules and supplements including these genre:&#10;&#10;    FUBAR 40K Boarding Actions - Space Hulk and Space Crusade&#10;    FUBAR Generic Sci-Fi&#10;    FUBAR Stargate1&#10;    FUBAR Star Wars - Hoth battle &#10;    FUBAR Clone Wars&#10;    FUBAR Starship Troopers&#10;    FUBAR Steampunk&#10;    FUBAR Warhammer 40K&#10;    FUBAR Warzone&#10;    FUBAR Hammers Slammers&#10;    FUBAR Imperial Commander&#10;    FUBAR 15mm SciFi&#10;    FUBAR Micro FUBAR - 6mm scale&#10;    FUBAR Vietnam&#10;    FUBAR WW2&#10;    FUBAR Afghanistan&#10;    FUBAR Horror &#10;&#10;&#10;"

All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.&#10; First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).&#10;&#10;With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so. Some slight changes of the original rules work with that map as well as the rules of the first edition.&#10;&#10;"

Communist movements have sprung up throughout Europe. Trotsky, Lenin and Stalin plan to blast through Poland in order to support the red revolutions in Germany, France and England. Only the armies of Poland stand in the way of the Bolshevik tide. Strike of the Eagle models the battles and historical events of the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.&#10;&#10;To simulate the tension of the era from the fog of war, players alternate placing secret orders on their armies in order to bluff, mislead and misdirect their opponents. These concealed orders make it difficult to deduce an opponent's plans and are used to hide a player's true intentions and objectives. Players then reveal and resolve the issued orders. They can then disrupt their opponent's moves, cut off supply and much more. Once orders are resolved the next turn begins.&#10;&#10;Units are represented by wooden blocks. Battles are fought with no dice, but with a simple and quick combat system.&#10;&#10;Action cards are pivotal to the game in that they allow players to either modify how many orders they may issue, add army reinforcements or modify a battle's resolution.[...]&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle includes several scenarios for 2-4 players. Some are short games that can be played in an hour, up to the full campaign that can last several hours.&#10;&#10;The map portrays a portion of Eastern Europe in 1920. It is divided into areas that are named after local cities to simplify scenario setups. Along the outer edge of the map is a grid to help find areas during game setup. Each area name is followed by its grid location.&#10;The map is divided into two fronts; the northern and the southern. The front line is designated by a yellow line that runs from east to west. In 4 player scenarios, each allied player commands blocks on one front only. If a block of one player crosses the line between fronts, it moves to the control of his ally at the beginning of the next Operation Phase.&#10;&#10;The Fog of War series is a card driven game where Divisions and Brigades are represented as blocks. These blocks stand upright during the game to prevent opponents from knowing their strength or unit type and can only be revealed during combat or through Recon Area orders given during each Operation Phase.&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle is divided into a number of Rounds, each Round being subdivided into a number of identical phases. The Round Phase Track marks the game's progression. Each round is divided into the Replenish Cards Phase, five identical Operation Phases, and a Reinforcement Phase.&#10;Each side has a pool of order counters to draw from. These order counters represent the various types of orders each unit or group may be given. These orders, which range from Forced Marches to Reconnaissance actions, allow the player to strategically manouver his Divisions and Brigades. Orders are placed face down, leading to guesswork and strategic anticipation on the part of your opponent!&#10;&#10;The sequence of placing and executing orders is determined by the player(s) with the higher initiative. Each front has its own initiative track. Initiative is gained and lost as the game progresses. Whether to place first or second is an important strategic element of the game!&#10;&#10;Strike of the Eagle is a card driven game. Each card is broken up into a number of different parts and each card can be played for either its event as listed in the body of the card, to increase the number of orders available in a phase (uppermost left), for the combat value on the card (uppermost right), or for reinforcements (lowermost left).&#10;&#10;Supply is important in Stike of the Eagle. If units are out of supply they will fight less well, take much greater losses, and lose the advantage of any Garrison which might be located at their city.&#10;&#10;(from Academy Games website)&#10;&#10;"

There are levels of interactions between players, in which you can effect the other players path, while risking your own. The twist is that you can choose your paths to be Light or Dark, giving your path different bonuses. Choose wisely however, because the path you choose will be the path you must finish with.&#10;&#10;"
