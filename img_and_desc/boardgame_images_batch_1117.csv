The box even suggests using the game cards to put on a Church Pageant play.&#10;&#10;The first playstyle involves one player reading the prompt cards aloud to a group of players. In this version, the player who correctly completes the Bible quote receives the card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;The second playstyle involves one player reading the prompt cards and two teams of players competing much like a team spelling bee. The player reading the cards will read to one team, and that team will continue to be asked prompt cards until a teammate misses the answer. After giving an incorrect answer, that player drops out of play, and the reader begins reading to the other team. This continues until only one team remains or the cards are all read. The team with the most players remaining wins.&#10;&#10;Another playstyle involves all the cards being distributed equally to players. Players go around clockwise asking the player to their left to finish the quote. If someone answers correctly, they receive the card. If someone fails to answer correctly, the asker is allowed to steal a card from them. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

This juicy twist on fast-paced favorites like Uno and Gin Rummy is chock-full of cheerful claymation art and surprising disruptors to keep you on your toes.&#10;&#10;Players will encounter ten types of personality-packed Fruits cards of varying point values and must harvest &ldquo;bunches&rdquo; of three or more fruits to earn points. Along the way, action cards will come into play, either multiplying players&rsquo; successes or thwarting their efforts to gather the most fruit; for example: a pie card can double the total value of a bunch, but a grabber card gives an opponent the chance to steal a card&mdash;and all of its potential points&mdash;from another player&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until one lucky fruit collector accumulates a thousand points and wins the game! Hope you&rsquo;ve been eating your fruits, because Fruits requires a dash of luck, a little strategy, and a whole lot of zest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Deluxe uses the same gameplay as Noch mal!, which has also been published as Encore!.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the three color dice and three number dice, then chooses a color and number pairing that allows them to mark off an area on their personal player board. All other players then choose a color-number combination from the dice that remain. By filling all spaces in a column or of a color, you score bonus points.&#10;&#10;Noch mal! Deluxe contains erasable player boards as well as a 3D dice tower that's set up inside the box bottom. What's more, Noch mal! Deluxe contains a co-operative variant played with the same rules in which players need to complete one of the five missions by game's end, whether color bonuses, completed rows, blocks of four, stars, or the spelling of &quot;NOCHMAL&quot;. The game contains the original solo variant as well as a solo challenge using the new missions.&#10;&#10;Admin note: While Noch mal! Deluxe has a 1-4 player count, the Dutch edition of the game &mdash; Keer op Keer Deluxe &mdash; has a 1-6 player count.&#10;&#10;"
