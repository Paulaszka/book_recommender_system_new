Now, with the DC Universe Miniature Game, the stories of these epic battles between superhumans, gods and monsters is at Your fingertips...&#10;&#10;In the DC Universe Miniature Game, You and Your friends collect a set of beautiful miniatures of your favourite DC heroes and villains, bring them to life by painting them, and then using them as playing pieces in an exciting multi-faceted, three dimensional tactical game. Every model in the DC Universe Miniature Games is supplied with a character card, which tracks a model's actions and health during a game. Most importantly, the character card keeps track of a model's Power Counters, which are used to fuel powers and abilities, from flight and teleportation, to heat vision and magical spells.&#10;&#10;Picking models to battle in the DC Universe Miniature Game is really easy, and the game is designed to offer total flexibility in how You assemble Your teams. Firstly You need to decide if Your team is predominantly Heroes or Villains. You can choose any model of the same 'alignment' to join Your team. Some models have a Neutral alignment, which means the can join either team.&#10;&#10;The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play&#10;&#10;Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually up to the character&rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.&#10;     Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up going last in the next.&#10;     Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act have done so.&#10;     Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.&#10;&#10;"

You don&rsquo;t really want to be here. You don&rsquo;t really want to talk to any of these people. You don&rsquo;t really even want to play this game. But you came here for a reason, and you&rsquo;re not going to get it unless you&rsquo;re prepared to engage in a little small talk, the occasional social lubricant, and some generous nodding and smiling. If you play your cards right&mdash;literally in this case&mdash;you might just walk out of here a new person... yeah, who are we kidding, you&rsquo;ll just be happy if you get through the evening with your dignity intact.&quot;&#10;&#10;Awkward Party is a thematic card game, with party game elements, that pokes fun at the bizarre traditions and anxieties that define awkward social gatherings. At the start of the game, each player receives a hand of seven Awkward Party cards (hand limit 7), three Why Am I Even Here? Cards (hand limit), and sets their individual Awkwardness meter to 5. The Party Interest meter is put in the middle of the table and also set to 5. The Awkward Party cards are the main cards that the players play throughout the game with varying effects. They come in a number of categories such as Conversation, Venue, Money, Role, Drink, Support, Romantic Encounter, Rejection, and Something Interesting. The Conversation cards also have their own subjects such as Weather, Movies, Sports, Religion, Politics, and Sex.&#10;&#10;The Why Am I Even Here? cards are the secret objectives each player is trying to complete. They also vary considerably from having a Conversation with all other players to receiving Money from two other players to acquiring the &quot;Someone's Dog&quot; card. Once one of their objectives has been completed, the player must reveal the corresponding Why Am I Even Here? card. In most cases, the winner of the game is the player who has revealed the most Why Am I Even Here? cards. There are a few exceptions such as the &quot;Go Home&quot; and the &quot;Street Cred&quot; Why Am I Even Here? cards, which are only completed and revealed when a particular game-ending event is triggered, even if it is not on the player's turn. If the event is triggered, the player holding the corresponding Why Am I Even Here? card wins the game regardless of how many revealed Why Am I Even Here? cards other players have. The game ends immediately when any one of the following events occurs:&#10;&#10;     A player reveals three completed Why Am I Even Here? cards. &#10;     A player's Awkwardness meter exceeds 10 (and they are forced to leave the party).&#10;     Party Interest drops below 1.&#10;     Party Interest exceeds 10 for the third time and the cops arrive to shut it down.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game-play itself is turn-based. Each player turn has four phases: &#10;&#10;     Play 0-2 Awkward Party cards. &#10;     Discard any number of Awkward Party and/or unrevealed Why Am I Even Here? cards. &#10;     Draw Awkward Party and/or Why Am I Even Here? cards up to the hand limit (revealed Why Am I Even Here? cards still count).&#10;     Reduce Party Interest by 1.&#10;&#10;&#10;If a player plays a conversation card on another player, any player may play another card to join the conversation if their awkwardness is low enough and they have a matching subject. With the exception of Conversation, Rejection, Money, and Support cards, turns can be stolen by other players by playing a card in the same category as the card just played. This card counts as the first card played by the player that just stole the turn. Turn-stealing can be chained, one card at a time, so long as players continue playing cards from the same category.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

For the two player version, please go here: Tokyo Highway&#10;&#10;In Tokyo Highway, players compete to place all of their cars on the road first &mdash; but to do that they have to build the roadways so that they have somewhere for their cars to go!&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players construct columns of varying heights by using the 88 squat gray and yellow pillars in the box, then connect those columns with sticks that serve as roadways, with the column you create usually not being the same height as the one it's connected to. When you place a highway that passes under or over an existing highway, you get to (carefully!) place a car on that highway. Place a highway that both goes over and under other highways, and you can place two cars!&#10;&#10;The yellow cylinders allow you to create a column the same height as another while also allowing you to fork the roadway to create more twists and turns.&#10;&#10;The first player to place all ten of their cars &mdash; with or without using tweezers &mdash; wins!&#10;&#10;This version of Tokyo Highway includes both the original base game and the expansion that allows for games with up to four players &mdash; not to mention four buildings that give additional obstacles while trying to lay down the concrete.&#10;&#10;"

All students and the Anomaly execute their movement behind a player screen, so it's rare to know exactly where another player is.

The cards have inverse abilities for the Anomaly that will give it new powers, like Possess or Teleport.
