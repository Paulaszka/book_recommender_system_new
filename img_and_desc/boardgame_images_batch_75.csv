The thief makes a choice about where on the 76 squares of the gameboard he is. If any other player comes closer he has to say warm, then warmer, then hot. The player who catches the thief becomes the next thief and scores points.&#10;&#10;"

He started a revolt against Assyria, the mighty Elam in the Southeast joined him. In the East, the innumerable Mede tribes become a growing threat. The first signs of a large migration from the North consisting of Cimmerian and Scythian tribes become visible. And all those minor state tribute refusers who need to be punished!

All siege techniques like rams, towers, undermining city walls have been developed to mastery by the Assyrians. Typical Assyrian is the shield bearer with oversize shields protecting the masses of bowmen from enemy fire.  Set in ancient Mesopotamia, Assyrian Wars (722 to 605 BC) covers the ruler period of the last four great Assyrian Kings and the decline and fall period resulting in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the defeat of their Egyptian Allies.&#10;&#10;Assyrian Wars is a multi player, point to point game, but with the Assyrian player against all others. Temporary Alliance changes possible. Conflicting trade interests may cause minor conflicts.  It can, however, be played solitaire as well. Each game turn represents the ruler period of one Assyrian King, the last turn decline and fall. Turns are divided into impulses. Follow the order of states on the impulse track each card played represents an impulse. Every game is different for nobody knows which random cards a player gets in addition to his fixed home cards.&#10;&#10;Assyrian Wars allows detailed siege warfare. 66 cities on the map are waiting for you to take them.

There are elements here from backgammon, pachisi, Careers, you name it.&#10;&#10;The vague back story has players controlling &quot;agents&quot; that move about the board &quot;...in your struggle against the odds to obtain money, prisoners, and position&quot;.&#10;&#10;The square gameboard is printed with four concentric rings of spaces.  Each turn players roll two dice to move one of their three tokens - pardon me, &quot;agents&quot; - out of their headquarters on the outer ring and around the board.  Agents can be sent back to HQ by enemy agents, can form blockades, can fall into traps and be captured, and in general are used to make money and harass the other agents.&#10;&#10;Most squares are marked with actions that kick off when agents land on them.  Many of these earn money for the players, either as a flat payment or by allowing a simple form of gambling involving the bank and the other players.  Other actions include: allowing movement up to the next inner track, drawing &quot;Fate&quot; cards that dole out random goodness and badness, starting an auction that sells fallen agents to the highest bidders, and traps that may be inconveniently activated by other players.&#10;&#10;The rings get progressively more generous and dangerous as agents move to the inside.  Agents captured by an opponent's action (rather than a game mechanic) don't re-enter the game, so the number of agents in play gradually diminishes.  The game ends when only one player's agents are left on the board.  Players sell (ransom, I suppose) their captured prisoners, and the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;This appears to be a limited run home brew, but it comes in a sturdy box and the production values are good.
