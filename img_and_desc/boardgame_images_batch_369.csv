Players alternate picking from facedown tiles. If they can place a tile on their stack and create a word then they keep the tile, otherwise place it face up back in the draw pile.

A life-and-death struggle between single-celled organisms involves two players in a rapid action contest of dice and strategy. Each opponent attempts to inflict the foreign cell by exposing it to a carrier virus while defensively contracting its own cell wall and shifting its nucleus out of danger. As in life, fate is decided by aggression, instinct and luck.&#10;&#10;Description:&#10;&#10;In Infecta each player controls a cell made up of a nucleus piece and many cell wall pieces. Each player also controls six virions (virus particles) which can destroy other pieces; the object is to destroy the opponent's nucleus, all the opponent's virions, or all the opponent's cell walls.&#10;&#10;On a turn the active player rolls two dice and moves pieces accordingly. Virions can only move in straight lines, and each one must use the full amount rolled on one die. The other pieces can split dice and move in any combination of directions desired. Rolling doubles entitles a player to another turn (though this cannot be repeated) and also to restore a destroyed virion under certain conditions.&#10;&#10;"

Later in the game, if a player finds another pair of friends, he may only take a tile if it fits next to one already in front of him. If not, the player gives it to an adjacent player.

In the larger campaign game, the player takes the role of a ludus, the operator of a gladiatorial school. The ludus owned a number of slaves trained to fight as gladiators. These slaves and their trainers (often retired gladiators themselves) made up the familia gladiatorius of the ludus. Normally, the ludus was contracted by the editor to provide fighters for the murrus. It was a risky business, and its practitioners were reviled by Roman society. Yet fortunes could be made by providing a bloodthirsty populace with bloody entertainment.&#10;&#10;"
