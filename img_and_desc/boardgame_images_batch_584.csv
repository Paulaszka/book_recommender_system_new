A comparison is done using a chart on each card, and the magnetic football is moved on the board accordingly.&#10;&#10;For instance: It's 1st and 10 on the offensive players own 30 yard line. The offensive player chooses a passing play, and the defensive player chooses a run defense. The chart on the card indicates that the play results in a turnover. Now, the players change decks, and assume the other role.&#10;&#10;"

That said, the game differs in a number of ways from Mr. Jack. In more detail...&#10;&#10;In Le Fant&ocirc;me de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, eight suspect tokens stand in the ten rooms of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier. Each suspect has a reason to drive the opera singer La Carlotta away from the production, and at the start of the game one of the suspects is randomly determined to be the true identity of the Phantom player. The other player is the Investigator, and he wants to discover the Phantom's identity; if he does so before La Carlotta flees the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, then he wins. Otherwise, he loses. (To balance play between newcomers and experienced players La Carlotta's starting position can changed.)&#10;&#10;At the start of each odd round, eight suspect cards are shuffled and four of them revealed. The Investigator moves one suspect and (likely) uses this suspect's unique ability, then the Phantom moves two of the remaining three suspects, then the Investigator moves the final suspect. The Phantom player then reveals whether he can or cannot cause a disturbance in the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, thus scaring La Carlotta; he can cause a disturbance only if he's alone or if he's in the room with the blackout token. If he can cause a disturbance, the Investigator clears all suspects sharing a lit room; if not, the Investigator clears all suspects in the dark or on their own. After this, La Carlotta moves one step closer to fleeing for each suspect that hasn't been declared innocent (and an additional step if the Phantom did create a disturbance).&#10;&#10;For each even round, the remaining four suspect cards are revealed, and the players again move characters and use their special abilities, with the Phantom going first. The game continues until only a single suspect is not innocent or La Carlotta flees France for the safety of Milan.&#10;&#10;When a character moves, it can move up to as many spaces as the number of characters in the room from which it moves. Most characters can move only through open corridors, but Meg Giry can use secret passageways that connect many of the rooms. The players must use Meg's ability and the other characters' special abilities to hide or reveal information. One character, for example, moves a padlock that blocks one corridor, while another is responsible for the roaming blackout that allows the Phantom to operate in darkness (or at least provide cover for his activity elsewhere). One sweet character can draw everyone from adjacent rooms to her side, while an unpleasant fellow can drive everyone away. Still another reveals (or hides) an alibi card, clearing one suspect (or keeping his true nature unknown). Every character is useful in the right situation. You just have to learn what those situations are...&#10;&#10;"

In the game, the players take on the roles of commanding forces on opposite sides of the conflict.&#10;&#10;One player leads the extraterrestrial conquerors whose goal is to transform the Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. The Invaders possess unthinkable weapons and unknowable technologies. More so, within their galactic armada the aliens hold bound a terrifying array of eldritch creatures engineered specifically to sow the chaos and destruction that heralds the arrival of their masters.&#10;&#10;The other player commands the unyielding forces of a united Earth. In the shadow of a planet-wide scourge, the nations of the Earth have joined forces to confront the arrival of a doom spawned on the other side of the galaxy. The Terran alliance is a desperation-forged bulwark upon which the invading forces crash and are repelled time and again. Outgunned, with salvaged or untested technology and one foot in the grave, the determined network of military machinery, elite strike-teams, warfare scientists, and neighborhood militias are surprisingly capable of bloodying the Invaders' noses whenever the two forces meet.&#10;&#10;The eponymous Invaders seek to destroy the forces defending the Earth and exhaust their reserves. They do this by defeating the defending forces at key locations while also causing the Earth player to disrupt cards from their deck to their discard pile. The Invader must be cunning when deploying their creatures and war-machines, or enacting their schemes, as the cost to bring assets into the war often involves the discarding of other assets.&#10;&#10;Mankind must work desperately to defend critical resources and locations from the corruption and incursion of the alien threat. They do this by building formidable and deadly defenses, predicting where the alien player will strike and setting traps designed to deprive the Invaders of key units and wear-down their options. Like the Invader, the humans need to be clever in what they deploy and how they deploy it because their heroes may be bold but they are small in number, and the Invaders are inexorable.&#10;&#10;Invaders is a science-fiction game piled thick with the trappings of war and horror. It is steeped in difficult decisions, but built upon a simple, elegant set of rules, and because of this, you will find each game telling a slightly different story each time you play. Both sides use cards to represent their units, plans, resources and events, but as this is an asymmetrical battle game, the way in which those cards are played and how they forward their owner's goals are very different. Regardless, knowing when to let an asset go in favor of a better one, how to exploit a weakness in your enemy's ranks, and where to press an advantage or feint a trap will be key in seeing your side emerge as the victor from the morass of galactic war.&#10;&#10;One question remains: Which side are YOU on?&#10;&#10;"

Neither version will require constant external chart look ups or other methods that can slow down a game&rsquo;s pace. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets all of the action comes from each team&rsquo;s rating sheet.&#10;&#10;Let me stress that this is NOT a quick play game. All action is resolved possession-by-possession, just as in real basketball. With the simplified method, you are tracking only the team&rsquo;s score and fouls which allows for quicker game times. However, you&rsquo;ll still visually see why a team wins or loses. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets each team&rsquo;s card is formulated to accurately replicate all aspects of a team&rsquo;s play. Each team is rated offensively for field goal percentage, three point shooting, propensity to commit turnovers, ability to get open shots, propensity to commit offensive fouls, free throw shooting, offensive rebounding, and ability to hit contested shots. On the defensive side, each team is rated for their ability to contest shots, propensity to commit fouls, ability to force turnovers, defensive rebounding ability, and two point and three point field goal percentage allowed.&#10;&#10;Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets also features a unique Power System that incorporates strength of schedule as well as home court advantage. With the Power System you can accurately match-up power house teams against the cupcakes and be assured that the results will mirror real life.&#10;&#10;The advanced game features all of the above, but also brings individual players into the mix. Every player for every team is accurately rated to perform as they did in the college basketball season. Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets features a unique system that doesn&rsquo;t require manual substitutions on the part of the gamer. This system means that you don&rsquo;t have to track player minutes or other minutia for realistic performances. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets every player will perform as they did during the college season. You&rsquo;ll have nights where your starters are &ldquo;off&rdquo; and nights where a bench player provides a spark, leading your team to victory.&#10;&#10;And while the substitutions are handled within the game engine, don&rsquo;t think that coaching decisions were left out. As the coach, you decide when to implement the full-court press. You&rsquo;ll decide when to &ldquo;sag&rdquo; to stop the opponent&rsquo;s inside game or stretch your defense to pressure the perimeter shooters. On offense you decide the pace in which your team plays. Do you fast break, or use the entire clock to limit the opponent&rsquo;s possessions? Best of all, each coaching option is just that, and option. If you have designs on being the next great college coach, you can implement them all. If you prefer to watch the game unfold, you can implement none. Either way you&rsquo;ll still end up with realistic results!&#10;&#10;Take the court today and see if you can guide your favorite team to the ultimate goal of Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets!&#10;&#10;"

The rest of the players play Hero&rsquo;s foes, fight a round of combat, and then the next player plays his Hero. Hence, only one player is playing a Hero at a time while the rest play his foes. If a player is playing Hero&rsquo;s foes, their Hero is currently inactive and doesn&rsquo;t factor into play. The Hero wins renown points by defeating his enemies. There are various victory conditions (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Hero, or the last player with cards left to play wins the game).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one Hero card, a foe deck and a draw deck. Players randomly decide who will go first. That player becomes the active player, and places his Hero card in the center of the table and is considered to be playing the Hero. All players then draw cards form their draw deck and play begins. The Hero player then can place into play any allies and locations that he or she might have and also place items and weapons on his Hero card for use them in the upcoming combat. Whether or not cards can be placed into play depends on several factors, but the main mechanic for both foes and the Hero is their pool of prowess points. Most cards have a prowess cost that gets subtracted from this pool in order to place a card into play.&#10;&#10;Then the foes draw from their foe deck a number of cards partly based upon how many much renown the Hero has. For every foe the Hero kills, that player places that foes card into the area known as the chronicle. Each foe has a renown score, and the total of all the felled&rsquo; foes renown score in Conan&rsquo;s chronicle is his renown score.&#10;&#10;The more defeated foes in a Hero's chronicle, the more foes the opposing player gets to put into play, i.e. the more famous the Hero gets, the more enemies want to take him down. Once the foe pool is drawn, the foe players then decide which of these foe cards they want to put into play. There are major and minor foes and rules governing how many foes from the foe draw can be put into play. Once the foes decide which of their foe cards they are able and want to play, they place their foe cards into 4 zones around the Hero(front, left, right and rear). They then place &ldquo;move&rdquo; cards from their draw deck for each foe they have assigned to do battle with the Hero. These cards are placed face down and represent both offensive and defensive elements. The Hero player then responds to these move cards with his own move cards, placed face up, to counter each foes&rsquo; move card. Hero&rsquo;s move cards also incorporate both offensive and defensive elements. The foes then reveal their move cards and combat is resolved. If any of the foes are left alive, all players draw cards from their draw deck, and the surviving foes place new move cards onto the table. The Hero once again counters, combat is resolved, etc. until either the Hero retreats or defeats all his foes. If the Hero retreats he loses renown. If he defeats all of his foes, the Hero then can decide to rest and replenish his prowess pool and a small fraction of his life points. The Hero can also &ldquo;press on.&rdquo; If the Hero presses on, he starts a new round of combat, but does not get to replenish any prowess or life. Once the Hero rests or retreats, the next player then becomes the Hero.&#10;&#10;Play continues until a victory condition is met (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Conan, or the last player with cards left to play).&#10;&#10;Each player must provide two decks which meet the appropriate requirements. The Draw Deck must contain at least 40 non-foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given card are allowed, with no more than 1 copy of any unique card. The Foe Deck must contain at least 25 foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given foe card (or 1 copy of any unique card) are permitted.

But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be.

Can they drive the wolf away &ndash; or will they all be eaten?&#10;&#10;In Eat Me, If You Can, the wolf player tries to eat one of the other players to score points while the players, being prey, score by trapping the wolf. In each round, one player is the wolf and the other players are given Little Red Riding Hood (worth 3 points), Mother Pig (2 points), or a little piggy (1 point). Each non-wolf player then secretly chooses one of two cards in hand: Will the player sleep and rest, hoping not to be disturbed by the wolf? Or will the player set up a trap, thinking that the wolf will be coming for her? Once the players lay down their cards, the wolf chooses one of the players. If this player went to sleep, the wolf takes points from this player equal to the value of her character; if she set up a trap, on the other hand, she takes points from the wolf. Everyone else who rested this round scores points from the bank for their character &mdash; but only if they got their beauty sleep!&#10;&#10;Whoever lost points that round becomes the wolf for the next round and hands out the character cards to players as she wishes. As soon as a player has ten or more points, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Each player is trying to hack into the same node by controlling the most ports. Only one hacker comes out on top.&#10;&#10;Hackers take control of ports by placing the most packets on them. They can also play a firewall on a port to block all other players from playing on that port. If a player is restricted by a opponent's firewall they may place a backdoor next to it to also be able to play on that port. Crafty hackers can also use spikes to their advantage by removing a die from the game. If a player manages to play a second firewall of their color then that port is locked down and no player may play anything on it (including spikes).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with ten dice. At the beginning of the game the first player rolls to see how many ports there will be (from 2-4). Next the first player rolls 2 dice and places one on an open port. The next player rolls 3 dice and places one on the board. Play continues with each player rolling 3 dice and placing one until all players are out of dice or all ports are locked down.&#10;&#10;The player with the most ports controlled wins. If there is a tie for ports controlled then the tied players count their total number of packets on their controlled ports. Whoever has the most packets wins.&#10;&#10;

The game design is meant to be simple and highly playable, yet one that portrays the historical challenges facing the combatants. Historically the US failed to bottle up the Spanish fleet, and was forced to undergo a lengthy blockade while the US Army fought the Spanish garrison for control of the city and port. The capture of key fortifications and the heights at Kettle and San Juan Hills compelled Admiral Pascual Cervera to sortie on July 3rd to prevent his ships from being sunk at their moorings by US artillery, or capture when the town surrendered. The US navy would sink all of the fleeing Spanish ships with little loss, scoring a lop-sided win.&#10;&#10;Each copy of Death Before Dishonor is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    One sheet of 61 single-sided counters.&#10;&bull;    One 8.5 by 11 map.&#10;&bull;    This set of rules.&#10;&#10;Players will also need a one ten-sided die (D10).&#10;&#10;"

Will your friend choose Outer Space, or The Bottom of the Sea? Do they prefer the Window or the Aisle? Are they all about the Party, or the After-Party? Successfully predict how your friends will answer weighty questions like these in Choose One! and you'll advance your token to the finish line!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has 2 voting cards (blue/white). Deal everyone 5 random choice cards, which have a blue choice and a white choice. Players take turns being the Chooser, who:&#10;- plays a Choice card face up (we played that they also select and play their answer card, face down)&#10;- everyone else guesses whether the Chooser would pick blue or white, and plays that card&#10;- reveal all answer cards and compare with Chooser's. If:&#10;... no one matches, Chooser scores 2VP&#10;... at least one player matches and another doesn't, Chooser and all matches score 1VP&#10;... everyone matches, 0VP scored&#10;- at end of your Chooser turn, may discard as many of your answers as desired; draw back up to 5-card hand size&#10;&#10;Play continues until someone gets 11VP to win. If tied, continue playing till only one player is leading = winner.&#10;&#10;"

The words you chose are based on certain criteria established by a roll of the Game Mode die, which includes 6 different game modes: Starts With, Ends With, Dual Rune, Rhymes With, Relation, and Weak Link. The first three modes are letter-based, and decided on the roll of a D20 letter die. The last three modes are word-based, and decided on the flip of a Word Card. Only 4-letter words are allowed (no plurals), and only unique words earn you a point (ie. if another player has the same word as you, neither of you earn a point for that word). First player to 44 points wins.&#10;&#10;The game has unique custom packaging, in an engraved wooden box that measures on 3.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; (just a bit bigger than an index card!), and has a wood-and-glass timer, and wooden and bone-colored dice to keep with the old-world runic theme.&#10;&#10;"
