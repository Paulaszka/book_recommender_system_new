A big success in the '80s, a game who introduced a lot of people in the hobby.&#10;Some people say that the game is unbalanced (I'm afraid it's true), expecially in the 2-player game, when it's not possible to form alliances.

2038,,"Coming in a very awkward-sized box (42 x 42 x 3 cm), this is a distant relative of Scrabble. The 19x19 board is colored in two distinct areas, the central lozenge (just reaching the edges) being called the arena. The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.&#10;&#10;Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.&#10;&#10;Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.&#10;&#10;The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:&#10;&#10;The Eye (covers 1 square);&#10;    The Rod (covers 2 squares);&#10;    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);&#10;    The Snake (covers 4 squares);&#10;    The Door (covers 5 squares);&#10;    The Gun (covers 6 squares).&#10;&#10;"

On the board are placed, in a pre-movement round, tiles with three arrows which point to three of the eight surrounding spaces. Each player plays these tiles alternatively until they have all been played. Movement is made by following the arrows, and avoiding the neutral zone in the middle. The game ends when one player reaches his goal or when both players cannot make legal moves.&#10;&#10;The key game mechanism is that your move options are determined not by the three arrows on the tile under your (transparent) game piece, but by those under your opponent's piece. Thus, each move is chosen to try and limit your opponent's next as well as to try and guarantee yourself a good selection of choices. This adds an element of bluff and second-guessing to the game.&#10;&#10;The rules also include some variations to the two-player game that make the game easier or harder to finish.&#10;&#10;"

Your cue ball may travel any distance in a straight line before hitting a neutral (or another cue ball); at that moment, its momentum is transferred and the ball hit moves the same distance.

2061,,"This is a game detailing the Persian Gulf War fought in the early 1990's. Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.&#10;&#10;Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!&#10;&#10;Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.&#10;&#10;Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.&#10;&#10;All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.&#10;&#10;A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.&#10;&#10;"

The higher the hand, the greater the score. The poker hands interlock in the same way as the words on a scrabble board, so it`s possible to score for more than one hand on a turn. When a player scores, he/she takes score chips from the box. the player with the highest scoring number of chips when the cards run out is the winner.&#10;Simple, fast and fairly enjoyable; but very lightweight. An opener/closer.&#10;&#10;The bits: One board, comprising an 11x11 grid. most of the spaces are blank, but some have representations of playing cards on them; these are bonus squares, a la scrabble.&#10;&#10;56 &quot;playing cards&quot;. These are actually good quality cardboard tiles.&#10;&#10;30 No Entry tiles.&#10;&#10;4 playing racks&#10;&#10;Poker chips in various denominations&#10;&#10;Each player starts with chips worth 150 and 7 tiles. These are placed in the playing rack.&#10;the four joker tiles are laid on the Joker squres on the board.&#10;&#10;Players must, on their turn lay at least one card on the board to form a legitimate poker hand, or failing that change one or more tiles at a cost of 10 per tile.&#10;&#10;Tiles laid must extend hands already played, again in the same way as scrabble. &#10;Players do not have to lay five cards at a time. For example, a player could form four of a kind simply by laying three tiles of the same denomination next to a previous tile with that denomination.&#10;&#10;bonuses are scored by laying tiles on the special bonus squares on the board. Again, these squares have representations of playing cards on them and in order to score, you must lay the tile of the same denomination as the bonus square in order to score.&#10;When a five card poker hand has been formed on the board, it can no longer be extended, so a No Entry tile must be laid at either end of the hand to stop any further tiles from being added.&#10;If a hand is played so it covers a Joker tile, this tile is taken up and added to the players` hand.&#10;If a Joker is laid as part of a hand, it may be replaced with the correct tile which it represents on a later turn.&#10;When a player lays a hand down, he/she takes poker chips to the value of the hand. This varies from 10 for a pair, to 1000 for a royal flush.&#10;When the cards run out, scores are totted up and the player with the highest value in chips is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
2063,,"The Great Khan Game includes one 32-page rule book, one 11&quot; x 17&quot; full-color map of the Whamite Isles, 120 die-cut cardboard playing pieces, 162 playing cards, and one plastic storage bag.&#10;&#10;This is a card/strategy board game for 2 or more players.  The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.&#10;&#10;The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.&#10;&#10;The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.&#10;&#10;Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.&#10;&#10;The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.&#10;&#10;It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.&#10;&#10;"

There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.&#10;&#10;According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.&#10;&#10;"

When you come upon one you place a peg with that letter into your block. Anytime you land on a card you turn it over. You can move through cards that are letters that you have in your block.  You can pick up a devil peg voluntarily by landing on the Devil space in the middle of the board or have one forced on you by landing on a devil card.  Devil pegs allow you movement bonuses and allow you to land on an opponent.  You then give the opponent your devil peg and if you receive 2 they fly away taking two letter pegs with them.&#10;&#10;Winner is the person who collects 6 letter pegs while having no Devil pegs.&#10;&#10;"

It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).&#10;&#10;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.&#10;&#10;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.&#10;&#10;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.&#10;&#10;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.

The mine was so prosperous, in fact, that the troll had accumulated enough wealth to retire after years of hard work.&#10;Once a year, the elves who live in the forests near the mine celebrate their Great Wood Fair. One of the highlights of each Fair is the mining competition. The troll, who enjoys the Fair just as much as the elves, gladly opens up the mine to let the elves dig for gold. Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig. In the end, it is the most clever elf who will win and stake a claim to his gold.&#10;&#10;This is an simple bluffing game from the White Wind stable. Players spend money to buy shovels &amp; pickaxes to dig for gold. They then enter the mine, and start to dig. But wait!! players also get to place broken shovel and decoy counters on the board as well. A broken shovel means no gold, and you lose the implement you were digging with. All decoys (or no counters) means you get the gold value on the board space you're digging from. The question is - to dig or not to dig??&#10;&#10;The winner is the first to 50 gold, or the highest gold when someone with 50 gold gets out of the mine.&#10;&#10;"

It is a part of the same series or games as Cabale and Siesta.  Players begin with four hidden tiles that have pictures on them matching block types (in two shapes and two colors).  Players take turns adding and possibly moving blocks on a board, each turn adding to one of six towers, to a maximum or four blocks per tower.  The players are trying to build towers with pieces that match their tiles.  When five towers reach their maximum height, players arrange their tiles so as to match as many towers and blocks as possible.&#10;&#10;"

What makes this game different is there are two areas to fight/control and the artwork on the cards.&#10;&#10;The story, Heaven has fallen and the Angels trapped on Earth are trying to use the Matrix (internet) to open a gateway into Heaven.&#10;&#10;There are six basic types of cards.&#10;&#10;Locations (lands) that open (tap) to provide aura (mana) or store tau (victory points.) There are 8 different convictions (colors) so from a starter it will still be near impossible to build a deck.&#10;&#10;Characters (creatures) represent the fallen hosts and heathen groups that can be called. These can battle in the Wilds (real world) or plug in and leave their body and fight in the Matrix. While there, if they die they're ripped back into their body.&#10;&#10;Alephs (artifacts) are powerful talismans that attach to characters or locations.&#10;&#10;Enhancements (enchantments) attach to other cards for positive or negative affects.&#10;&#10;Celestial Powers (sorceries) can be played on your turn only and are discarded immediately.&#10;&#10;Miracles (instants) are instant effects that can be played anytime.&#10;&#10;To win the game you need to play cards in the Matrix that can store tau and protect them. Each card can only hold so much, so you will need to call more then one. You will need to store enough tau (5 to 21 depending on the number of players and desired game length) to open a gateway into heaven.&#10;&#10;The game is a bit more complicated than Magic but with fewer cards available not as rich. There is also a social voting element similar to V:tES/Jyhad.  Special mention must be made of the cards. The cards are about an inch longer than most ccgs, with most of the extra room taken up by the stunning artwork. Kudos to Rick Berry, the graphic designer, for making one of the most striking looking games out there.&#10;&#10;"

2101,,"Orbit War was a magazine game published by Steve Jackson Games in Space Gamer (Issue 66 - Nov 1983). This release was followed by an expansion published in Space Gamer (Issue 67 - Jan 1984) and later by the boxed edition.&#10;&#10;It is a simulation of satellite warfare in low Earth orbit. The players are the USA and the APU (Asian-Polish Union). The object is of course to destroy your opponent's satellites and such...&#10;&#10;The author wrote: &quot;I had planned a Strategic Orbit War game where the goal is for players to explore, colonize, and mine the solar system. So I envisioned one big map showing the planets orbiting around, then a bunch of little maps showing the players' satellites orbiting the different planets, trying to blow the other guy's satellites out of orbit so they can claim the natural resources of that planet for themselves. Alas, with Orbit War failing, Strategic Orbit War never came to pass either.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

In turn, players roll a colored die, then offer at least one face-down money card to the player indicated by the roll. That player may either accept the offer or challenge it. After challenging the offer, the player rolls a numbered die. If the number is greater than the amount of money offered, the offering player must add at least one face-down card to the mix and begin the process anew. If the die roll is equal to the money, the offer must be accepted. If the roll is less than the offer, the offering player keeps his money and the challenging player must pay the offering player the amount offered.

An octopus card when revealed also will end the turn and cost the player the other cards turned up on that turn, but allows the player to attempt to steal cards from another player's score pile. Only the biggest fish of a type in a player's pile count for scoring purposes.
