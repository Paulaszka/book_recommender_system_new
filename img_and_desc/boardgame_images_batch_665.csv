At the beginning of each round, if a player controls provinces in at least four regions, they reveal the next card in their stack and select one of the bonuses depicted on it. These bonuses include war chests, armies placed directly into the tower tray, rice and victory points.&#10;&#10;With Military Leaders, every player is given one military leader figure to place on one of their controlled provinces. A player's leader provides extra benefits for performing actions in their province, such as reducing the cost for buildings or providing extra resources when collecting rice or taxes. At the end of a player's turn, they move their leader to an adjacent province they control and leave a marker at the old location - if they don't control any provinces adjacent to where their leader is, they move their leader to any of their controlled provinces without leaving a marker behind. The more markers a player has on the board at the end of the game, the more points will be awarded!&#10;&#10;For Chambers, many offices have to be taken in order to rule the land. At the beginning of each round, six chamber markers are revealed and placed on the corresponding spaces on the chamber tableau, representing available offices that can be filled by the players. Whoever controls the most provinces in each region can fill the position by exchanging the chamber marker on the tableau with one of their own player markers. At the end of the game, players are awarded extra points for majorities in horizontal and vertical lines on the chamber tableau.&#10;&#10;"

Players are dealt three cards each, and three more cards are placed face-down on the table. Starting with the player who's most recently had Chikuwa, each player may swap two cards from their hand with those on the table, or they may pass. Going clockwise, once each player has had their turn, the cards on the table are shuffled back into the deck, and another three are dealt face-down. Going back the other way, the players repeat their turn to swap one or two cards in their hand. Lastly, everyone shows their hand.&#10;&#10;The aim is to get the best ranking combination of three cards. In the game, 3-3-3 is the worst of all, since you have been a greedy cat and stuffed yourself until you've got stomach-ache. 0-0-0 is the best combination, since the owners see you've been so unselfish and punish the other cats by giving you their food. But after 0-0-0, the best combo is 3-3-2, then 3-2-2, then 3-3-1 and so on, down to 1-0-0 which beats 3-3-3.

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!&#10;&#10;To this basic game, Ocean Labyrinth adds an underwater theme and a twist: some tiles have special rules on their backsides. When a tile of this  type is pushed out, a special rule is used for the next turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Pufferfish: the current player is so scared from this fish that they lose their movement for the current turn.&#10;    Diving scooter: you move more quickly: take an additional turn&#10;    Oxygen tank: you don't have enough oxygen, so you must return your pawn to a freely chosen start tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Afterwards, she will give you some excercises to learn about the human body. &#10;F.e. you'll have to find the listed tooth or you have to represent a certain feeling which the other players will have to guess. Each time, you'll be doing other excercises and you'll get 1 or 2 points, depending on how good you did this game. Sometimes you'll be doing these tests by yourself, other things should be done by all players.

No luck of the draw here, it's entirely up to you! Get as many enjoyment points as possible and win the game! Be clever and anticipate what the others will do so that you can claim victory. Each player will target another cat and a location where a bird is hanging out. They will then select their actions for the 2 rounds of action. All of the cards are revealed simultaneously, they get resolved and when the smoke clears, some cats may have birds and some may not.&#10;&#10;The birds will hang out at the bird bath, in the grass, on the fence or in the trees. The bigger birds will need to be stalked before catching them and you will have to time everything just right. Once you do catch your bird you will have a choice to either press your luck and play with the bird to double its enjoyment point value or to just eat it. The longer you play with it the greater the chance of it being stolen by another cat.&#10;&#10;Taunt cards allow other cats to distract you and cancel your actions, nothing is safe in this back yard!&#10;&#10;"

Movement is based on the flip of the coin... one move for heads, two moves for tails. Players move along a winding pathway (hence the &quot;wind&quot; in the title) and attempt to locate (the &quot;find&quot; in the title) items related to summer vacation. For example, a player could land on a space requiring the kid to locate four flip-flop sandals. Other spaces require a child to discover the subtle differences between two nearly identical images.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the end of the pathway is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

At night the Informants reveal themselves to one another &mdash; assuming any exist, that is, as at all player counts between zero and three Informants are in play &mdash; then all players complete their specialist action in a clockwise order (removing the need for a rigid script/app and reducing the potential to accidentally reveal your role). Specialist actions include gathering information, switching roles, and helping players in their attempt to identify the Informant(s) before the day is over. If a majority of players identify an Informant, the Rebels wins &mdash; but if the Informant(s) remain hidden, they win!&#10;&#10;"
