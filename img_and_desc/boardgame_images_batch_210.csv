The game board has locations for each player to store cards, an area to build the card pyramids central to game play, a draw pile area (the Oasis) and a discard pile area (the Sphinx).&#10;&#10;The game begins by taking 25 cards and using them to build two overlapping pyramids in the center of the game board.

Cards for &quot;tricks&quot; may come from the player's personal storage area (which may hold up to 3 cards), the top of the Sphinx pile, or uncovered cards in the pyramid structure.  A player's turn ends when he takes the drawn card and either makes a trick with it, places it in storage, discards it to the Sphinx, or exchanges it with a card already in storage and discards that card to the Sphinx.&#10;&#10;When all of the cards from the Oasis have been drawn and played, the hand ends and players score points for: the Last Royal Trick (last trick played that contains a Queen, Pharaoh, or Camel) for 1 point, Pyramids (clearing the last card from the pyramids) for i point, Majority (most tricks captured) for 2 points, Scarabs (most Scarab suit cards captured) for 2 points, and Camels at 1 point per captured Camel.

When a NOT-IT card is turned over, nothing happens.&#10;&#10;When a YOU'RE IT card is turned over, it will have one of 4 commands: LOWEST IS IT, HIGHEST IS IT, REDDEST IS IT or WHITEST IS IT. At this point players race to reach the cube that is the opposite of the card.&#10;&#10;Example: LOWEST IS IT, players will try to grab the highest number cube so they are not it. But wait, some of the cards say LOWEST IS NOT IT in this case players would try to grab the cube with the lowest number.&#10;&#10;The player that ends up &quot;IT&quot; will start flipping the cards.&#10;&#10;When a YOU'RE OUT card is turned over, the player who is &quot;IT&quot;, is eliminated and the rest of the players race to see who will be &quot;IT&quot; next.&#10;&#10;Be the last player standing and receive a &quot;Winner Chip&quot;.

In RFL, players take on the role of a franchise manager and coach.  The players will draft rookies, sign free agents, manage franchise finances and try to make a run at the league championship, all at the same time!  Rogue Football League runs over the course of three seasons, so owners will have plenty of time to see their league grow and succeed.&#10;&#10;What makes RFL fun to play is that while players are trying to beat each other on the field, they must work together for the success of the league off the field, or no one wins.&#10;&#10;It is not necessary to have eight players to play RFL.  While the game has mechanics for non-player franchises, and can even be played solitaire, interaction is a BIG part of the game.&#10;&#10;League models, or templates, are available for leagues of between six and twelve teams. Each individual game on the schedule can be resolved in 3-5 minutes with the two owners rolling against each other, or a quick play function is available if owners wish to concentrate on the managerial/financial aspects of the league.&#10;&#10;Rogue Football League comes with a 14-page rulebook, 24 franchise cards, 52 veteran cards, 44 rookie cards, 60 event cards, originals of all necessary game forms, and three double-sided player aid cards.&#10;&#10;     Two expansions have been released: Foreign Fields, which adds in more league templates, more cards and rules for Canadian/European franchises; and Ghosts of the Past, which adds in more cards, a random event table and scenarios for recreating the USFL, WFL, and WLAF&#10; Available from Brothers-in-Arms Games at biagamesonline.tripod.com - check out the site and check out the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each of 3 to 5 players represents a clan (Wolf, Bear, Turtle, Eagle, or Deer) within the Iroquois Confederation during this time and attempts to gain control of Confederation policy and the beaver trade.&quot;&#10;&#10;There are two main elements that players must deal with - influencing the five nations to follow your clan and attacking the enemy tribes.&#10;&#10;Each nation grants a different benefit when it follows your leadership. Control of a nation is determined with an area control/influence mechanism.  If one is willing to surrender their influence during a council turn, more beaver tokens (victory points) are earned.&#10;&#10;When attacking neighboring tribes, other clans may join yours in the attack.  Their help will improve the chances of victory, but means the spoils will be shared.  Success is determined by a simple superiority of numbers after the defending tribe has had a chance to eliminate the attackers.  Success earns the survivors a share of that tribe's beaver furs.&#10;&#10;"

The results of a roll table indicate whether you must try to use all the blocks left in the kitty, or only one block. Often, the result of the roll indicates the shape of a block that you must place on top of the tower. Completing the tower grants you 15 points, causing the tower to collapse on your turn grants all the other players points equal to the number of blocks left in the kitty. There is an exception: if you fail in your attempt to place the very last block atop the tower, each other player gets 15 points. The game is played to a 50 point total.&#10;&#10;The year, 1972, is a guess, as the game is unmarked.

Only one ship is allowed per space and each ship can move up to 3 spaces in any direction. You can then attack single enemy ships with 1 to 3 ships of your own at a time. The defender rolls one die and the attacker rolls as many dice as ships used in the attack. Whoever rolls the single highest die removes one enemy ship involved in the fight. Ties result in no losses.

The other main rule is that you MUST get your cube of a color off the board before you get the matching cylinder off the board.&#10;&#10;The ability to jump other pieces and move either type of piece, the fact that no one &quot;owns&quot; pieces until they remove them from the board makes for a depth of strategy seen in very few games.&#10;&#10;When you add the fact that there is no set starting position for the playing pieces, you will soon see that this game is almost &quot;Bottomless&quot; which gives it the ability to be studied and played for years, if not decades before anyone will ever figure out if there is an optimal setup&#10;&#10;"
