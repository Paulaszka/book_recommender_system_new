Includes a new fast and easy to learn ruleset with lots of rule and game play examples.&#10;&#10;Badlands Rally uses D6 dice to resolve both opposed and unopposed actions. Each model, called a Gear, has a number of Attributes that distinguish its own special characteristics and advantages in the game. Players must choose what combination of attack, special movement or other actions will lead them to victory. Dice mechanics allow for quick resolution of these actions through simple rolls of varying numbers of dice depending on the modifiers that apply. All modifiers either add dice to a roll or subtract them. There are two kinds of roll: A Roll and a Check.  A Roll is an unopposed test which uses a simple comparison of dice to an Attribute for a number of successes.  A Check is an opposed test between players that uses the high dice in a roll and adds a bonus based on the other dice compared to an Attribute. In each lap of a game a Gear may resolve between four and six actions depending on player choices. A standard match is 2-3 laps.  Variable Gear upgrades, Gear choices, and Scenarios allow for an almost infinite variety of game conditions. Additional Gear data cards are provided that allow player to use almost the entire Heavy Gear line of miniatures from Dream Pod 9 to add even more variety to their games. Up to Eight Gears can race at once with two to four players being the norm.&#10; The box set includes rules booklet, full color hex map, 4 easy to assemble racing gear miniatures of the Rally Viper, Rally Pitbull, Rally Jerboa and Rally Ferret cast in pewter with plastic hex bases, 8 double-sided datacards (Rally Viper/Viper II, Rally Pitbull/Pitbull II, Rally Jerboa/Jerboa II, Rally Ferret/Ferret II, Rally Grizzly/Mamba, Rally Cobra/Chasseur MkII, Rally Sapeur/Iguana, and Rally Hunter/Dart Jager), assorted counters (rattled tracker gears, rattled, rally, damage, and upgrades) , 2 double-sided quick reference cards (rules and weapons/upgrades), and 6 dice.

Raicer&rsquo;s popular and critically acclaimed Clash of Giants WWI series to two of the storied battles of the American Civil War: Second Bull Run and Gettysburg. CoG: Civil War uses a modified version of the chit-pull Activation system of Clash of Giants II: Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914, while retaining the CoG combat system. Every (mostly brigade-level) unit has a Tactical Efficiency Rating based on its morale, training, leadership, and experience, but even a poor unit can have a heroic moment, while the Iron Brigade might not always be made of iron. It is a true player&rsquo;s system, which produces realistic results without a lot of fiddly procedures, and allows players to concentrate on the game rather than the rules.&#10; Units in CoG: Civil War are mostly infantry brigades, (with the odd cavalry brigade or demi-brigade).  Each day is divided into four day turns and one night turn. The maps depict woods, hills, steep hexsides, railway cuts and embankments, roads, rivers, creeks, bridges, towns, marshy ground, and the Devil&rsquo;s Den at Gettysburg.&#10; The Activation rules, which combines random formation activation (mostly corps for the Union and divisions for the Confederates) with variable movement allowances, creates the fog of war and friction so important to Civil War battles. Ordering your corps commander to take a hill is one thing-getting him to act as you wish is another. And because these effects are achieved without hidden counter/dummy unit mechanics, CoG: Civil War is not only a fast-paced two-player game, but excellent as well for solo play.  Some Activation markers also allow you to coordinate more than one formation, such as Longstreet at Gettysburg. But don&rsquo;t expect Old Pete to do so early in the day!&#10;&#10;One thing that speeds play in CoG: Civil War is the unusual treatment of artillery. There are no artillery units depicted; instead artillery appears as Combat Support Markers which are added (attacker first) to the combat strength of engaged units. Artillery CSMs are generally assigned to a specific division or corps, though army reserve artillery can be used to support any units. Artillery cannot be used in combat in certain terrain (woods or town hexes), but there are no line of sight considerations to slow down play or complicate the rules. Instead both line of sight and enemy counter-battery fire are handled with an elegant abstraction: each turn all available artillery CSMs of both sides go into a cup, and then half are randomly drawn. Whatever comes out of the cup is available for use that turn, so the player with more artillery on the field is more likely to get artillery support. This also allows a simple way to model the effectiveness of the Union Artillery Reserve at Gettysburg; once arrived, these markers never go in the cup, and are always available for use. Overall, CoG: Civil War&rsquo;s portrait of artillery as an occasionally decisive but definitely secondary arm is arguabley more realistic than many more complicated designs.&#10; The two battles, Second Bull Run and Gettysburg, depict one of Lee&rsquo;s greatest victories, prior to his first invasion of the north, and his greatest defeat during his second invasion. Both are meeting engagements, with limited forces deployed at the start, gradually building to mighty clashes. The arrival of fresh forces is another area where the game system allows variability: units may be delayed or arrive at the wrong road.

Players will have to judge trading losses for taking or holding tactically important ground.&#10;&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as General Pope&rsquo;s confused and confusing orders at Second Bull Run, the Confederate grand battery on the third day at Gettysburg, the use of the Union VI Corps as a reserve in both battles, cavalry delaying actions and retreat before combat, rallying units at night, and the actions of certain key leaders. But though there is enough chrome to give each battle a distinctive flavor, the action remains uncluttered, quick-playing, and  exciting.&#10; Not simply &ldquo;another Civil War battle system,&rdquo; CoG: Civil War presents a fresh new look at an oft-game topic. Giving each side a chance to change history in an afternoon&rsquo;s gaming, the use of the Clash of Giants system also shows the sometimes surprising links between the battles of the Civil War and the opening battles of the Great War 50 years later.  Fans of either the Civil War or the Clash of Giants series will not be disappointed.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;What's notable here is the use of two activator pieces based on an a notion created by designer Joe Joyce, as per the contest mentioned above. This allows captured pieces to be removed from play, converted to immobile neutral pieces or replaced by a piece of one's own color, depending on how they are captured.&#10;&#10;"

If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making.

A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;After combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger! If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader, Phantom Leader or Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Tiger Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every commander to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;"

Where the Russian Front of World War II beckons, and then taking the action to the African Front, and then the French Front, game designer Carl Paradis presents the fourth chapter in this game series, No Retreat 4: Italian Front 1943-45.&#10;&#10;This game will be using a mix of all the previous No Retreat! game concepts/systems, including some from the solitaire module, to depict this long and gruelling campaign with the minimum of fuss and the fastest possible play time. Each turn will represent one or two months (depending on the weather), but not every Turn will see major action! So during Frontline lulls very little combat, if any, will take place but for frontline attrition, so these turns will pass in a speedy manner. When a side decide to go on the offensive then that specific turn will see a series of moves/combat/activations (like was done for NR2); using a variant of the regular No Retreat &ldquo;Target/Counterblow&rdquo; rules and markers. The important sea invasions will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, and the long set-pieces battles (like Cassino or Anzio) will be represented correctly without bogging down game play. Like in NR3 &ldquo;Secret Campaign Plans&rdquo; will make an appearance, with players vying to attain special high command objectives, thus getting bonus victory points if the game does not end in an early &ldquo;Sudden Death&rdquo; and continues to the bitter end.&#10;&#10;To make the play surface more easy to use, the long Italian peninsula will be represented by a series of separate maps each showing a part of the battleground. As the frontline moves north or south, players will switch the &ldquo;play map&rdquo; map to show the actual areas of operations, thus saving a lot of table space. It will also be possible under certain circumstances for players to actually change sides in the game (keeping their accumulated Victory points): Thus both will be able to get the chance to be on the &ldquo;attacking side&rdquo; if wished for; historically the Germans were mostly on the defensive. The Event card system will also be changed a bit, with each card allowing multiple possible effects/events: all the cards will be useful, even when the main event cannot be used because of Strategic Initiative.&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;But wait, there is more! For this deluxe edition, the Invasion of Sicily will be added as a separate mini-game. Very fast-playing, and will be an excellent learning or tournament game; that can be also linked to the main campaign game. Could the Axis have delayed the Allies longer on the island? And what if only a token holding attack was made, with the main landings a short while later on the mainland? Or Sicily completely bypassed altogether?&#10;&#10;Italian Front Scenario Listing&#10;&#10;    Regular Game: The 1943/45 full campaign. Both players will choose a &ldquo;Campaign Plan&rdquo; that will instruct them as to their general objectives; there is a chance that one could also be imposed by the game system in case of failure! A players&rsquo; &ldquo;switch of sides&rdquo; could also occur because of the plans or player&rsquo;s will. The outcome of the Sicily mini-game can be linked to this scenario. Players can also change the Strength of the Armies and rate of reinforcements.&#10;    Historical Game:  The 1943/45 full campaign, but with the Plan choices limited to the more historically plausible alternatives. No switch of sides can occur. The Sicily mini-game is not used.&#10;    Short Early game: The first part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Southern Italian maps will be used, and the game will end in Early 1944 (historically after the Anzio invasion petered out).&#10;    Short Late game: The second part of the 1943/45 campaign. Only the Northern Italian maps will be used, and the game will Start where the previous &ldquo;Early game&rdquo; scenario stops, and continues until the end of the war in 1945.&#10;    Sicily Game: This mini-game can be played &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; or linked to the Regular Game Scenario. It also makes for an excellent fast-playing Tournament scenario.&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 1 month per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 10 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Divisions&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One 17&quot;x22&quot; two-sided map&#10;        Two 17&quot;x22&quot; one-sided maps&#10;        47 Event cards and 8 Leader cards&#10;        One sheet of 88 round markers; 24 hex markers&#10;        One sheet of 88 two-sided square unit counters&#10;        Rulebook&#10;        Scenario Book&#10;        Player Aid Mat&#10;        Two 6-sided dic&#10;&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Jack Stalica&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler&#10;MAP ART &amp; RULEBOOK LAYOUT: Charles Kibler&#10;&#10;"

On a turn, you choose one card, carry out its effect, then refill your hand to five cards. Event cards might duplicate existing sheep cards, add new ones, swap one value of sheep for another, remove sheep, etc. Play through the deck until you have no cards in hand, then shuffle the event cards.&#10;&#10;If you go through the deck three times without having at least one 1,000 sheep card in the field or if at any point in the game you have no sheep in the field, then you lose.&#10;&#10;"

Each of these artists have traded in their pencils and brushes for battle armor and wands in an effort to embrace their inner swordsman, warrior, and healer. This exhibition of artwork celebrates each artist as a creator, individual, and a modern-day art hero and role model.&#10;&#10;Each artist's self-portrait represents a character in the game that players use to outwit their enemies, form their ranks, battle against foes, define their allies, and go to battle in the hope of obtaining influence and, ultimately, power over the fallen land of Vyk'Tornaahl.&#10;&#10;At heart Rolemodels is a poker variant with additional rules and flavor. Players start the game with five cards in hand. Three cards from the deck are revealed to form the Adventurer's Tavern. At the start of a round, the dealer rolls a d20 die to determine the amount of influence up for grabs. Each player then takes one of two actions on his turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Draw two cards, one from the Adventurer's Tavern and the other from the face-up cards or the deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Declare battle, which takes place in two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Scout Phase: Whoever started the battle plays two cards (called &quot;Scouts&quot;) face up in front of him. Each other player in turn decided whether to pass or join the battle; in the latter case, they also play two Scouts face up.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Reinforcements Phase: First, a player can choose to surrender and withdraw from battle. All players who don't surrender, then simulaneously play and reveal three cards as reinforcements. Whoever has the strongest cards wins the available influence; in games with three and four players, the second best hand wins half this amount of influence.&#10;&#10;&#10;After discard all played cards, the player who initiated battle draws two cards, then a new round begins. When one player has fifty or more influence, the game ends and he wins.&#10;&#10;"

Within the time limit, they endeavor to place the letters they drew.&#10;&#10;The game requires a electronic timer, which is not included; it is recommended that each round be allowed one minute each, but it can be changed to reflect players' skill levels.&#10;&#10;Players must work together to use consonants as they are drawn, within the time limit. Players can plan ahead so that they will be ready for certain letters.&#10;&#10;This game is ideal for environments where players are extremely unmatched; instead of one player having to cheat to lose, all players work together and the timer can be adjusted to reflect the skill of the group.&#10;&#10;"
