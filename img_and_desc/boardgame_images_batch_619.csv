Features include Widerstandnesten (resistance nests), Cherbourg&rsquo;s fortifications and the all-important Bocage. The map portrays all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain, along with the villages, towns and cities that formed the bastions of German defense. As always with this series, the orders of battle have been extensively researched to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides.&#10;&#10;There are three introductory one-map scenarios depicting critical periods in the campaign that use an abbreviated set of rules while still maintaining the historical accuracy of the campaign game as a whole. In addition, there are three larger multi-map scenarios that allow players to either play a short period within the overall campaign or play the campaign from various starting points. The 6 June assault is covered in two modules, the Airborne Assault Module and the Amphibious Assault module, which allow players to recreate both the airborne and initial amphibious assault stage of the campaign.

These engagements involved General Longstreet&rsquo;s attack against Sickles&rsquo; positions, with troops from Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions, assisted as well by Anderson&rsquo;s Division of A.P. Hill&rsquo;s Corps.&#10;&#10;The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale game that players can complete in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules overhead normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. Unlike traditional chit-pull systems, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.&#10;&#10;UNITS&#10;&#10;All regiments and batteries of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each unit has a Strength Point number, with each point equaling 50 men or 1 artillery piece, and a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience.&#10;&#10;SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS&#10;&#10;Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a unique four-D6 dice mechanic. All four differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The black and white dice generate an initial result ranging from 11 to 66. The other two dice (red and blue) simultaneously give the players the tangible effect of the initial result and represent physical casualties suffered by the unit (the red die) and the morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire (the blue die).&#10;&#10;Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, Maneuver or Rally. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.&#10;&#10;Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system is a unique mechanic and generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for the players. It features four different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:&#10;&#10;Division Activation Chits. These activate any one Brigade (not yet activated) from the Division listed on the chit. However, further Brigade activations from this Division are dependent on the Division General&rsquo;s Command Rating and a die roll. A successful die roll places the chit back into the cup and thereby the other Brigades of the Division have a chance to activate in the future.  A failed die roll discards the chit for the turn and the remaining Brigades will not be able to activate normally (however, see below). &#10;CIC Chits.  These are a special kind of Activation Chit. The Union player has a Sickles chit and the Confederate player has a Longstreet chit. These chits allow the player to select any one Brigade in the game for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate a Brigade twice in the turn or activate a Brigade from a Division that has lost its Division Activation Chit. &#10;Event Chits.  There are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of each turn, players may select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are also then placed into the cup with the previously pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they chose. Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all the chits have a different Event listed) and a Command Event side. The Unique Event is a tactical event that can be used on the battlefield and each Event has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Examples are Rebel Yell!, Union Logistics, Quick March and Heroic Stand. The Command Event side is used for more strategic options. The Union player may call for reinforcements from the rest of the Army of the Potomac (only the III Corps Divisions are available at start) and the Confederate player can attempt to better coordinate his attack (by increasing his Division General&rsquo;s Command Ratings). &#10;Wild Chits.  These are the two &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; chits. One chit is Fog of War, which can possibly cause units from either side to conduct unexpected attacks or withdrawals, or can cause General officer casualties. The other chit is Fortunes of War which will immediately discard the next chit pulled with no effect &ndash; including that special pre-selected Event chit if it happens to come up!&#10; MAP&#10;&#10;The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire south end of the Gettysburg battlefield.

When a player reaches the last City named on his Ticket, he throws his Red Ticket aside (as it is not used again in the game), and continues to play and draw front White Tickets until he reaches Constantinople.&#10;&#10;After a ticket has been used it is thrown into a discarded pile or placed under the bottom of the stack from which it was originally drawn. The players, by this process, eventually reach CONSTANTINOPLE, which is the turning point of the game.&#10;&#10;AFTER REACHING CONSTANTINOPLE, a player must draw Blue Route Tickets, which will eventually bring him back to Boston or New York. The player making a TOUR OF EUROPE, as far as Constantinople, and first arriving at the last City mentioned on his return card (either Boston or New York), WINS THE GAME.&#10;&#10;It will be seen that a player may make the trip very quickly, or that it may take a long time. The first Red Card that he draws will take him across the Ocean, but he may have to play upon the cities mentioned on several WHITE Cards before he reaches Constantinople, and he may draw several Blue Route Tickets after reaching Constantinople ere he gets back to Boston or New York.&#10;&#10;N. B. &mdash; Players must move on EVERY City mentioned on EVERY Route Card they draw. Players can only move to the next City mentioned on Their Route Card, in one turn, therefore it will take six turns to reach the last City mentioned on a card having six names of Cities, etc. The red dots on the Ocean, such as Storm, Rescue, Fog, etc., supposed to represent incidents in the ocean trip, are used in the game exactly as the cities are.&#10;&#10;GOING TO DINNER. It sometimes occurs that Two players meet in the same City, in which case they go to DINNER together, that is, both pieces are put upon the Dinner space, or picture, in the corner of the board. Players do NOT remain upon the Dinner space but remove to the next City on their routes (the Dinner only being an incident in their journey).&#10;&#10;It does not require a SEPARATE turn to go to Dinner, the pieces being immediately placed on the Dinner picture on their meeting in any foreign City. Remember that you draw a Red Ticket on the first turn only. The White Tickets are used to carry you to Constantinople, and the Blue ones to bring you home. This will be easily remembered from the order, Red, White and Blue.&#10;&#10;The board (from the 1st edition) sits on top of a wood framed bottom and there is a sliding drawer in the side for the game pieces to go into. The 2nd edition comes without sliding drawer.&#10;&#10;"

But there have always been a few brave souls who have fought to hold it back. They are called HUNTERS. Hunters: Battle of Arkady is a fully cooperative action/horror board game for 2 to 6 players ages 13 and up.&#10;&#10;Hunters: Battle of Arkady uses poker-sized cards to create a dynamic playing board, allowing each game experience to be different. Players then work together to defeat the Arch-Demon Avenastur before the town of Arkady is consumed by darkness. Players have a choice of six characters to play as, each with individual stats and abilities. During the course of play, additional monsters are revealed and must be fought or dismissed as the character's abilities allow.&#10;&#10;Each turn has eight phases, beginning with the character's movement about the board. Avenastur (the Demon) then moves to &quot;chase&quot; the nearest player. If the player has moved, then one or more monster cards are revealed. Once there is a monster in the player's &quot;stack&quot; then the attack/defense part of their turn begins. The player must always roll their attack, depending on the number of d6s their character has, and then roll the attack of the monster who attempts to hit them. Once all the monsters in the &quot;stack&quot; are defeated, the character my Investigate their location. Certain locations have special perks, such as extra lives that can be collected for use by any player, or additional abilities granted to all players. Next the player can regen their health/mana pool as their stats allow. Finally, the Growing Darkness phase flips a location card facedown, losing any special perks remaining, and ending the player's turn.&#10;&#10;The game is won or lost depending on the defeat of the &quot;Main Boss&quot; Avenastur. Killing him wins the game for all the players. However, if the town of Arkady is overrun by the Growing Darkness, the players lose.&#10;&#10;"
