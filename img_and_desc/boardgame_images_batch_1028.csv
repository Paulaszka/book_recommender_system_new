You take on the role of a Ranger, a protector of the mountain valley you call home: a vast wilderness transformed by monumental feats of science and technology devised to save the Earth from destruction long ago. The story of Earthborne Rangers is presented as a branching narrative campaign consisting of a main storyline and a multitude of side stories. In it, you can choose to follow the critical path or to strike off on your own to discover the Valley's many engaging characters, mysterious ruins, and beings both familiar and strange.&#10;&#10;You begin by building a deck that reflects your Ranger's interests, personal history, and personality. Then, as you explore the open world and your story takes shape, you augment your deck with improved equipment, refined skills, and the memories of your journey.&#10;&#10;Each game session represents one day in the Valley, and you'll pick up in the same location on the map where you rested the night before. Your goal is to either complete one of your available missions or to explore the open world. The session ends when you're either forced to rest (through either fatigue or injury), or you choose to rest for the night.&#10;&#10;An individual game session is played in rounds, and those rounds consist of turns. On your turn, you perform one action: either play a card from your hand, or choose an action from a card on the table. Each action allows you to interact thematically and narratively with the world, and each time you take an action, the world comes to life around you. Predators stalk their prey, rain pours from the sky, rocks tumble down the mountain to block your path, and much more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player needs, in their own color, a large number of stackable tokens and tiles.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;In Seesaw the players command opposing armies of soldiers that can promote. Your army starts out as a single soldier in the bottom corner. This soldier stands on a tile of your color. This tile is your initial promotion area, and it will evolve as you deploy more soldiers. Every time a soldier promotes it grows - first into a 2-stack, then a 3-stack, and so on.&#10;&#10;The central idea of Seesaw is the 2-fold significance of stack-size: &#10;(i) Odd-sized stacks move forwards and even-sized stacks move backwards, and &#10;(ii) on any given turn, a stack can take as many steps as it likes from 1 up to its size.&#10;&#10;This results in soldiers seesawing up and down the board as their strength increases to the point where the game is forced to conclude in one side completely eliminating the other.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;On your turn, you must either move a stack, or place a new stack.&#10;&#10;1. Placing a new stack: &#10;A newly placed stack will always be of size 1. You may only place a stack on an empty cell next to a cell with a tile of your color. These cells are promotion cells, and each time you place a new stack you first place a tile of your color on that cell. A cell with a tile on it is not considered empty, but tiles never count toward stacks-size.&#10;&#10;2. Moving a stack:&#10;You only ever move one stack per turn, but that stack may be able to move several steps or capture several enemy stacks, depending on its size.&#10;The number of steps a stack may take is the number of pieces in it, i.e. its size. A stack may never step onto a cell containing a stack of its color.&#10;&#10;2.1 Noncapturing moves: On turns where you do not have to capture an enemy (see below) all the steps a stack takes is either constrained to the 3 upward directions (&quot;forwards&quot;) or to the 3 downward directions (&quot;backwards&quot;), depending on the parity of the size of the stack. Up and down have their standard meanings for games where players sit on opposite sides of a board, like in Draughts and Chess.&#10;&#10;2.2 Capturing moves: If one or more of your stacks can reach an enemy by lifting the restraint on direction, you must capture such a reachable enemy by replacement. If that stack did not spend all its steps reaching the captured enemy, you can, before you end your turn, spend the left-over steps by making a noncapturing move. However, if yet an enemy is in range immediately after you have captured (counting only the steps left over), you must capture again.&#10;&#10;3. Promoting: Your odd-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to your opponent at the end of your turn. Your even-sized stacks promote when they end up on a promotion cell belonging to you at the end of your turn. When a stack promotes, you add 1 piece to it.&#10;&#10;The object of Seesaw is to capture all your opponent's soldiers. More precisely: If, at the end of your turn, your opponent has no stacks on the board, you have won the game.&#10;&#10;"

342929,,"Garner is a combinatorial card game for two players where you seek to collect a majority of cards in a majority of suits. It is played with a deck of cards containing 5 suits of 15 numbers each.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Shuffle the deck and fan out 25 stacks of 3 cards each in a regular layout of 5 rows and 5 columns. All cards should be visible, and it should be clear which cards are on which layer of the layout. (The 25 top cards in the initial position are on the top layer, and underneath that there are two more layers of 25 cards each.)&#10;&#10;Definitions:&#10;Every card belongs in a number group together with all and only those cards which are connected to it by a sequence of orthogonal steps between cards with equal numbers. The members of a group all lie on the same layer.&#10;A suit group is defined the same way, except &quot;number&quot; is replaced with &quot;suit&quot;.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;On your turn, you first distribute a number group, then you collect a suit group.&#10;&#10;Distribute: Pick up a number group from the current top layer and distribute them anew on the layout. You may not place two of these cards in the same stack, and you may not place them underneath any cards. Other than that, you are free to choose any of the 25 sites in the layout. There is no limit on how many cards there can be at each site.&#10;&#10;Collect: Pick up any suit group from the current top layer and store those cards in a personal scoring pile on your side of the board.&#10;&#10;Ending the game:&#10;When all cards are collected, the winner is the player whose scoring pile contains the majority of the cards in the majority of the suits.&#10;&#10;Slight variations: &#10;&#10;     Add the requirement that all cards (or at least one card) in the chosen number group are in a new position after distributing.&#10;     When distributing, cards must be moved in a straight (diagonal or orthogonal) line.&#10;&#10;&#10;Decks you can play Garner with:&#10;Rage&#10;Stick 'Em&#10;5&deg;Dimension Playing Card Game&#10;Sluff Off!&#10;Tricky Bid&#10;David &amp; Goliath&#10;&#10;Ways of playing with more traditional decks:&#10;&#10;(A) &#10;&#10;     9 cards in 3 suits from a standard French deck. &#10;     Layout: 9 stacks of 3 cards each in a 3x3 grid.&#10;&#10;&#10;(B) &#10;&#10;     12 cards in 3 suits from a standard French deck. &#10;     Layout: 9 stacks of 4 cards each in a 3x3 grid. &#10;     Extra rule: You may never have exactly 6 cards in a suit in your scoring pile.

This is accomplished by the help of a very liberal understanding of &quot;stack&quot;: A single piece is considered a stack of size 1, and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.&#10;&#10;The basic principle of movement is simple: A stack may move to a cell it can see &ndash; i.e. one that is adjacent or joins it in flanking a line of empty cells &ndash; if this cell is not occupied by a bigger stack.&#10;&#10;It is important that, every time you remove a stack from the board, whether it was one of yours of an enemy stack, you keep one of its pieces in a designated area (off the board) as a reminder. I'll get back to why you need to keep count of removed stacks.&#10;&#10;There is an economy to moving whole stacks, which is responsible for stack's coming into and going out of existence (rules for moving proper parts of stacks are given farther down):&#10;&#10;Outward movement gains you:&#10;When a move increases the number of steps away from the center cell the moved stack is, it grows by the addition of 1 piece per step further away it ends up. Pieces initially only come onto the board by moving a stack of size 0 at least 1 step away from the center cell.&#10;&#10;Non-outward movement costs you:&#10;When a move does not increase the number of steps away from the center cell the moved stack is, it shrinks by the removal of 1 more than 1 piece per step closer it ends up. This means that a stack not moving outward can travel no farther inward than 1 less than its size.&#10;&#10;Reproduction tax:&#10;If you increase the number of stacks you own, the resulting size of the newly created stack must be big enough to pay a reproduction tax equal to the number of stacks you have removed from the board (whether friendly or not). For each removed stack, you must subtract a piece from the newly created stack, and the gross size of the stack must be bigger than the number of stacks you have lost, so that its net size is at least 1. If white's reproduction tax is 2, moving a 0-stack three steps away from the center will only result in a 1-stack.&#10;&#10;Splitting stacks:&#10;Instead of moving a whole stack, you may move a proper part of a stack. Only the reproduction tax applies to the moving of proper stack parts. This means that a splitting move can get you places a whole stack move can't.&#10;&#10;Splitting a stack can (and normally does) increase the number of stacks you own. When it does, a reproduction tax must be paid.&#10;&#10;There is no free passing in Ashes. If you can move, you must. This ensures that stacks must eventually (if they are not captured before that) spend all their pieces moving &quot;non-outward&quot;, and the reproduction tax will eventually be too high to enter a new stack on the board. The game is over as soon as one player has no stacks on the board and is unable to grow a new stack.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

When checking for repetitions, two identical board positions are still considered different if the button had already been taken in one of them but not in the other.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsConvacu: The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. If you have no other moves available, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. If, at the end of a turn, there is a group touching the two opposite board edges of its color, the owner of that group wins.&#10;&#10;"

Alice in the Wonder Museum, each player has a hand of cards featuring small and large portraits of seven characters from the books by Lewis Carrol. The game has a whimsical graphic design, utilizing the original illustrations by John Tenniel.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a hand of five cards where every small portrait matches a large portrait. Upon building a complete hand, the player scores a point for each small portrait in their hand. The first player to 20 points wins.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps four cards in their hand. On your turn, you draw from the deck or the discards of other players. Trying to build a set of matching cards in hand is a puzzle, with each card having one large portrait and one to three small portraits. If your turn ends without creating a completed hand, discard one card face up in front of you. Be careful, because other players will be able to choose from your discards, but you cannot.&#10;&#10;"
