One hero stays in camp to rest and maintain the fire while the others battle. Each round, you draw a new location to setup camp in. Survive all 8 nights (rounds) to win the game.&#10;&#10;New adventurers include:&#10;&#10;    Corsair who earns coin by defeating enemies and mitigates bad dice rolls by taking gambles.&#10;    Druid who has their own unique nature deck full of animals that will aid him in battle. This deck can allow the Druid to shapeshift or seed the creature deck with his animal allies.&#10;    Earth Golem with d12 dice whose powers trigger off the location card for each round of the game. It can use stored earth essence to pip up its dice when bad luck strikes, making it one of the most consistent warriors in the series.&#10;    Fire Sorceress who draws her power from the campfire itself. Drawing too much from the fire means you can see less enemies in the darkness so balancing offensive abilities with her other abilities that rekindle the campfire are essential.&#10;&#10;&#10;Set a Watch: Forsaken Isles is both a standalone game for 1-4 players and an expansion that can be combined with the original Set A Watch and Set A Watch: Swords of the Coin.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The Blind Swords system uses chit pulls and activation rolls to simulate the command confusion and difficulty of coordinating 19th century armies. Additionally, each turn a number of events can impact the ability of armies to carry out their plans. The basic units are regiments of infantry or cavalry and batteries of artillery which are rated for size, armament, and cohesion/morale.&#10;&#10;Perryville was a short fierce battle between Buell's Army of the Ohio and Bragg's Army of the Tennessee. While Bragg thought he was facing only a small portion of the Army of the Ohio, he was in fact confronting almost its entirety. Buell thought he was facing all of Bragg's Army and possibly even Kirby Smith's Army of Kentucky. Instead Buell was facing only about 2/3 of Bragg's army.&#10;&#10;After an early morning skirmish, both armies assembled on the battlefield just northwest of the crossroads of Perryville. What had been planned as a flanking attack against the Union II Corps instead turned into a frontal assault on the newly arrived Union I Corps, half of which consisted of new recruits. Despite a ferocious battle raging about two miles from his headquarters, Buell was unaware of the Confederate attack and was astonished that one of his corps had been smashed by the vicious assault. Only a few brigades were sent to assist the beleaguered I Corps and the Confederates claimed a tactical victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The city is run by moneybags, though, and now it's time to seize opportunities as swindlers and cutpurses to claim your share of their wealth.&#10;&#10;Swindler combines press-your-luck with take-that mechanisms for a fun and thematic game set in Victorian London. Each round, players must steal from one of the five moneybags, drawing tokens from the chosen bag. Each bag is filled with coins, jewelry, and other loot &mdash; but each bag also contains at least one skull! If you draw a skull, you've pressed your luck too far and got caught in the act. Not only will you lose the loot you stole that round, you also lose everything you stole from the same bag in previous rounds. The moneybag not only found your hand in their pocket, but they also recognized the small but precious ring on your finger...&#10;&#10;It's wise not to sit on the loot too long in case you get caught. Dealers will pay you for the loot you turn in, giving you points. You can also use your loot to complete orders, but one of your fellow swindlers might be faster and push you aside to complete a task, costing you valuable points. Thankfully, you don't have to swindle on your own! Hire accomplices to gain advantages or affect the other players with disadvantages.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points after a set number of rounds will be recognized as the most notorious swindler of London and thus win the game.&#10;&#10;"
