You may even end up with more animals than you started with.&#10;&#10;The zoo is divided into four coloured zones.  In each zone there are coloured rings for individual animals.  Game play chooses the coloured zone each player must place an animal in and as an animal cannot be placed on a ring which is overlapped by a ring already containing an animal things can get a little squashed.  Any player that cannot place an animal in the required zone must pick up all the animals in that zone.  The winner is the first to get rid of all his animals.&#10;&#10;

Analyzing the available potions and trying to predict the interplay between them and the value of victory points vs. the effects of the potions is a key element of play.&#10;&#10;"

In the game, which is played out on a scrolling space backdrop, the players take on the roles of brave space pilots sweeping around in nimble yet powerful fighters, searching the asteroid clusters for universal glory and ancient technology. Players compete to obtain the most glory, with glory resulting from carrying out missions, finding lost treasure in asteroid clusters, and destroying alien entities, not to mention other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, players fly through an ever-scrolling space setting, which is represented by rows of cards. Each turn, the bottom row is removed and a new row is added to the top. Players move their spaceships and resolve effects continuously, performing actions such as collecting power-ups and money, fighting alien cruisers and titans, blocking and shooting other players, and dodging asteroids and black holes. The players need to balance the use of their ships' energy as it's used for both absorbing enemy fire and boosting their movement speed and fire rate.&#10;&#10;The game includes missions and achievements as well as a mechanism called &quot;threat level&quot; to keep everyone in suspense throughout the whole game. Threat allows players to enjoy the satisfaction of both shooting wildly at each other and dodging the hundreds of bullets raining down from enemy fighters and other players.&#10;&#10;All player ships are fully upgradeable with four different weapon classes, engines, shields and more. Each player must buy the upgrades and navigate the path that best fits his chosen strategy in order to successfully complete his missions and attain the most glory.&#10;&#10;"

A very similar game is played by children in Argentina, where it is known as Casita Robada. In Italy it is known as Rubamazzo, and in Quebec it is called Paquet Voleur (literal translation of steal pile in French).&#10;&#10;Players and Cards&#10;&#10;Stealing Bundles is a fairly simple fishing game, for 2, 3 or 4 players, normally using a standard 52-card pack. To start the game, everyone draws a card and the player drawing the highest card deals first.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;&#10;The dealer shuffles, and then deals the cards out clockwise one at a time: four cards face down to each player and four face up to the centre of the table. The centre cards are laid out separately so that all are visible. The remainder of the pack is kept face down by the dealer and will be used later. The players then pick up their hands of four cards and look at them (but of course are not allowed to look at other players' cards).&#10;&#10;The player to the dealer's left starts, the turn to play passes clockwise around the table. At your turn you must play one card from your hand face up to the table. If the card you play matches the rank of any of the face up centre cards, you must take the card you played and any matched cards and place them in a face up pile in front of you, to start your 'bundle'. (Suits are ignored in this game: a King matches a King, an Eight matches an Eight, and so on.) No matter whether you matched a card or not, it is then the next player's turn to play.&#10;&#10;Any matched cards that you acquire during the game are always stacked on top of your bundle, with the card you played on top, so that only this top card is visible.&#10;&#10;If you play a card that matches the top card of an opponent's bundle, you steal their whole of their bundle and add it to the top of yours, placing the matching card that you played on top.&#10;&#10;After everyone has played their four cards, the same dealer takes the remaining undealt cards and deals another four cards face down to each player, one at a time (but no further cards to the layout). Again the players look at their hands, and play continues as before. After all these cards have been played another four cards each are dealt by the same dealer, and this process of dealing and playing continues until all the cards have been dealt and everyone has played their last four cards. At this point, any cards remaining face up in the centre are added to the bundle of the last player who matched a card.&#10;&#10;Now the cards in each are counted and whoever has the largest bundle wins.&#10;&#10;If you want to play again, the turn to deal now passes to the left. The new dealer shuffles all the cards and another game is played as described above.&#10;&#10;Casita Robada and Rubamazzo&#10;&#10;The Argentinean game Casita Robata, is essentially the same. The only differences from Stealing Bundles are:&#10;&#10;A Spanish suited pack of 40 (or 48) cards is used;&#10;    The game is played counter-clockwise.&#10;&#10;The Italian game Rubamazzo is played counter-clockwise with an Italian 40-card pack.&#10;&#10;"

Board-game enthusiasts, families, and city planners alike will all find something to love about CITY. Each turn players have the chance to expand their city by zoning vacant land as residential, commercial or industrial.  Money allows players to buy roads to connect their zones. Points are earned by growing your city's population and by employing them with jobs - commercial banker, farmer, forester, miner, or driller. As the population and job opportunities expand, players have the opportunity to upgrade their zones and earn money, both of which earn players even more points. Soon after the game starts, new skyscrapers begin to sprout up across the region, players' zones begin to compete for resources and space, and strategic playing becomes an engaging and critical element to each city's success!&#10;&#10;As each player's city grows, resources and purchase power becomes limited.

The men represent and are called arrows, and are shot at the target by the proper moves. The object of the game is to see who will make the best shots with his three arrows. All moves are made by the spin of the Teetotum, using the mum of the numbers obtained by the spin, and moving an arrow aver a corresponding number of spaces. Spin for lead. The highest spin plays first. The arrows are first entered according to the spin, beginning st. and counting from the space at the flag-staff. After entering, each player, in turn, advances his arrows ac-cording to his spins, until they reach the target. Any arrow that is carried beyond the target by the spin is a miss, and counts nothing. An arrow is carried beyond the target when there are not enough spaces for it to be moved over, to use up the spin. Each ring of the target represents two spaces, one on each side sf the bull's-eye, as though the target were divided by a vertical (meat its center.&#10;&#10;The arrows are moved from the flag-staff to the target as though the whole formed one continuous line of 23 spaces-7 in the target, and 16 outside. As soon as an arrow reaches the target its move is ended. Two or more arrows of the same, or of opponent players, may 'soupy the same space at the same time. The game is ended when all the arrows have reached or missed the target. Each arrow on the outer circle counts 1; on the next ' circle, 2; on the third circle, 3; and, on the bull's-eye, 6.&#10;&#10;The player having the largest count wins the game.&#10;&#10;GAME OF MORRICE (Nine Men's Morris)&#10;&#10;Implements - Eighteen men in two colors; a set of nine for each player. The charming game of Morrice, which closely resembles, and is probably the source of &quot;Go-Bang,&quot; is the inside game, laid out in black lines, with circular spaces at the points where the lines cross or intersect each other. The object of each player is to get three of his men in a row, that is, upon the three spaces on any one of the straight black lines. All of the lines are used alike, no distinction being made between the long and the short ones. Play in turn throughout the game, and place or move but one man at a time. The players in turn, first place their men, one at a time, upon any vacant circular space, each trying to get three men in a row, and at the same time playing to prevent his opponent doing so. Thus, a player trying to form a row, will lay down two men upon the same ; but the opponent, if on the lookout, will lay down one of his men on the third space of the same line, and stop him. Sometimes players scatter their men in such a manner, that by laying down a single man, they have two ways by which they can form rows, upon their next turn, and as only one of these can be stopped by the opponent, they necessarily gain a point. Each time that a player, forms a row, he captures and removes One of his opponent's men front the board, but must, if possible, take one that will not break his rows. When all the men have been placed upon the board, one at a time, as above described, the players try to form rows by moving their men from space to space, in any direction. Sat all moves must be along the lines, always moving to the next space. As often as a player forms a row, whether in placing or moving his men, he captures one of his oppoaent's men. As soon as either player loses all but two of his men, he can form no more rows, and therefore loses the games&#10;&#10;GAME OF QUOITS&#10;&#10;Implements - Sixteen men in four colors&mdash;a set for each player, and the Double Teetotum. There are two sets of Quoit spaces, at each side of the board. The first and third players play for one set, and the second and fourth for the other.&#10;&#10;Play and spin in turn. The highest spin leads. Use the sum of the numbers indicated by the Teetotum in making the moves, except in case of a doublet, which has its corresponding numbered Quoit space. The first player spins and places his man upon the Quoit space which corresponds to his throw. The others follow in turn playing in the same manner. Four rounds are played in this way, and the score is then made up. The count is as follows : Each man on the hub counts ten ; on a double number, three ; and on the other numbers two. In addition to the above, the man nearest to the hub counts five I the next nearest, three'; and the third, one. If two men hit the same space, the first corner is set back one space, if the rear space is vacant ; if occupied, the man goes for-ward on space, but should this space also be occupied it is removed from the board and does not count for its player. When four rounds have been played, the game is begun anew, and the play continues until some one of the players scores 60, which wins the game. The object of the game may also be to see which will make the highest score in four rounds.&#10;&#10;"

The battle took place on 8 September 1380, at the Kulikovo Field near the Don River and was won by Dmitri, who became known as Donskoy (of the Don) after the battle. Although the victory did not end the Mongol rule over the Russian principalities, it is widely regarded by Russian historians as the turning point when Mongol influence began to wane and Muscovite power to rise&mdash;a process that eventually led to Muscovite independence and formation of the modern Russian state.&#10;&#10;This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:&#10;&#10;1.

Player B moves cavalry etc.&#10;&#10;Movement is determined by terrain and unit type. Battles are determined by comparing unit strength, which is modified by various factors (armor, charge, terrain, leaders etc.), and dice roll. Interesting elements of game mechanics include: fatigue of units, morale and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).&#10;&#10;"

On subsequent turns, each player may take one of two actions:&#10;- Play 2 cards (an operation card (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) and a point card) onto their pile or another player's pile, or &#10;- Discard one of the cards from his/her hand to the discard pile and draw a card from the draw pile.&#10;&#10;A scorekeeper is appointed at the beginning of the game, and keeps track of each player's score as they play cards on each player's piles.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach 15 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

You do this by picking a random game piece from the bag and placing it on your side of the board in an attempt to make a match of 3 or more like pieces. Once a match has been made you take those matched pieces and place them on your opponent's side of the board trying really hard to mess their day up. The game is over and you are victorious once your opponent can not make any matches whatsoever...even if they tried really really hard or their side of the board is full.&#10;&#10;To add some ball'n variation to the game there are different characters to play as; each with their own special ability that is triggered whenever that player makes a match of its color. There are also white game pieces and black game pieces that will help you and hinder your opponent when drawn.&#10;&#10;There is also a 2v2 game mode.&#10;&#10;

It is the Americanized version of a card game that originated in Central Europe in the late 18th century under the German name Schafkopf.&#10;&#10;Sheepshead is played with 7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits, for a total of 32 cards. A sheepshead deck is made by removing all of the jokers, sixes, fives, fours, threes, and twos from a standard deck.&#10;&#10;Card strength:&#10;Card strength in sheepshead is different than in most other games. It is one of the most difficult things for some beginners to grasp.&#10;&#10;There are 14 cards in the trump suit: all four queens, all four jacks, and all of the diamonds. In order of strength from greatest to least:&#10;&#10;Q&clubs; Q&spades; Q&hearts; Q&diams;&#10;J&clubs; J&spades; J&hearts; J&diams;&#10;A&diams; 10&diams; K&diams; 9&diams; 8&diams; 7&diams;&#10;Also, there are 6 of each &quot;fail&quot; suit (18 total).&#10;A, 10, K, 9, 8, and 7 of &clubs;, &spades;, and &hearts;&#10;&#10;Clubs, spades, and hearts take no precedence over other fail suits, unlike trump, which always take fail. (Notice how both aces and tens outrank kings; arguably the most confusing aspect of card strength). The lead suit must be followed if possible; if not, then any card may be played such as trump (which will take the trick), or a fail card. Playing a fail of a different suit is called &quot;throwing off&quot; and can be a way to clear up another suit. Additionally, throwing off a point card is called &quot;schmearing&quot;.&#10;&#10;Card point values:&#10;Each card is given a separate point value as follows:&#10;Ace &mdash; 11 points&#10;Ten &mdash; 10 points&#10;King &mdash; 4 points&#10;Queen &mdash; 3 points&#10;Jack &mdash; 2 points&#10;9, 8, 7 &mdash; 0 points&#10;&#10;The strongest cards (queens and jacks) are not worth the most points, giving Sheepshead some of its unusual character.&#10;There are 120 points total in the deck. The goal of the game is to get half of these (60 or 61); in case of a tie, the player who picked up the blind loses, and that player's opponents win. (There are variant rules for more peculiar situations, such as the Leaster.)&#10;&#10;This is one of the few traditional card games with a hidden partner.&#10;&#10;Jack of Diamonds is a random partner method where the picker receives a partner without needing to call or lead a suit. The picker can still choose to &quot;go it alone&quot;, but needs to declare before the hand begins.&#10;&#10;"

Incorrect math indicates guilt. Players decide if their suspect is innocent or guilty and later take turns vocalizing their verdict and mathematical reasoning. Points are awarded based on correct determination of a suspect&rsquo;s innocence or guilt and also for describing why the guilty party&rsquo;s alibi did not jive (i.e., why the math was incorrect). The winner is the player with the most points after a pre-determined number of rounds or time limit set at the beginning of game play. You&rsquo;ll need to draw on a variety of math skills to solve these whodunit mysteries as each game includes 50 different cases.&#10;&#10;"

While with low bid, the side which won more tricks loses 1 point for each trick they have in excess of 6.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;The partnership which first reaches 13 points wins the game.

The game consists of a central six-pointed star piece, each point being marked on both outer edges with a number of dots from one to six, and thirty-six triangular tiles marked along their edges with numbers ranging from one to six.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, the tiles are placed face down and shuffled, and two or more players draw an agreed upon number.  The player who has drawn a tile with three sixes goes first, matching a tile to one of the central star's numbered edges.  The players then take turns matching their tiles to the original in order to create a hexagon shaped star adjoining the central piece.  If no match is possible, a player must pass.  The player who completes the hexagonal star gets one point, and the next player begins another star by matching a tile to the central star.  If no player can match a piece, that star is blocked and play begins on another.  The player scoring the most points (there are a maximum of six) wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
