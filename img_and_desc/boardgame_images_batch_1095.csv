Six months later, General Erwin Rommel would push German troops to restore all that the Italians lost, and then capture those parts of Egypt that were part of the original Axis plan. The British and their Commonwealth allies recovered and twice forced Rommel back to his starting point. The armies of both sides maneuvered and intertwined in ferocious battles at soon to become famous locations, including Tobruk, Gazala, Halfaya Pass, Buq Buq, El Alamein and others. The pace of mechanized warfare would sweep the Western Desert no less than 5 times in what would be defined as the most elastic theater of operations in WWII, where supply drove the tempo, and the open flank beckoned one more offensive!&#10;&#10;Desert Victory: North Africa, 1940-1942 is a low-complexity, high-detailed wargame set in eastern Libya and western Egypt during the formative years of WWII. Following on the heels of Battle for Kursk: The Tigers are Burning, 1943 found in C3iNr34, it is the second volume of the C3i Combined Arms Series and uses many of the same mechanics. In DV players manage their supplies and maneuver their forces to achieve victory in a game where both sides rapidly switch between offense and defense. Not familiar with the Western Desert campaign? No problem, as the Turn Record Track shows exactly what happened historically, allowing players to learn history and compare their game progress to actual results. Of paramount importance is the capture of coastal towns that allow a side to move their Supply Head forward to enable more efficient movement and combat. Furthermore, displacing an opponent&rsquo;s Supply Head may frustrate their plans and capture much needed fuel. Supply, reinforcements, and replacements are all set at historical levels, and it&rsquo;s up to the players to assess the correlation of forces and decide the opportune moment to press forward in search of the elusive automatic win; can you formulate a plan to achieve Desert Victory before your offensive power expires?&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Units: Brigade, Division or Corps &#10;Map: 1 Hex = 25 miles &#10;Turns: Quarterly Turns (three months per turn)&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 3 hours&#10;&#10;"

The first player to collect ten Bohnentalers wins.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player receives two order cards, each of which shows five orders; the player tries to complete orders on one card while using the other to cover completed orders. The easiest orders to complete &mdash; say, three beans in any combination of two types &ndash; are at the bottom of the card, and the hardest ones &mdash; requiring, say, a three-of-a-kind plus a rare bean &ndash; are at the top. Orders must be completed from bottom to top.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player starts by rolling the five bean dice, three of which have one combination of beans and two of which have another combination. This player must set aside at least one bean, then they reroll any remaining dice, setting at least one aside, etc. After at most seven rolls, they complete as many orders as they can, reusing the dice as needed to complete orders. Once a player completes three orders, they can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of three. When a player harvests the order card, they draw a new card and use that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card they already had.&#10;&#10;In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade. In W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, the active player doesn't trade dice, but opponents do get to benefit from that player's rolls. After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &mdash; and not dice already set aside &mdash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much as their opponents might benefit from their turn more than they do.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected ten Bohnentalers. The player with the most Bohnentalers wins!&#10;&#10;Bohnanza: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel features the same gameplay as W&uuml;rfel Bohnanza, but uses fewer dice, has only five orders on a card instead of six, lowers the victory threshold, and has a few other changes.&#10;&#10;"
