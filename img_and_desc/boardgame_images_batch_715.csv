When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers. No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.

The strategy of using Fire Bases (also termed Fire Support Bases) was created as part of President Nixon&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Vietnamization&rdquo; of the conflict in which US forces were gradually withdrawn and the bulk of the fighting turned over to the ARVN (Army of the Republic of [South] Vietnam). General George Casey, Sr. developed the Fire Base strategy in which US Artillery and other battlefield support assets were deliberately deployed in forward areas to disrupt the Communists&rsquo; lines of communication and supply, thereby inviting them to attack. Once the enemy was in the open and engaged the US forces would then call in massive amounts of air and artillery support to wreak devastation upon their foe. A Fire Base was only to be in one location 3 to 5 days, and extensive fortifications were not possible as everything had to be removed and redeployed by helicopter in a matter of hours. By April 1st 1970 Fire Base Illingworth had been in place for 11 days, allowing the NVA to completely map-out the American&rsquo;s positions, size up the garrison, and determine its weak points. Adding to Fire Base Illingworth&rsquo;s woes was the arrival of thousands of 8 inch artillery rounds on March 31st. The garrison had only hours to provide rudimentary protection for the new ammo dump by the time of the NVA&rsquo;s attack.&#10;&#10;The survivors of Alpha Troop and Charlie Companies who were garrisoning the fire base thought they had reached a place of refuge where they could rest, recuperate, and train their newly arrived replacements (FNGs as they were derisively termed by the veterans). However, the NVA saw the opportunity to exact revenge upon the Americans grow with each passing day Fire Base Illingworth remained in place.&#10;&#10;"

Once all the treasure is divided, pirates vote on whether to keep their hidden shares, or return the loot to the chest.&#10;&#10;To gain the support of the crew, it's important to be fair.

197903,,"Unholy Upheaval is a game that takes place in the Kingdom of Axios. Four sages, drawn by a mysterious power, accidentally disrupt the harmony of the forces behind the manifest world. Unwittingly they freed a great and terrible power, Orono. The sages recognized their mistake, but were hastily locked away by the knights of the Kingdom. With no one left to stop Orono, the Ancient Forces who formed Axios, must now gain back the loyalty of their creation and return harmony to the kingdom.&#10;&#10;In Unholy Upheaval players take the role of one of the 4 Ancient Forces of Axios. Using what limited resources they have, players must gain back the loyalty of their creation and take the power back from Orono. Whoever can acquire the most of Orono&rsquo;s fragments will take the place as the dominant force once harmony is returned to Axios.&#10;&#10;The playstyle of Unholy Upheaval is deck-building with minor PvP elements. Each player starts with a starter set of 10 cards and 0 fragments. They utilize their starter cards to build a more powerful deck from a common pool of available cards, the Aether.&#10;&#10;The playing take turns playing and purchasing cards. Each turn follows the followng structure:&#10;1. Check for any relic effects in your battlefield and perform their actions.&#10;2. Play cards from your hand. Each card will provide either resources (Loyalty, Rage, Fragments)or provide powerful effects. Play Minions to your battlefield face up, and Relics into your opponent&rsquo;s battlefields face up. Resolve all text on each card before playing another card.&#10;3. Use loyalty to acquire Minions and Relics from the Aether. Defeat Shards from the Aether with rage, and gather Fragments from the supply as indicated on each card.&#10;4. Once you have finished acquiring and defeating cards, place all Minion cards played this turn (that are not haunted) face up in your Discard Pile and draw 5 new cards from your deck (if you need to draw a card and cannot, simply shuffle your discard pile to create a new deck.)&#10;&#10;Unholy Upheaval ends when the last Fragment is taken from the pool and the round is complete. This way every player has the same number of turns. Players can still earn Fragments after the last one is taken.&#10;&#10;Each player counts the Fragments in their pool then adds that to fragment value of the cards in their deck. This number is represented by the fragment symbol in the upper right hand corner of Minions. Relics and Shards do not count towards your score at the end of the game. The player with the most total Fragments is the winner. In case of ties the player with the most relics in their deck is the winner&#10;&#10;"

North, East, South, and West&#10;&#10;The first player ( chosen randomly ) will then place a card some where on that 5 x 5 grid. Next they will place a double sided token on the card marking that they own it, with the color of their choosing facing up. They will then draw a card from the deck, signaling the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;The next player will then go, doing the same thing.&#10;&#10;Players may also rotate the card however they desire to get the optimal outcome.&#10;&#10;If a player lays a card next to a card they do not own they can potentially take ownership of it and possibly cards next to that one and so forth!&#10;&#10;Using the example below the second player, who is represented by the black token laid their card to the right of one of the first players cards, who is represented by the white token.&#10;&#10;The card they laid down has a 7 on the west face of the card. The card to the left of it has a 0 on the east face of the card. Since 7 is greater than 0 the player represented by the black token can gain control of that card,&#10;&#10;But wait it doesn't end there! There is also the possibility of chain reaction captures! Lets examine the sample below.&#10;&#10;The card with the black token on it was just laid down by the second player, the number facing west is 3, the number on the card beside it that is owned by the first player has a number of 1 on the east side. Since 3 is greater than 1 it captures it.&#10;&#10;But it doesn't end there! Since the difference between 3 and 1 is 2 the second player, represented by the black token card capture up to two cards total ( including the initial card captured ) if there are numbers on the next card that are greater than cards it is next too and that the second player doesn't already own. The ending result is as seen below.&#10;&#10;Using this mechanic, even if you are woefully behind a single card can potentially bring you back in to the game!&#10;&#10;There are many strategic ways to play Onami, but you must be careful to be both defensive and offensive&#10;&#10;"

While a round progresses or after multiple rounds the suspense builds up at the table. Is the other team on to your cards? Did they discover your signal? Or are you quick enough to lead your team to victory?!&#10;&#10;Sign is ideally played in social settings such as small get-togethers and caf&eacute;s because a match is very short. The goal of Sign is to collect five cards with the same symbol. If a player has collected all five cards (s)he tries to stealthy signal his/her teammate(s) who, if they notice, will call out his/her name and score a point. Players of other teams can also spot your signal or payed attention to your cards and can also call you out at any time! If they are right, it will earn them the points! As you play multiple rounds, tension gradually rises and the pace of the game quickens.&#10;&#10;Sign can be described as a mix of Poker and Set because of the card design and social interaction.&#10;&#10;Sign is the new name of the game Tamps, which was the original name when kickstarted.&#10;&#10;Sign is a further development of the public domain game: Kemps/Camps.&#10;&#10;"

Meanwhile other players are trying to do the same thing to you.&#10;&#10;After sending your ship to sea, you can play Blacksmith cards to increase your cannons or decrease another players cannons, Carpenter cards to increase your strength or decrease another players strength. Draw an Attack Card and then destroy an opponent's ship (if you can). When a ship is sunk, receive gold which can be spent at The Market on Witch Doctor Cards so you can curse your opponent's ships. Buy some Fortune Teller Cards to protect yourself from others placing Witch Doctor Cards on your ships.&#10;&#10;Summon a Sea Creature to attack other player's ships. Force two other players to attack each other. Anything you can do to destroy your enemies and become the ruler of the seas.&#10;&#10;Use a Spy to remove useful cards from other players or a Thieving Monkey to take a card from an opponent and keep it. Better keep a good watch on your gold with a Guard or someone may try to steal it with a Thief.&#10;&#10;Lower the prices at the Market so you can buy more items or close the Market so your opponents cannot buy items to hurt you with.&#10;&#10;Once you have several ships at your command, use the Armada Card to join them all together and fight as one to destroy your enemies.&#10;&#10;Force your opponents to Walk The Plank or strand them on an island so they lose a turn.&#10;&#10;The play is simple. Draw 1 card, play 1 card (some cards can alter this). Play a ship, increase your ship, decrease another players ship, open/ close a market, steal cards or if you draw an attack card then attack a player with your ship. Receive gold and buy items to make you stronger or hurt your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each expansion pack adds more things you can do and more markets to buy from to help you on your quest to rule the seas.&#10;&#10;The main game includes 350 cards. There are 6 expansion packs ranging from 50 to 100 cards each. Each expansion pack adds a new level of play to the game.&#10;&#10;The first expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- The Magic Shop&quot; adds a Magic Shop full of things to help your ships and hurt your enemies.  Double your ships cannons or strength, reincarnate ships, confuse where a ship attacks, and some main deck cards like Royal Navy to attack all ships and Hurricanes.&#10;&#10;The second expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Raise The Dead&quot; adds bigger ships, cards to steal Magic Shop cards, more Sea Creatures, larger Royal Navy, Raise the Dead cards, Duplicate a ship, Spirit of Good Fortune, Eliminate Cards and Sails of Invisibility.&#10;&#10;The third expansion pack of 50 cards &quot;Pirate Attack- Miss-Direction&quot; adds more Ships, more Sea Creatures, Whirlpools, Windstorms, Stranded On An Island, Exploding Cannons, and Miss Direction.&#10;&#10;The forth expansion pack of 100 cards and 2 Dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Walk The Plank&quot; adds another Ship, Walk The Plank, The Trap, Smoke Screen, Power Play, The Magician, Damn Pirates, Insurance, Ship Bonus, Card Bonus, Into The Sea, Davy Jones Locker, End Of The World, Force Fields, Visions, Return To Port and The Gambler.  So many more ways to mess with other players.&#10;&#10;The fifth expansion pack of 100 cards and 1 Chip &quot;Pirate Attack- The Tavern&quot; adds a whole new market. The Tavern is a place where you can bribe a drunk sailor into telling you secrets and info, some good, some bad.  Get Double Play, Sneak Thief, Pick Pockets, add cannons and strength to all of your ships, give away your hand, make someone lose their gold, mix all cards and re-deal, give all ships a Witch Doctor, hurt another player with minus cannons and strength to all their ships.&#10;&#10;The sixth expansion pack of 50 cards and 2 dice &quot;Pirate Attack- Special Abilities&quot; gives players (who chose to) a Special Ability, but only if they are willing to Sell Their Soul to get it.  Get a bad item like no ships bigger than 7/7, overcharged at markets, no gold when killing a ship.  But then get a good item like Black Market, The Vault, or Money Master.  This deck also includes The Blockade so you can stop cards from being played and 20 new ships with abilities.&#10;The main game can be played as a stand alone and expansion packs can be added to give the players more things to do during the game. Best when played with 3 to 10 players. Ages 8 and up.&#10;This is a high quality game. It comes in a nice, sturdy 9&quot; x 12&quot; x 3&quot; game box with plastic insert to hold all the cards from the main game and each expansion pack, so all the cards are together. Expansion pack boxes can be folded and placed under the plastic insert for keeping.&#10;&#10;The game has great replay ability. Not the same old game every time. Certain cards make things different every game. You can even remove cards to give the game a different play. Play with or without expansion packs.  You can play to a certain number of Fame Points, play for a specified amount of time and most Fame Points at that time wins or play all the cards and go for last ship standing wins.&#10;&#10;"

And the battles fought for this prize are a record of the changing face of how war was fought.&#10;&#10;At the start of the 'war', the main forces were mounted men-at-arms and a tightly packed and closed formation of pike, especially as represented by the Swiss. But as battle churned into battle, that slowly changed. Firepower, in the form of the arquebus (an early musket) became increasingly prevalent and dominant, forcing the closed pike formations to open up, as the Spanish did (with sword and buckler), and the reliance on heavily mounted cavalry to decrease.&#10;&#10;&quot;Arquebus&quot; shows all of this in true die-rolling glory, featuring 8 major battles: Fornovo, Cerignola, Agnadello, Ravenna, Marignano, Bicocca, Pavia, and Ceresole. These are all really great game-players, with all but two of them half-mappers playable in 3 hours or less. The other two are the 'tiny' page-sized (8&quot; x 11&quot;) Cerignola and the big one-mapper, the major, final battle of Pavia. Pavia was a crushing defeat wherein France lost over 50% of its army and almost all of its nobility of command, including her king, Francis I, who was captured. But for gamers, Pavia is wonderful gameplay, with units all over the greatly detailed map, much maneuver and many tough decisions to make.&#10;&#10;Arquebus uses the popular &quot;Men of Iron&quot; mechanics with much concentration on detail of weaponry, from the differences between closed formation and open, to the decline of the Swiss (pas d'argent? pas de Suisse), and the rise of the German Landsknecht, the major force in warfare of the era and, ironically, the best-dressed men in Europe. Yes, Landsknecht uniforms literally set the fashion trend at the time for the entire western world.&#10;&#10;"
