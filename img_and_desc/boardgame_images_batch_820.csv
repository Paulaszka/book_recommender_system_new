This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages, for use with a variety of rule systems, to be used together. The rules are simple enough that players who have not previously encountered them &ndash; including wargaming novices of any age &ndash; can be taught the basics in  fteen minutes or so and then learn the rest &ldquo;on the job&rdquo;. &quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;A new English Civil War set, called &ldquo;To the Strongest! For King and Parliament.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Battles fought using the TtS! rules can be fought with model soldiers, on a dining room table and won or lost in less than two hours. The rules also support huge battles, with several thousand figures and up to five players a side.&#10;&#10;A grid enables players to completely dispense with measurement, and so permits the game to move along at a cracking pace. Miniatures can be in any scale from 2mm to 5mmm and based for any of the common wargaming rules systems. To the Strongest! games use a unique activation system driven by either playing cards or chits. This system introduces uncertainty to a battle; in some turns a unit can move four or five times, and in others not even once. The same deck is used to resolve shooting and melee. No dice, whatsoever, need be rolled!&#10;&#10;The rules include terrain placement and points values to support those players who wish to play competitively. Numerous army lists can be downloaded, for free, from the BigRedBatShop.&#10;&#10;TtS! Rules are written in plain English, with appropriate diagrams, sample lists and many examples of play. They are copiously illustrated with pictures of battles and beautifully painted miniatures. They have proved popular with veteran and novice wargamers alike!&#10;&#10;The rules enable two or more players to fight battles on a tabletop to a conclusion usually in two hours or less.&#10;&#10;The book includes 78 pages of rules including army lists, diagrams and numerous images of beautifully painted wargames figures and battles.

Build your team of spies, informants, sleeper cells, whistle-blowers, and double-agents to infiltrate enemy targets. Steal agents from your opponents, call upon underworld contacts. Do what you must to ensure your forces are stronger than your enemy's.&#10;&#10;As a set collecting game, the obvious goal of Under Cover is to gather the largest sets of cards -- larger sets of cards laid down scores more points. But, each card also has a special ability, which allows you to do special actions, such as drawing more cards, stealing from opponents' sets, forcing your opponent to draw cards (to put them over the hand limit), or taking cards from the &quot;Veterans Pile&quot; (the set of cards that have already been spent for their special abilities). On your turn, you may draw cards, then you'll decide how you want to act. You can lay down cards to score points, discard cards to make room in your hand, or play special ability cards. All of the cards are special ability cards. Under Cover even requires special ability cards to pick up a set from the table, so you can add to it.&#10;&#10;Each game begins with a simple shuffling of the deck. That's all the setup required, so the 15-30 minute play time is entirely playing. The cleanup at the end of the game is just as simple: put the cards back in the box. The Solo mode of the game is just as simple as the multiple-player mode, but it becomes more of a puzzle game -- instead of trying to get more points than the other player(s), you have to score large enough sets in ALL the color groups. That is impossible without using the abilities on the cards in a tactical manner.&#10;&#10;Under Cover has strategic choices to make, but it's a quick game that sets up in moments, and can be put away in seconds. It can be taught in five minutes, but can be played over and over -- with a quick shuffle, you're back in the game. It works as a great filler, or a fun game to play with your kids.&#10;&#10;"

These cards are their pack of dinos. Players take turns successively replacing these cards from the deck or discard pile until one player is satisfied with their pack and knocks.

To make peace, Woodrow Wilson (United States), David Lloyd George (United Kingdom), and Vittorio Orlando (Italy) were hosted by President George Cl&eacute;menceau (France) in Paris, and sat down to write what would become the Versailles Treaty. The treaty was signed on June 28, 1919, after six months of acrimonious debate and bargaining between the great powers.&#10;&#10;Versailles 1919, created by designers Mark Herman and Geoff Engelstein, allows you to experience this piece of history as one of the four leaders with a national agenda that must be satisfied. As one of the Big Four, you sit in a conference room gaining influence on the issues present in the room. In the waiting room sit other issues and personages who are waiting their turn to make their case to meet regional aspirations such as self-determination. Will you support Ho Chi Minh's attempt to free Vietnam from French colonialism? Help Prince Feisal establish a new nation in Mesopotamia or Chaim Weitzmann create a Zionist state? Work with T. E. Lawrence to reduce unrest in the Middle East or with Ataturk in Anatolia?&#10;&#10;As France, you are concerned with containing future German aggression while aligning with the British on reparations to pay for the destruction of the war. The British, however, would like to see Germany restored as a trading partner while preserving their empire against the global aspiration for self-determination. Italy wants territorial concessions from the former Austro-Hungarian empire. Lurking in the background is the threat of Bolshevism. Towering above it all is President Woodrow Wilson with his fourteen points that set global expectations soaring, ultimately ending in disappointment when the U.S. does not join the League of Nations.&#10;&#10;Versailles 1919 introduces a new card-bidding mechanism in which you use your influence to settle issues aligned with your agenda while keeping domestic constituents in support of your actions. You need to balance the need to demobilize your military forces while simultaneously keeping regional unrest under control. All of these decisions are set against the backdrop of regional crises and uprisings. The player who writes more of the treaty prevails in this contest of wills and national agendas. Can you save the world from the rise of nationalism? Can you make a better world while satisfying your domestic electorate? Play Versailles 1919 and relive making the flawed peace that was the Treaty of Versailles.&#10;&#10;"

Only in the territories leading to Madrid and to the south were the Nationalists thwarted, but at an increasingly bloody cost. The Soviet Union sent massive amounts of weaponry and equipment, while volunteers poured in from throughout Europe, the US and Canada to support the Republican cause. The leadership of the Republican military decided to launch a counter-attack against the Nationalists that were deployed directly west of Madrid. The plan was to attack from the Republican held northern salient to take the crucial town of Brunete, and the main highway leading to Madrid to its south. Success here would compel the fascists to withdraw from the territory closest to the national capitol, and give the Republicans a badly needed victory. One of the largest battles of the war to-date was about to unfold.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

They choose whether to build track, place station tokens, which trains to run on which routes, whether to pay or withhold dividends and whether to invest in more trains, etc.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met:&#10;Immediately, if the first stock round ends with nothing sold.&#10;&#10;At the end of the operating round in which a company&rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.&#10;&#10;At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which a major company&rsquo;s stock market value reaches the game end value of the stock market.&#10;&#10;At the end of the first operating round following a stock round in which the bank runs out of money.  The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.&#10;&#10;When the bank runs out of money in an OR, complete the pair of ORs and then run one additional OR (for a total of 3 ORs in the final set). The game still ends at that point even if the bank later becomes solvent. The bank continues to pay demands due of it even when broken; players should record these, or each lend the bank some money.&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s total wealth is the value of their stock, at current prices, plus cash on hand. Concession certificates, if they are still open and held by players, count face value. Private  company certificates and company assets count for nothing. The richest player wins.&#10;&#10;"

One unused die face may also be incremented or decremented by one.  If no sevens are rolled, one die face must be replaced by a miss token; one other showing face may still be incremented or decremented.  Once three miss tokens are placed, the game is over; the victory point faces are totaled.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"
