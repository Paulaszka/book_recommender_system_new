Your role is to lead humanity&rsquo;s charge into a bright new future.&#10;&#10;Every player selects one of the four types of laboratories. You may play as a Government Lab, a Corporation Lab, a University Lab, or an Innovator Lab. Each one offers asymmetrical powers to use to your advantage.&#10;&#10;While running the Lab, you will have the chance to purchase different Equipment made available every round. Your choice of equipment will be influenced by each piece&rsquo;s ability and its cost in funds. Your equipment will also indirectly affect your order of play during every round.&#10;&#10;Most importantly, you will be able to use your funds to hire legendary inventors like Tesla, Marie Curie, or Einstein himself! Every inventor has their own unique abilities that might just give you the edge against your opponents.&#10;&#10;Then you need to conceive of the right invention from the inventions offer by spending your most valuable resource, &ldquo;Ideas.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;To complete each invention, you will need to spend the necessary scientific resources (physics, chemistry, or engineering) required by the particular invention. Use your lab assistants as workers and place them on the locations available to research and gather these resources. These locations can either be on your lab or with the inventors you and your opponents have placed on the board. Then, all you need to do is to find an available inventor to invent your invention. Unsurprisingly, you will need an engineer for an engineering invention and so on.&#10;&#10;By completing inventions, you not only gain their unique instant ability, but you also advance humanity&rsquo;s progress in different tracks: Industrial, Economic, and Academic. The player whose laboratory contributes the most to society will be crowned the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;However, there is much more than meets the eye. You may gain secret victory points by cleverly placing inventions on the board and gaining Breakthrough Tokens, or gather experiments to fulfill. There is also the Ingenuity rank that affects most parts of the game where you may advance, but at a cost.&#10;&#10;Experience a strongly replayable game with a different pattern of inventors and inventions created every time. Breaking News cards spice up the game by altering the rules of each round just a bit to make it more interesting.&#10;&#10;Age of Inventors combines Worker Placement and Action Selection mechanics with an interesting blend of asymmetrical power use from your Lab and Inventors, and eventually tile placement of Inventors and Inventions. It is a fast and intense, highly replayable game that is equally enjoyable as a family game or as a competitive euro game for the most demanding gamer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Whoever is first has the right to choose the exit point before others, but whoever makes the first move is the player who came in second and so on.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;On their turn, each player may move along the paths in 2 different ways:&#10;1) Along the asphalt streets (gray): they may move 1 square at a time, ahead or to the sides.&#10;2) Along the fast bike lanes (brown): 2 squares at a time, ahead or to the sides.&#10;Each player may make their move and collect the die at the door with a number equal to the die in the center.&#10;In this case, the Player has reached door #3 of the green house and may collect the die with number 3.&#10;&#10;CHOOSING THE DICE&#10;You must choose and collect dice, trying to pick up those which will provide the best total, and find the best trajectory to take them to their destination.&#10;Choices must take into consideration the number and color of the dice, which grants special features to each of their number:&#10;-  Blue - Increase the number on the die by 1 (+1); &#10;-  Red - Reduce the number on the die by 1 (-1); &#10;-  Green - Allows an extra move (&gt;1); &#10;-  Orange - Double the number of the next die to be picked up (x 2).  &#10;Dice that are collected go to each player's marker on the TALLY CHART.&#10;&#10;END OF THE FIRST STAGE&#10;When a player reaches any position of the 4th column - where there is a traffic light in the middle of the game board - the first stage of the game ends.&#10;All the dice to the left of that column are removed and rolled again, completing the 12 squares of the second stage, from the 5th to the 8th column.&#10;Players keep their current position and game resumes with the next player after the one who first reached the middle of the game.&#10;&#10;IMPORTANT DETAILS&#10;Picking up 2 dice&#10;In some cases, a player's  movement will allow them to pick up 2 dice (or more):&#10;- When they pick up a green die and make an extra move, they may pick up a second die;&#10;- If they reach a square in which both door numbers allow them to pick up both dice;&#10;- On the fast lane, if they move 2 squares and pass by doors with the same numbers of the dice, they may pick up both.&#10;Extra movement&#10;Picking up 2 green dice only allows for 1 extra move. On the fast lane, picking up a green die also provides an extra move (i.e., a third move).&#10;Changing direction&#10;If a player wants to change direction during the game, they may spend one action/movement to make that inversion.&#10;Doubled dice&#10;The player who picked up an orange die will pick that one with its normal value and double the next die - even if that just happens on the next round. The die with doubled value will go to the gray area of dice tally.&#10;Blocking&#10;A player may not occupy the same square as another player. To move, they must go in a different direction. A player may also choose not to move.&#10;Movement from the brown lane to the gray lane&#10;When leaving the brown lane to the gray lane, a player doesn't lose the second movement. It may be performed in the gray area. To have a second movement in the brown area, the first movement must be in that lane as well.&#10;&#10;ENDING THE GAME&#10;To end a game, each player must have picked up at least 1 die of each color.&#10;When a player reaches one of the arrival points, the game ends, and the other players may still play their last turn.&#10;Besides the scoring from the dice, some Bonuses* may also be acquired by players:&#10;- First in Stage 1 (+2 points);&#10;- First in the Final Stage (+2 points);&#10;- Player with the most dice (+3 points).&#10;&#10;The total sum of dice and bonuses determines the winner. If they are tied, the winner is the player who collected the most dice.&#10;&#10;"
