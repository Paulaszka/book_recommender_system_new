Board game , inspired by Trevi Fountain, is a good game for family which uses simple calculation. &#10;2. You have to play &lsquo;fountain cards&rsquo; to reach specific &lsquo;lucky number&rsquo; and get &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo;.&#10;3. Recommendations: Ages 8+ (Simple addition and subtraction ability is required.), 2~5 Players, 20~30 Min. to play.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;1. Fountain cards: 80 Cards&#10;2. Starting cards: 4 Cards&#10;3. Round cards: 15 Cards&#10;4. Lucky token: 40 Tokens&#10;5. Highest combo card: 1 Card&#10;&#10;Preparations&#10;1. Put 4 starting cards on the board side by side. Number &lsquo;7&rsquo; is written on starting cards. &#10;2. Shuffle fountain cards well and distribute 7 cards to each player. You should NOT show off your own cards to others.&#10;3. Make a deck with remaining cards. &#10;4. Gather all lucky tokens in one place.&#10;5. Shuffle 15 round cards and select random 5 cards to build round deck. Only 5 chosen cards will be used in this game.&#10;6. Show off the top card of round deck. Check the written number of token and place lucky tokens of that number next to round card.&#10;7. Start the game. The person who see fountain most recently is the first player.&#10;&#10;There has ONLY 2 options! Play or Draw!&#10;On your turn, there has 2 options. &#10;Play the cards to earn points or Draw the cards to fill your hands. After that, your turn is over.&#10;&#10;Action #1. Play the card(s). (Color match or Number match)&#10;Play the card(s) of your hand on the board.&#10;To do so, you must match color or number with current base card.&#10;Every time you play a card, current base card will be replaced to the last card you play. &#10;(In other words, base card will be changed every time you play a card.)&#10;You can play card again and again if color or number is same with replaced base card. Regardless of sign, number is matter. (&lsquo;-4&rsquo; and &lsquo;4&rsquo; are &lsquo;number matched&rsquo; in this game.)&#10;You cannot play cards on multiple area. You can only play ONE sequence of cards.&#10;&#10;Point!&#10;Current base card changes every time someone plays a card to last played card. You can play cards again and again if color or number is matched.&#10;Because starting cards is &lsquo;7&rsquo; and there has no &lsquo;7&rsquo; in fountain cards, the first play must be &lsquo;color match&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Action #2. Draw the cards. (Draw 2 cards from deck)&#10;You don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t play card(s), draw 2 cards form deck to hand. &#10;All player can hold cards up to 7. If you are holding more cards, discard any card(s) to make 7 cards in your hand. Discarded card(s) will not be used in this game.&#10;&#10;To get &lsquo;Lucky Token&rsquo;&hellip;!?&#10;Round card shows 2 information, &lsquo;Lucky number&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lucky token&rsquo;. &lsquo;Lucky number&rsquo; is goal of this round.&#10;&lsquo;Lucky token&rsquo; is reward of this round. &#10;After player finishes card playing, add all number from base card to last card. If result is same with &lsquo;lucky number&rsquo; of this round, that player can earn &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; per each card that he (or she) plays.&#10;Even though player plays more cards than remaining token, player can earn remaining &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; only.&#10;Before end of turn, put together all cards that player plays and put the last card on the top of pile to notice what is current base card. &#10;When all &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; is distributed of this round, show off next top card of round deck and place written number of &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Point!&#10;Strategically, play as many cards as possible to earn more and give as less earning chance as possible to others.&#10;&#10;The end of game&#10;When all &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; of 5 rounds is distributed, the game ends immediately. &#10;If you are holding cards at the end of the game, that gives you a penalty.&#10;Discard your &lsquo;lucky token&rsquo; per each card you have. &#10;Who has token most is the winner of this game.&#10;&#10;Point!&#10;You have to manage your fountain cards if you think end is coming!&#10;&#10;"

Myraclia is a strategy game to be enjoyed on many occasions with many different people...&#10;&#10;Rudy Priecinsky, Designer of Myraclia&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;Planet Myraclia. Deserted and inhospitable. Wildly controlled by the elements. Life has no place here...&#10;&#10;But you came! With your divine powers. You know, or more precisely, you want to turn Myraclia...to a dreamed planet full of life. The task is not easy. You have to subdue chaotic elements of nature, organize them, establish order, to give life a chance...&#10;&#10;But you are not alone. Others want to turn Myraclia into their picture. Resources and time are limited. If you want to think of Myraclia as your creation, you have to fight with others ruthlessly for resources, but the form of Myraclia as well.&#10;&#10;Your goals are noble. But are your motives?&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;In the game, you compete with other players for the title of The Creator of Myraclia. You are trying to get limited and chaotically emerging elements and sources of life. These are represented by glittering cubes in 7 colors in uneven numbers. You have to get them, organize them correctly, possibly replace them with the other player's elements, and ..... a miracle! The desolate and inhospitable part of Myraclia changes into a beautiful cradle of life.&#10;&#10;The Myraclia surface is divided into hexagonal tiles. One side of the tile represents the original look of Myraclia, before the transformation, without life, the other side of the terraformed appearance, the new beautiful face of Myraclia full of greenery. There are 4 types of surfaces, namely plains, forests, water areas, and mountains.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in rounds, divided into two basic phases.&#10;&#10;In the first &ndash; drafting phase &ndash; players alternate in the specified order and select one element (cube) from the drafting board to help them transform (re-shape) a part of the planet in the next phase. But remember. Not the same resources are available in each round. Those elements, which were abundant in the last round and nobody wanted them, can now be scarce and desirable. And vice versa. The price for gaining a rare element is great. Speed - and sometimes greed &ndash; during elements selection determine the player order for an important second phase.&#10;&#10;In the second phase - the terraformation - the players, according to the order set in the first phase, turn the individual deserted parts of the planet into Myraclia full of life. They discard the elements displayed on the Myraclia tile and turn it to a terraformed side. In most parts, they instantly earn points and/or a bonus in the form of the free released element. A released element can be used immediately. Order is key, but the first position does not necessarily mean an absolute advantage. If you were greedy in the first phase or you have chosen the wrong combination of elements, other players in turn could exchange their elements for your unused elements. The reward for the conversion of Myraclia is, in addition to the points, also the right to reveal new parts of the planet (by choosing new Myraclia tiles from the offer).&#10;&#10;The game ends in a round in which any player has terraformed 7 parts of Myraclia planet or if a certain part of the planet has been terraformed (i.e. it is not possible to replenish the offer of Myraclia tiles).&#10;&#10;Until the last moment, you cannot be sure who gets the title of The Creator of Myraclia.&#10;&#10;At final scoring, players are rewarded by the final look of the planet Myraclia and receive a bonus for the most consecutive terraformed area of the planet, for the variety of the terraformed surface, but also for the size of individual types of surfaces terraformed by the player.&#10;&#10;Your reward is a brand new Myraclia, beautiful, full of life. And also the feeling that you have contributed to it ..... the most.&#10;&#10;"

If the drawn challenge card cannot be played (for example, none of the players has a tattoo), treat this card as a freestyle card.&#10;&#10;Next all players &mdash; including the one who drew the card or chose the part to measure &mdash; secretly estimate the measurement. The players choose one of their number cards and play it face down on the table. The players can also answer by playing 2 number cards and their values are added together.&#10;Example: 17 + 30 = 47&#10;&#10;Once all players have played a number card face down, the cards can be revealed.&#10;The initial player measures the body part or object. The player who guessed the number closest to the real size or length wins the challenge card.&#10;&#10;Example: the correct answer is 35. If one player answered 38 and one player answered 30, the player with the 38 wins this turn.&#10;&#10;ENDING TURNS:&#10;The used number cards are discarded in a pile and all players refill their hands so they have 10 cards. The players draw 1 number card if they played 1 number card, or they draw 2 number cards if they played 2 number cards. If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile.&#10;&#10;The game continues clockwise (the player to the left of the first player draws the next challenge card, and so on).&#10;&#10;VICTORY:&#10;The first player to collect 5 challenge cards wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;The concept of Size Up is simple: Estimate the length of your grandmother's little finger, the width of your train ticket, or the circumference of a carrot. The tape measure is used to check the estimates afterwards. Whoever has the best sense of proportion wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.&#10;    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.&#10;    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.&#10;    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.
