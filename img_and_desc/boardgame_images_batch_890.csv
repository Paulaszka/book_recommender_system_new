Most zombie games are expensive, take all night to play, have tons of miniatures, require a whole bunch of friends to play and you all are good guy Survivors. This game is the opposite. It's inexpensive, uses only cards and counters, and can be played solo or with two people in 20-40m. Best of all, one of the players gets to be the zombies! If you're tired of being the hero, this is the game for you! Players need to complete their turn in 30 seconds or forfeit the rest of their planned actions. This is tracked using a companion app downloaded from the 30 Seconds To Live website, or with the included sand timer. This forces players to think and act quickly. Nobody likes it when a player takes ten minutes to decide what they want to do on their turn. Do you think zombies are going to wait for you to decide whether to move, draw a card, or attack? They will just attack! Finally, health and ammo are tracked using a simple mechanism that eliminates the need for dice and other counters and makes for faster and simpler gameplay. The game includes male and female versions of eight unique player characters, eight types of zombies, and 19 different weapons.

The Czech became known for his work in 1894 when famous actress Sarah Bernhardt invited him to produce the poster for the play Gismonda.&#10;&#10;From then on, Mucha started producing other posters and advertisements of various products, always emphasizing its most striking features. Her style drew attention because it portrayed with emphasis the feminine forms, in a kind of Byzantine mosaic that plays with colors and floral arabesques.&#10;&#10;In La Muse, we bring a gallery of 20 works by Alphonse Mucha to compose the game cards, produced between 1897 and 1902.&#10;&#10;In the game, we are collectors looking for the most beautiful and valuable works of Alphonse Mucha.

Storms of Steel covers one of the largest tank battles in history. German Panzer and Anti-Tank hardware had caught up with the Soviets, allowing the Germans to destroy most Soviet tanks from great distances. But the Soviets countered this advantage with mass production of tanks, which were thrown at the Germans in an attempt to overwhelm them.&#10;&#10;Storms of Steel! is the second stand-alone title in the best selling Conflict of Heroes series. Each game in the series uses the same core rules system, so it's easy to advance from one game to the next! Conflict of Heroes is a tactical war game of platoon-sized engagements, with each counter representing a squad of infantry, a crewed gun, or a vehicle. The engagements are presented as firefights with different objectives. During a firefight, players use their army's units to fight for these objectives, which are worth victory points (VPs). The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;The rules for Storms of Steel are the same as for Awakening the Bear, but the two games play very differently. In Awakening the Bear, the Germans had to flank and get close to Soviet tanks if they stood any chance of penetrating the heavy T-34 tank armor. But by 1943, at the battle of Kursk, most Soviet tank armor could be penetrated by the Germans at great distances. So the tables are turned and players must employ very different tactics.&#10;&#10;All New for the 3rd Edition:&#10;&bull;Featuring the latest 3rd Edition Conflict of Heroes Rules!&#10;&bull;Updated the maps and overlay artwork to be highly detailed and more beautiful than the original!&#10;&bull;All new counters in addition to new versions of the previous counters!&#10;&bull;New box format, with updated tray inserts designed by Game Trayz!&#10;&#10;Please note:  There was never a second edition released.

It also uses the piece-entering mechanism of games like 9tka (Adam Ka&#197;&#130;u&#197;&#188;a).&#10;&#10;EQUIPMENT&#10;&#10;12 &lsquo;ice&rsquo; discs, 12 black discs, board, carrying case, 2 small blue discs (king indicators).&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY (please refer to rulebook for detailed rules)&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns entering one of the perimetral discs into the 6x6 inner area of the board. One or more discs may be pushed forward as a result.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the largest group of connected discs of her color wins the game.&#10;&#10;ADVANCED GAME MODES:&#10;&#10;Omega Scoring: The same score as in the game OMEGA (by the same designer) is applied.&#10;&#10;Kings mode: One or two pieces per player (indicated by a blue disc on top) are worth 2 points.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The base rules are freely available, and the game was conceived to be played before or during a tabletop role playing session, while everyone has their dice out.&#10;&#10;Using their dice, which represent six heroes with unique abilities and one mighty dragon, players attempt to defeat their opponents' heroes to control battlefields and score points. Dice have varying levels of power, that, combined with their abilities, encourage strategic play and positioning as well as carefully thought-out risk taking.&#10;&#10;All-in-all, Heroes of Hedra is a quick, fun game that can be played many times in a sitting, or as single quick game to pass the time, but has more strategy than one might expect.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
