Players draw from a common deck and race to create enough celestial objects into their area of space to complete a common goal, which takes the form of a randomly selected Galaxy card. Once the goal is achieved by any player, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Players start with 5 cards and draw 2 cards beginning each turn. Every card in the game is multiple use; play, resource payment or special discard ability. Cards are played from hand by discarding payment but each card a player controls will also generate a resource token during their turn which may be used for playing cards. The more a player controls the more powerful they become thus making it easier to play more cards.&#10;&#10;This game is about choices and sacrifice. And with many circumstantial abilities and effects the replay value is very great. There is also a planned expansion in the works.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The novelty of this game lies in its central gimmick: Every move consists in moving a stack. In this sense it is a pure movement game. Yet, the game features both placement and captures.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;The game is for 2 players and is played with stackable pieces of two colors on a hexagonal arrangement of hexagons (a hexhex board). The board starts out empty. The game is over as soon as one player is unable to make a move. The other player is then the winner.&#10;&#10;Movement &ndash; overview: &#10;Stacks move along straight open lines and grow when they move away from the center cell. This game is unusual in allowing movement of stacks containing 0 pieces. It is by growing these that pieces get onto the board in the first place.&#10;&#10;Movement &ndash; details: &#10;On your turn, you must move a stack not topped by an enemy piece to an empty cell reachable through an unbroken line of empty cells. By convention, a single piece is considered a stack of size 1 and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.&#10;&#10;If, after you have moved a stack, it is farther away from the center cell than before it was moved (measured in number of steps), its size is increased by 1 per step further away from the center it now is. This is effected by adding pieces to the top of it from your hand.&#10;&#10;You may move a proper part of a stack by splitting it.  That is, if a stack contains several pieces you can choose to only move the top n pieces, given that you do not change their order, for any number n less than the number of pieces in the stack.&#10;&#10;You may also move a whole stack, but only on the condition that you move it farther away from the center cell. A consequence is that moving a whole stack always results in its size increasing. Together with the convention that empty cells contain stacks of size 0, this also has the consequence that you can effectively place a new stack on the board by moving a stack of size 0.&#10;&#10;Note that nothing special happens to the cell you moved the 0-stack from &ndash; it still contains a 0-stack.&#10;&#10;Capturing &ndash; overview: &#10;Flanked enemy stacks are captured by being taken hostage for a move. Capturing is obligatory: If a capturing move is available, a capturing move must be made.  The winner will be the player who manages to force their opponent to capture an immovable stack.&#10;&#10;Capturing &ndash; details: &#10;If (and only if) the top piece of a stack is of your color, it is said to partake in flanking an enemy stack if (i) this enemy stack is exactly in the middle of a line of otherwise empty cells going from the flanking stack to another one of your stacks, and (ii) all three of these stacks are of the same size.&#10;&#10;If, after you have moved a stack, it partakes in flanking one or more enemy stacks, you must immediately move one of these enemy stacks. Except for the obvious difference that you are moving an enemy stack, all normal rules apply to this move. For example: If the captured stack grows (if you move it farther away from the center cell, that is), it grows by the addition of pieces of your color, so situations where this hostage move must itself be a capturing move are possible. Such chaining of captures must continue until you capture a stack that is not in a position to continue the chain. Growing captured stacks is the only way to take ownership of them more permanently.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

332493,,"Manhattan is a unification game that always ends with one player (the winner) gathering all their pieces in one group.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;The game is played on a 6x6 square board covered in a checkered pattern of pieces of two colors, except the the 4 central squares are empty. On your turn you have two options: Move or remove. If you cannot do either you automatically pass. (One player will always have a move.)&#10;&#10;&bull; Move:&#10;With one of your pieces that is not part of a group, take the first orthogonal step of the shortest possible walk along a clear path that leads to a friendly piece. That is: Of all clear paths to all friendly pieces, you must choose the one that consists of the smallest number of orthogonal steps, and reduce it by 1 orthogonal step.&#10;&#10;&bull; Remove:&#10;Remove one of your pieces that belong in a group of same-colored pieces. You may not make a removal that will split the group the removed piece was part of.&#10;&#10;"

But since everyone wants to win, there is of course the possibility of repeatedly putting a spoke in your fellow player's wheel. Action cards can be used to attack them and prevent someone else from playing their last card first.&#10;&#10;Up to this point, the principle sounds familiar to many, but in &quot;DOPPELT ODER NICHTS&quot; (German for &quot;DOUBLE OR NOTHING&quot;), some things work a little differently: For example, it is possible to defend yourself by deflecting the attack on a fellow player, who in turn has the same option to defend himself. In this way, it can hit anyone and you can never be sure to reach the goal without being disturbed.&#10;&#10;Constant action is therefore the order of the day and does not end with the cards. Those who are willing to take risks can, sometimes under full physical effort, gain an advantage in this card game. Through interactive, cognitive or coordinated tasks it is possible to prevent the drawing of penalty cards. However, one should then think twice, because whoever fails the task receives double the penalty. The deal is: &quot;DOPPELT ODER NICHTS&quot;.&#10;&#10;"
