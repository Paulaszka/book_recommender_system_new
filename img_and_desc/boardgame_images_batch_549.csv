The game is aimed at pre-schoolers and are designed to be attractive to young minds. There are numerous games suggested, mostly having a parent to act as referee.&#10;&#10;For example, the parent lays out 10 cards, one of each number. Then she asks the players in turn to point to two cards that add up to 7. If the child is right, he or she gets a point. After the playxers have all had a turn, the parent can choose a different number like 5 for instance, and so on. First to get, say, three points, wins. This sort of game can easily be made more difficult by choosing three cards that add up to a number.&#10;&#10;Nearly all the games feature counting and the recognition of numbers. The publisher has made a very good job of making the cards as nice and hard-wearing as they are.&#10;&#10;"

Wooden sticks are then put through holes in the plastic so that they cross the tower. Wooden ghosts (in black, white and orange) are put on top of the sticks.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;A six-sided number die is rolled to determine the start player. Players then take turns rolling a six-sided colour die. The active player has to remove a stick marked with the colour determined by the die roll.

If a ghost hits the floor, the player responsible loses a turn. Players keep the sticks they removed and any ghosts they caused to fall. At the end of the game, points are counted as follows: Each stick is worth one point. Each white ghost counts one minus point, orange ghosts two minus points and black ghosts 7 minus points.

She has to deliver the mail to the bear, the two lions and the three elephants, bring them food or paint the animal houses. And Dapdap, the penguin, has escaped from his enclosure and visits all his animal friends. Can you help Milly with her tasks and return Dapdap to his enclosure?&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;- 1 board&#10;- 18 tiles (9x food, 3x flags, 3x paint bucket, 3x letters)&#10;- 16 task tiles&#10;- 1 wooden &quot;Milly, the animal keeper&quot; token&#10;- 1 wooden &quot;Dapdap, the penguin&quot; token&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;For the basic variant, 6 food tiles are removed from the game. 3 food tiles (showing 1 honeypot, 2 pieces of meet, 3 lettuce heads) and flag, paint bucket and letter tiles are put close to the corresponding corners of the board. The task tiles are randomised and stacked face-down. Dapdap is placed on the penguin enclosure.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The start player takes the Milly token and puts it in front of him/herself to show it is his/her turn. He/she draws a task card. If it is a Milly card, he/she gets to help Milly. He/she looks which house (red, yellow or blue roof) Milly is running to and if she is delivering the mail, carrying the paint bucket, a flag, or if she is distributing food. He/she then looks for the correct tile at the board corners and puts it in the corresponding area on the board and gets to keep the task tile as a reward. &#10;&quot;Correct&quot; means: matching colour for the paint buckets, matching shape for the flags (shape on the flag has to match the shape of the animal enclosure), matching number for the letters, and matching food (honey for the bear, meat for the lions, lettuce heads for the elephants).&#10;If the tile drawn is a Dapdap card, the active player puts the Dapdap token to the next animal enclosure. Dapdap greets the animals in their language, so the player makes the corresponding sounds. For the correct greeting, they also get to keep the tile.&#10;After completing the task, Milly is given to the next player, whose turn then starts. Incorrectly completed tasks are put at the bottom of the task tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when Dapdap has returned to his enclosure or when all items have been distributed (players decide which of the two they prefer). The game is intended to be played cooperatively, without deciding on a winner (but it can be played competitively by counting how many tiles each player has earned).&#10;&#10;The advanced variant is played with all the food tiles and the players have to choose the tile showing the same number as food items as there are animals of that type, e.g. if Milly is going to feed the elephants, the player has to pick the food tile that shows three lettuce heads because there are three elephants.&#10;&#10;"

Admiral Karl D&ouml;nitz, commander of Germany&rsquo;s much-feared u-boat fleet, altered his strategy to bring the maritime war to America&rsquo;s east coast. Where once he relied on German submarines preying on supply convoys on the open Atlantic Ocean, now he deployed long-range Type-IX u-boats to prowl the American coastal waters along which freighters and tankers sailed to convoy assembly points in the Canadian maritime.&#10;&#10;Initially u-boat commanders took advantage of America&rsquo;s unprepared defenses, hunting easy targets with few patrols and even coastal cities lit up, ignoring wartime blackout precautions; but the Americans quickly mustered their forces for war, increasing their patrols by aircraft and destroyers and ultimately chasing the German u-boats from the East Coast and back into wolf pack formations to prowl the North Atlantic once again.&#10;&#10;Operation Drumbeat is a solitaire game in which a player assumes the role of a u-boat commander sent to hunt shipping along America&rsquo;s East Coast in early 1942. The player plots a course on a grid map like the ones used by German submarine captains to travel to the patrol area and hunt targets. A series of charts helps simulate the chances of running into American patrols, encountering freighters and tankers, and attacking them with torpedoes and deck guns. Each turn equals one day; the player tracks the u-boat&rsquo;s progress in a log much like actual German submarine captains used. How many ships can a captain sink before his u-boat runs out of torpedoes&hellip;or luck?&#10;&#10;"

There are 54 cards in four 'suits' of eleven and ten reserve cards. The 'suits' are four football teams - Red Rovers, Blue Devils, Green Goblins and Yellow Dwarfs. A team consists of 1 Goalkeeper, 2 Full Backs, 2 Half Backs and 5 Forwards.&#10;&#10;Each player receives an equal number of counters. At the start of every hand, a player must pay i unit into the Big Pool (a 'pot' that is taken by the winning player). Everyone then get five cards and can chooseto keep the hand or to discard any number of cards and receive replacements. Once this has been done for everybody, each player may discard the hand or support it. If he does indeed support it, he must pay three units into the Small Pool After everyone has had the chance to discard or support their hand, the hands left in are revealed and the winning player takes the Small Pool. The hands are valued as in Poker, except that it is possible to have five of a kind.&#10;&#10;The winning player of each hand may take from his winning hand any cards that he might be needing to form his team. For example, if he was collecting red players and he won the hand with cards Red Full Back x 2 and a red forward, he may take those three cards and lay them out in front of him. When any player has all 11 players of the same colour, he has won. Reserve team players can be in the team, substituting for actual red player cards.&#10;&#10;If you run out of units, you are out of the game. The player who first builds a complete team wins and takes the units in the Big Pool. The units seem only to be interesting if you are playing for real money.

When a set is complete, the first card will say a war-time real person's name. The second card will have a short rhyme without the last word and that word appears on the third card in the set (all the last words are illustrated by a food item, hence the name of the game). An example;&#10;General Gort (1st card)&#10;With his army in France, just in CASE,&#10;Our French pals need help to hold Nazis in (both lines 2nd card)&#10;PLAICE (3rd card)&#10;&#10;Sets like this help to date the game because France had not fallen at the time of printing. And other sets help as well. Neville Chamberlain was still Prime Minister for instance.&#10;&#10;The game mechanic is very much like Rummy card games. You draw and discard cards until you get a set. This is laid before you. The same applies to a second set but now you would be out of cards in your hand so then you have to spend three turns just drawing a new card each time. Once you are up to three cards in your hand, you can collect properly again.&#10;&#10;Each set has a point value on the card. In general, the British named character sets are worth between 10 and 20 points. The German characters are worth between 5 or 10 points. Hitler is 10, Goering only 5, for example. You might find it strange that Chamberlain is worth 20 but Churchill only 15. Churchill was not Prime Minister at the time of publication so was not worth the 20 you might have expected.&#10;&#10;The round ends when one player has three completed sets. That player collects the point value of each set (the rest score nothing) and a game will last until one player achieves a set score agreed upon at the start. The rules suggest 100 to 200 points.&#10;&#10;"

They will light corresponding numbers on the backglass. Try to get 3, 4, or 5 numbers in a row on the backglass cards.&#10;&#10;Numbers must be ADJOINING each other connected by a line. Only highest score per card registers.&#10;&#10;Coin 1: 5 balls on card 1&#10;&#10;Play as many (or as few) coins as you wish.&#10;&#10;Coins 2 - 6: lites Cards 2 thru 6.&#10;&#10;Coins 7 and 8: lites Diagonals on Cards 1, 2, 3 and Cards 4, 5, 6.&#10;&#10;Coins 9 and 10: lites a Magic Number for Cards 1, 2, 3 and Cards &#10;4, 5, 6.

Or, a coin might lite a playfield button to lite the CORNERS or SUPER LINE feature.&#10;&#10;After playing the 13th coin, you may (if you wish) play another coin and lite the Golden Star Game. Each coin increases the Golden Star Game odds. A maximum of 20 coins may be played. When lit, after shooting your first ball, five gold numbers will lite in a star pattern on one of the cards. Any 2, 3 or 4 in the Golden Star will score as indicated.&#10;&#10;After shooting the fifth ball, you may try to improve your game with 1 to 3 EXTRA BALLS. The maximum payoff on the next ball is shown, as well as the cost of an EXTRA BALL. (The higher the potential win, the greater the cost).&#10;&#10;"
