The Under Both Flags module is included and adds six scenarios, a scenario generator, and log sheets for the ships.

Sets of 1/1200 scale counters in PDF format are available separately for use instead of miniatures.&#10;&#10;Players may fight historical battles using one of the 6 scenarios provided or create their own using the scenario generator. Game length will vary depending on the number of ships used and scenario victory conditions. Most scenarios played at conventions with multiple players last 3 to 5 hours. &#10; The game uses D10s for resolving combat and other actions. Usually you will only need one or two dice but more will be required for most damage checks. D6 dice are used to record momentum for each ship. A player aid and a sheet of markers/templates will need to be printed out for use. As with most miniatures based systems any flat playing surface can be used and a ruler or measuring tape is required for checking range and movement.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is straightforward; it starts with writing speed orders for the turn (how fast the ship will go for the turn), followed by combat (cannon fire, musket fire, boarding/melee), then movement, and finally morale checks and repairs.&#10;&#10;"

In each round, players take turns in clockwise order until the round end is triggered (see ROUND END).&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may take any number of the following actions, in any order:&#10;&#10;     Play a kingpin (12) from your hand to start a new syndicate stack in an empty space on one of the four corner positions around the stockpile (NE, SE, NW, SW). &#10;     Play a card from your hand to any stack. The card you play must be the next lowest in rank, but opposite in color (e.g., You can play a red 10 on a black 11). &#10;     Move an entire stack onto any other stack. This is only possible if the bottom card of the stack being moved is one rank lower and opposite in color to the top card of another stack (e.g., a stack of R4-B3-R2 can be moved onto a stack of R6-B5). Recruitment stacks can be moved onto syndicate stacks, and vice versa.&#10;     Play any card from your hand to one of the original (N, S, E, W) recruitment stacks that has become empty.&#10;     Discard a femme fatale card to play a different card from your hand to the bottom of any stack. The card played must be one rank higher than the card currently on the bottom of the stack, and opposite in color. &#10;     Play a hideout to any stack. This is only possible if the top card of the stack is a 1 and opposite in color to the hideout. &#10;     When you play a card, resolve its special ability (if any) immediately. If the ability cannot be resolved, simply ignore it.&#10;&#10;&#10;If, after playing a card, you have none left in hand, the round ends. If you have cards left but cannot or do not want to take any more actions, end your turn by drawing a card from the stockpile.&#10;&#10;If the stockpile runs out during the round, continue to play as normal but do not draw.&#10;&#10;ROUND END&#10;The round will end either (a) when one player manages to get rid of all the cards from their hand or (b) when the stockpile has run out and all players have passed consecutively&mdash;whichever comes first.&#10;&#10;Score all cards remaining in your hand at the end of the round (taking all special abilities into account). The scoring value of each card is indicated in its bottom right corner. Add your score for the round to your running total.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;After the fifth round is complete, the game is over.

The design of the cards looks similar to Bohnanza in this respect.&#10;&#10;The difference is the way cards are distributed. The active player draws a hand of cards from the draw deck, drawing the number of players plus one. They choose an opponent and pass them a seed card face-down in secret. That player has three options: to either plant it face-up in their own field, or place it face-up in the Storehouse in front of the active player, or pass it face-down to another player who is still in the round (who then has the same options but cannot pass it back). Once a player plants a seed card in a field, they are out for the round. Eventually, all the other players will have planted a seed card, or added the seed card to a field with that crop. The active player is left to choose their seed card from what is left in their hand or what is in the Storehouse (which can store 2 cards). The remaining card is discarded. The turn passes left to the new active player.&#10;&#10;If a player has their two fields occupied, and has to plant a seed which does not match the two crops, they must harvest one crop. As well as the seed cards, there are manure cards which act as Jokers. Planted cards are staggered to show how many are in a field, so any Manure cards go at the back of the stagger.&#10;&#10;Play ends when the active player cannot draw enough cards to distribute. The player with the most money winds, ties are broken by owning the most of the rarest plants.&#10;&#10;So whilst Tanemaki has obvious connections to Bohnanza, the game play is calculated and based on hand management from the card draft, and no bartering is involved.&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition includes English rules.

ISIS intended to secure this border town to make it easier for their volunteers to enter Syria from Turkey. But, like many battles, it was a battle that need not to have occurred. ISIS volunteers had entered from Turkey from many crossing points but the one difference was its close proximity to the ISIS capital of Raqqa. It was that reason that ISIS decided to fight a more conventional battle this time. It seemed like a sure win as up to 4000 ISIS soldiers gradually descended upon the Kobani area along with some 25&#226;&#128;&#144;30 AFVs from captured Iraqi booty when Iraq allowed the city of Mosul to fall. These AFV's, American M1 and T&#226;&#128;&#144;72M were still formidable weapons even in inexperienced hands and add to this numerous artillery guns from war booty, and ISIS was almost assured a victory. But like at Stalingrad in WW2, where the Russians refused to be defeated, the Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) felt the same.

On a player's turn, another player chooses 1 of his cards and attacks the active player with the aggressive sentence on the Card. The player has to react in 5 seconds. The more positive he reacts (open for further discussions) the more Points he will get from the moderator.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the highest positive sum of points after 20 rounds, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Note: Although a player count of 8 and a card count of 120 doesn't seem to make sense (8 people would need 160 cards), the player range of 4-8 is given in the rules. No rule change for 7-8 players seems to have been provided.&#10;&#10;"

How many words can you make?

It comes with two-sided mats, offering two ways to play.&#10;&#10;Side one, the Shark Mat, has five different incomplete words, each with the first letter missing.  The letter tiles with consonants are placed in a pile face down.  Each player in turn chooses a tile and tries to complete one of the words on his or her mat with the letter.  If a word cannot be completed, the tile is returned to the pile face down.  The first player to complete all five words wins.&#10;&#10;Side two, the Ocean Mat, challenges players to make as many words as possible on their mats.  Each player starts by drawing an agreed number of starting red consonant tiles and yellow vowel tiles.  Players then work simultaneously to create as many words as possible on their mats.  Players may continue to draw or trade tiles from the center pile to continue making words.  (The rules do no specify how many tiles can be taken at a time).  Players can decide whether to make words individually or in crossword fashion.  The winner can be either the player who made the most words or the player who used the most tiles.&#10;&#10;"
