However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?&#10;&#10;Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.&#10;&#10;Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.&#10;&#10;In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose. Therefore, the storyteller should do her best to make the story confusing.&#10;&#10;"

Monsters may not be the scariest foes you face, though, as you will also be playing against other people who have the same goal as you: survival!&#10;&#10;Be assured that your &ldquo;friends&rdquo; will do whatever they can to protect themselves not only from the horde of monsters, but from any and all of the tricks that you may use throughout the game. At the end of the game, only one player&rsquo;s house will be left standing -- will it be yours?!&#10;&#10;Summary of play: Every turn has several steps including Action, Player, movement/combat, cleanup.&#10;&#10;In the action phase, an action card is flipped and there is a number indicating how many monsters enter the current player's field. Each monster has a lane indicator that tells the player which lane the monster will enter. The field itself is 5 rows by 4 lanes. If ever 2 monsters enter the same lane, the second one pushes the first one farther toward the player.&#10;&#10;In the player phase, the active player uses defenses and tricks to protect themselves or damage other player's fields. The active player always starts their player phase with 5 cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;In the movement phase, each monster moves down the field one tile. If they run into a defense, combat happens and either the monster or defense with the higher power wins combat.&#10;&#10;In the cleanup phase, players finish any effects that need to resolve, remove any defenses or monsters that have been destroyed in combat, and refill their hand up to 5 cards total.&#10;&#10;The player who is the last person standing is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up twelve buildings.&#10;&#10;This second edition of San Juan includes all the cards of the original game as well as the additional building cards from the alea Treasure Chest but not the event cards from that expansion. This edition also contains a new building card not previously available: &quot;The Hut,&quot; a building that grants a card when nothing is sold in the trader phase.&#10;&#10;"

England has built an extensive empire on which the sun never set, vastly extending its domain beyond the British Isles on the spur of the Plantagenets, a royal lineage that dominated much of medieval European history, a dynasty forged from steel and blood, a lineage that would prevail for more than half a millennium. Plantagenet is a name that inspires admiration among enemies and fear among allies.&#10;&#10;Henry II, the first Plantagenet king to extend and stabilize his domains, contracted a political marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, a marriage intended to generate heirs to the throne. This strategic alliance by marriage produced four heirs: children who would rebel against their own father, more than once, leading to war, bloodshed and pacification, the stuff history is made of.&#10;Who is going to inherit the throne? Who will prove to be worthy of the illustrious name of Plantagenet? After years of battles and rivalry, only two of the heirs survived.&#10;&#10;The first, opposed by his own father, is a man with a destiny marked out by his own land, which he rarely set foot on as he was preoccupied for his entire life in conquests beyond the British Isles. The hope of an entire era would depend on his choices. The difference between being the usurper or the chosen one would depend on his actions. He is Richard I of England, better known as Richard the Lionheart.&#10;The other, the last born, was far removed from the throne. Overshadowed by his own family, derided by his own people and saddled with the unfortunate title of &ldquo;Lackland&rdquo;, John Lackland had the opportunity of a lifetime: Richard left for the Crusades and John could claim the throne for himself in Richard&rsquo;s absence. But would he have the mettle of a king? Would he surpass his more illustrious brother Richard? Would he be able to counter his brother&rsquo;s supporters?&#10;&#10;A wise choice as to with whom to form an alliance is crucial to one&rsquo;s place in history. Only brave choices will crown the true king of England, and only those who loyally and valiantly supported him in the conquest and administration of the kingdom would be remembered in history. This is a choice that only the strong and the wise would make.This is history.&#10;&#10;In Richard I, the players assume the role of the characters who remained in England when King Richard I left for the Crusades. They have to decide which side to take without knowing whether Richard I will return home a victor with glory and riches, or he won't come back at all (but there are many possible intermediate outcomes).&#10;&#10;During the game, the players take turns to influence the different characters available in order to earn prestige points (PPs) for themselves, but also to use their powers to influence the Crusade from far away by sending resources. A player might even decide to betray his own side, if worrying news were to come from the East...&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the outcome of the Crusade leads to an increase of PPs for the players who were deployed by the faction which has achieved its goal, but the game has only one winner: the player who has accumulated the most PPs, regardless of the faction to which he belongs!&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to amass the most Prestige Points (PP) by wisely choosing alliances and exerting influence on the performance of the Crusade.&#10;&#10;"

In it he sets out to dispel the notion that patience is a therapeutic pastime for the simple-minded and the idle rich. Whereas previous compilations have tended to copy one another in jumbling good, bad, and indifferent games with no sense of order, the author has here adopted a systematic approach enabling the browser to pick out the type of game most appealing to his or her own taste and mood of the moment. Three major groups are distinguished. First come the attractive and simple games requiring care and patience to bring them out, then games requiring a balance of judgement and card sense and finally those which call for the type of positional analysis more usually associated with chess problems than card games. Each group is further subdivided in a way which generally proceeds from the small and simple to the large and complex.&#10;&#10;"
