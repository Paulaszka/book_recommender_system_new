The result was The Battle of the Bulge, a brutal struggle in a dismal winter landscape set against an enemy imbued with a fanatic conviction that victory could be snatched from defeat. It was the United States Army's greatest and fiercest battle of World War II. Over a million men and thousands of guns, tanks, and other fighting vehicles were engaged. In those &quot;Bitter Woods,&quot; fighting against heavy odds, the American soldier slowed and then stopped the spearhead of two elite Panzer Armies, forever emblazing themselves in the annals of military history.&#10;&#10;Compass Games presents the Designer Edition of this Charles S. Roberts and ORIGINS award nominee. New to this edition are updated unit counter graphics, additional scenarios, and an extended campaign game to allow the Allied counterattack to be fully realized. In addition to the 6 and 8 turn tournament games, Patton's famous relief of Bastogne can be recreated via scenario play. Specific rules include: Mechanized Exploitation Movement, Hidden Fuel Dumps, Leader Units, Reserves, Random Events, Bridge Demolition, Kampfgruppe Peiper Breakout, Skorzeny Infiltration, Air Power, and Artillery Support.&#10;&#10;Designer Edition Bitter Woods is the premier edition of this highly acclaimed regimental level Battle of the Bulge game and includes all aspects of the original game plus the expansion edition. The potential for mechanized exploitation movement and an appropriate Allied counterattack capability ensure an exciting challenge for both sides.

The queen bee and three workers move only one space to an adjacent hex space; the six drones move &quot;diagonally&quot; along a line leading away from the hex to the next hex. If you move  a token onto an enemy piece in the hive, you eliminate that piece from the game.&#10;&#10;If you move a token onto a piece already in the trench, you pin that piece; if you move a token onto an enemy that's pinning another piece, you eliminate that enemy token.

For, if he's noticed, the (also randomly selected) detective may have enough clues to lead to a proper accusation.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY:&#10;First, establish the play area. Usually this is played in a house, but it can be played anywhere that is dark enough.  You will want to establish areas that are off limits if any.&#10;&#10;Prepare a deck of cards, one per player.  The player who secretly, and randomly, selects the ace of spades is the murderer.  The one that selects the King is the detective. All others are civilians.&#10;&#10;Once these cards are secretly looked at, and replaced, a countdown is done, and the lights are turned out.&#10;&#10;At this point all players may wonder about freely. Some may hide, some may go out looking for evidence.  As the murderer, you may walk up to someone and say &quot;You're dead&quot;.  Once they've heard this they're dead, but they may also scream before they've been killed.  A &quot;dead body&quot; can be lead wherever the murderer would like to place them, and they must stay there until the end of this phase.&#10;&#10;One may also, regardless of the role, touch someone and ask &quot;are you dead?&quot;.  This is the only time a dead person may speak, &quot;yes&quot; they would say.  At this point &quot;body body body!&quot; is yelled.  Someone turns on the lights, and now we try to discover who the murderer was.&#10;&#10;All gather in a common area. Those who are dead indicate as such, and where they were found is established.  It is best for the dead to sit away from the main area.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that the dead not speak at all, or give any indication who killed them.&#10;&#10;If the detective has been killed, then the murderer has won.  Otherwise, the detective will start asking questions of the living.  Some play that the detective may only ask &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions.  The murderer may lie about anything, and also make false accusations.  Once the detective has an idea who the murderer is, they formally accuse them, the murderer may not lie at this point.&#10;&#10;If they're wrong, the lights go back out, and play continues.  The dead are still dead. But, of course, now the murderer knows the detective's identity.&#10;&#10;If they're right, the murderer has lost.&#10;&#10;ALTERNATE PLAY: Some play with more than one detective, which is a good idea if the group gets above 8.&#10;&#10;"

Part cards have a maintenance gauge, defense, melee and range attacks, and a special ability. Players will use these parts to attack their opponent's robo. In addition, players will be able to use action cards to modify attacks and defend against oncoming bombardment. A dice roll plus your modifiers from the robo part you use to attack and action card will have to beat your opponent's armor for the robo part you attack. A successful hit lowers the opponents maintenance gauge, usually by one level.&#10;Parts will take damage when hit. If a part takes too much damage, they can become inoperable and are at risk of blowing up, leaving you more vulnerable. If a player disables too many parts or destroys the chest part of a robo, then that robo is destroyed. Some may be fortunate enough to collect the necessary cards to perform an ultimate attack that will turn their opponents&rsquo; robo parts into scrap metal.
