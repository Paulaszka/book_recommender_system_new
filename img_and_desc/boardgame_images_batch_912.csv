The title is derived from two kanji words: &#232;&#171;&#150;&#231;&#144;&#134; (logic) which means in this game you can win by precise deduction, and &#229;&#191;&#131;&#231;&#144;&#134; (psychology) which means in this game you can win by bluffing as well. So the title implies this is a game of deduction vs. bluffing.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two phases: mustering phase and battle phase.&#10;&#10;During the mustering phase, players draft revealed soldier cards to form their hand of five cards each.&#10;&#10;A battle phase consists of five battles. During a battle, the attacker places a card face-down from their hand. The backside of the placed card has partial information about the soldier's identity. The defender looks at it, and places a card from their hand. Then they reveal both cards.&#10;&#10;A soldier card has its soldier type and power value printed on it. If both players have played a soldier of the same type, the soldier with the lower value wins the battle. Otherwise one with the higher value wins the battle, but some types get a bonus power against a certain type.&#10;&#10;A new round begins after the fifth battle. When a plyer has won total of six battles, that player immediately wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players know the identity of some cards their opponent has drafted, and the partial information is printed on backside of each card, which means defender can predict which card attacker has played. But there's some chance of attacker's bluff if carefully drafted. You should consider your opponent's intention to win the game.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#172;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#167;&#139;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#229;&#141;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#191;&#174;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#232;&#161;&#157;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#233;&#128;&#134;&#232;&#187;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#136;&#164;&#230;&#150;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#230;&#131;&#133;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#129;&#169;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;"

To do this, they need to pay careful attention to the Emperor's preferences, while trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.&#10;&#10;A turn in Zen Garden is simple: The first player selects one tile from the selection board, pays its cost, then adds it to their garden adjacent to a previously placed tile. Each player does this, then the board is refilled and a new starting player begins the next turn.&#10;&#10;Zen Garden comes with five preference boards that determine which features of the garden score in that game.

The player commands the Japanese forces, with the Allies are controlled by the game system. The player's objective is to accomplish campaign objectives ahead of the original schedule, thereby forestalling the inevitable US-led Allied offensive. A critical factor in the game is victory fever. The more the Japanese are winning, the greater the chance they will have to attain additional objectives to win the game. Another factor is the game ends before the Allied counteroffensive in the Solomons, so there are no Allied amphibious operations. Most ground units in the game represent divisions, brigades and regiments. Aircraft units represent one to three air groups or regiments (three to nine squadrons). Distances between each space on the map vary depending on location and strategic importance, with the distance varying from 1,000 to a few hundred kilometers. Each turn represents one month of operations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Published in &quot;World At War&quot; magazine, issue #75&#10;&#10;"

It covers the Soviet invasion of Finland over the Winter of 1939-40. The Soviets initially expected a quick victory. However, the Finns, under the leadership of Carl Gustav Mannerheim, resisted and outmaneuvered the more ponderous Red Army forces. It was not until Marshal Timoshenko was appointed to lead the campaign, that the Soviets gained the initiative. They captured sufficient territory to bring the war to a negotiated end. The Soviet historical objectives were to seize key geographical areas and inflict sufficient Finnish casualties to force the Finns to negotiate a pro-Soviet Union peace treaty. The Finns were attempting to prevent this or prolong the war to where outside intervention would come to their aid. Each hex on the map represents circa 21 miles. Each turn of play represents ten days. Ground units represent detachments, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions and corps. Aircraft units represent a number of sorties to accomplish a mission.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players will compete to be the most renowned captain to ever sail the Kanvus Sea. In doing so, players will plunder islands for valuable loot, pillage loot from other captains using a unique sea battle mechanic, and complete objectives to write shanties that will become their legacy once Davy Jones takes his toll.&#10;&#10;Sea Shanties' environmentally friendly design utilizes dynamic board tiles printed on canvas. There are over a duodecillion different configurations of the board, meaning you will never play on the same board twice!&#10;&#10;Players start with 15 crew and a ship token on a starting island, selected by a draft. Players have 5 additional crew tokens in Hunter's Tavern.&#10;&#10;Every captain's turn has three phases - Actions, then Bury, then Collect (ABC). During the action phase, captains may take up to 5 actions. The five available actions are Sail (Move their ship token to an adjacent square on the board, utilizing wind arrows), Plunder (place crew tokens from your player board onto an island that your ship token occupies), Abandon (remove all of your tokens from an island that your ship token does not occupy and place them in Hunter's Tavern), Recruit (place one crew token from Hunters Tavern onto your player board), and Sea Battle (initiate a battle with another captain's if their ship is in an adjacent square).&#10;&#10;After the action phase, captains may Bury their loot that they had on their ship. Buried loot cannot be pillaged in sea battles. Once that phase is done, players may then Collect 1 loot per loot-producing island they control, collect any Ballads if they have buried the most of a particular type of loot, and collect one verse if they completed the specified objective on it.&#10;&#10;Sea Battles are an augmented Prisoner's Dilemmah. Captains will secretly select a number on the battle dial between 0 and the number of crew tokens they have on their captain's placards (not on in the tavern or on islands). They will simultaneously reveal their selected numbers. The highest number wins and may pillage loot tokens from the loser equal to the difference of the two selected numbers. The winner will also have to surrender crew to the tavern equal to the difference. Lastly, the winner gets a Fear loot chit. Do you send all of your crew to battle, knowing that the opposer might select a low number and you lose most of your crew?&#10;&#10;Once all of the shanties have been sung, the player with the most Renown Points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
