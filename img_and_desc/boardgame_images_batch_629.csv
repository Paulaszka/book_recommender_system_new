The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it. You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you've collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Super Motherload features game boards that are added and removed during play to create videogame-like scrolling action, and it challenges spatial relation skills for 2-4 players who love video games, Eurostyle board games, or deck-building card games.&#10;&#10;"

Using resource gathering, building construction, exploration and movement mechanisms for the Wilderness Phase, supported by an additive Worker Placement mechanism during the Village Phase, each player will design their own city; each building adding to options in game play.&#10;&#10;Each player will start out in the Wilderness phase each round. Actions will consist of using workers tokens on the island tiles, some actions requiring 1 or more workers to be used to perform that action. Players will continue in the Wilderness phase until they run out workers to perform said actions. But if a player finishes their wilderness actions before others, they don't just sit around; they head into the Village phase and may get better placements for their workers on the Village board.&#10;&#10;In the Village phase the players will use the same workers that worked for them in the Wilderness phase in this phase as well, but will instead perform money-making, shipbuilding, hiring horses, taxing, and farming actions. Each space in the village requires 1 more worker for each additional use, no matter the player. After the workers are again spent, they go into the rest box to wait to be paid to work again in the following round, in cash or food.&#10;&#10;Each building that is constructed will require permanent residence i.e. worker tokens will be used as the building itself. Using worker tokens as buildings will cut down on a player's supply of workers available in following rounds, so knowing when to construct buildings is an important timing constraint.&#10;&#10;There is a race to the end game, but getting there will support many strategies. The first player to build a complete working city (all but 1-3 worker tokens used in buildings), wins.&#10;&#10;It was heavily inspired by the Splotter games: Roads &amp; Boats and Antiquity.

We lose, and humanity's freedom is gone. Of course, we do this, we'll be heroes. I figure we've got zero chance anyways, so let's call this Zero Day.&#10;&#10;In Zero Day, you are a hacker in a civilization built on technology. Your commensurately useful skill set will allow you to write code or reverse engineer it from ...other sources... and piece it together to find exploits that can be used against the oppressive Mainframe. The first player to inject enough exploits into the Mainframe to bring it under their own control wins &mdash; but be warned as the Mainframe will not sit idle when it detects intrusions!&#10;&#10;Every round you get three hacker action markers that can be used for one of three things:&#10;&#10;     Building up programs by &quot;writing&quot; them using appropriate sets of code cubes.&#10;     Running your programs to acquire exploit discs.&#10;     Reverse engineering other programs by swapping your resources for what's already there (which is also how you inject exploits into the Mainframe).&#10;&#10;&#10;You may retain action markers from round to round, but they (as well as your unused code and other discs) count against your limited total resource capacity. As a result, you must manage your actions and available space, and balance it with the risk that comes with having programs available to others.&#10;&#10;"
