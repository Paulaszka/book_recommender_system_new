It is designed to meet Washington's K-12 educational standards for teaching about native history, economics, culture, and government. The game was developed as a community effort with local elders and language experts. The game is written in both English and Lushootseed, the indigenous language of the Salish Pacific Northwest. Game mechanics are based on sharing resources to meet other players&rsquo; needs for food, materials, technology, and knowledge.&#10;&#10;This is a collaborative game where there is not one winner. Success is determined by whether or not all houses have their resource needs met by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is named for the Potlatch, which is a ceremonial distribution and re-distribution of resources, property, food, knowledge, and wealth with the purpose of affirming social status via the historic economic systems of subsistence, prestige, and sharing. Potlatching is practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific NW coast of the U.S. and Canada. Historically it supported a large socio-economic system to maintain a high level of food production and to equalize food accessibility. Individuals, families, or communities host potlatches and planning takes a year or more. Skagit elder and historian, Vi Hilbert, wrote &ldquo;Public acts of distributing valuables to guests were the ultimate confirmation of a host&rsquo;s achievements and personal high-status in their family and community.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;"

You play as ghosts possessing a group of kids in a cabin in the woods, trying to figure out how you died by piecing together your fragmented memories.&#10;&#10;Play is started by shuffling the 26 double-sided word fragment cards (Fewer cards can be used for a faster game). Each player is dealt one card (they can flip the card to the other side at any time). One card is placed in the middle of the table. Any player may start play. The first player places the card from their hand onto the tableau so that it forms a word using one or more letters from the card already in the tableau. The player may put the card on top of the card already on the table, or slide the card underneath, as long as the card on the table is not shuffled around. When the first player has formed a word, they draw a word fragment card from the pile and point to another player. The player pointed to must start to tell the story of the death of the ghosts from the ghosts&rsquo; point of view, incorporating the word that was just made. For example, if the first player formed the word &ldquo;angst,&rdquo; the player they pointed to could say: &ldquo;The last thing I remember is a feeling of angst as I slumped through the halls.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Any player may go next by adding their card to the growing tableau to make a new word and pointing to a player to continue the story (as long as a player does not make a word twice in a row). Play continues until all the cards in the deck and players' hands are gone.

238955,,"&quot;Voter Beware&quot; (Subrog&#196;&#129;tor Cave, in Latin) is a political dice  rolling game about Food Truck politics. Bernie Salad, Hilaire, Gervais Juanson, and  Donny Sausage all wish to become President of the Food Truck Association, the political position which controls all of the menus on local food trucks. In this game, one to four players will take turns rolling four dice and assigning them to each candidate, who in turn will utilize the die assigned them based on its value.&#10;&#10;Possible actions include buying influence, buying votes, enhancing your influence with a funding PAC, or delivering a nasty Dirty Trick to an opponent's campaign, lowering their stature with PACs and potentially hurting their ability to compete. At the end of each turn, a Scandal may erupt which damages a candidate's reputation with the voting blocs that they buy votes from.&#10;&#10;This is a unique, one to four-player political game that takes between 20-40 minutes  to play, and with simple-to-understand rules but truly difficult decisions each turn, it's perfect for a coffee shop or lunch hour either by yourself or with friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

You can put a vehicle after a vehicle of the same color or the same shape.  As you lay out your pieces you create a big traffic jam across the board.  Some cars have no special function others make the next player to skip a turn, give the player an extra turn or makes the next player take more tokens.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to get rid of all your tokens, when you have one token left, you need to shout something or you need to take a new token from the reserve.&#10;&#10;The game is played totally on magnetic surfaces which is nice.  The players get their magnetic tokens on parking lot cards in their hands to keep them secret.  The board is laid out in the tin lid thus making it magnetic itself.  This makes it perfect to play everywhere.&#10;&#10;There are 32 car tokens, 3 parking lots and one main board in the box.&#10;&#10;"
