To do so they take turns rolling a six sided die and simply move that number of spaces on the gameboard.&#10;&#10;There are three types of spaces you may land on. Drink spaces require pulling a drink card from a pile in the center of the gameboard and simply taking that number of drinks before throwing the card in a discard pile to be shuffled and placed back in the center when there are no more drink cards to draw.&#10;&#10;Fight spaces require the player to draw a fight card from the pile in the center of the board. These unique characters all have a power rating from 1 to 6. The player then has to roll a six sided die against the power of the fight card. If they win they keep the card and can use it once against their opponents to knock them back on the gameboard a number of spaces equal to the power of the card. If they lose they drink the difference of their roll and the power of the fight card as well as move back that many spaces on the gameboard.&#10;&#10;The third type of spaces are home and the bar themselves. These are safe spaces where no fighting can occur. Otherwise no two players can occupy the same space on the board and will have to fight each other (by each rolling dice) to see who stays on the space and who gets bumped back the difference of the two rolls on the gameboard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;

Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their &quot;river&quot; and &quot;cup&quot;. At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.&#10;&#10;The linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one &quot;field&quot; for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the &quot;Rule of Color&quot;: Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.&#10;&#10;A mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players &quot;destroy&quot; the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river. Both players then tally the value of all the cards in their cup, based on the position of the colors in their river, and whoever has the higher score wins!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     1 linen playmat&#10;     108 mandala cards (18 in each of 6 colours)&#10;     2 reference cards&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The goal of each trick is to be the last player still &ldquo;in,&rdquo; and this earns you one point for every card in the trick.&#10;&#10;To start the round, shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards you deal out varies with the number of players, as follows:&#10;&#10;Players: 2 3 4 5 6&#10;Cards: 8 7 6 5 4&#10;&#10;The dealer plays the top card of the deck to start the first trick.

On each turn, you may do one of three things: build, test, or withdraw&#10;&#10;Build: Play a card from your hand into the countdown. This card can&rsquo;t match any of the cards that are already there. If you complete a perfect countdown (all ten cards), then you win this trick immediately. Otherwise, play continues, and you are still in.&#10;&#10;Test: Play the top card of the deck. If it is a legal play, then your test is a success, and you are still in the trick. If it matches another card, then you are knocked out of the trick, and take that card into your hand.&#10;&#10;Withdraw: Play no cards, and take yourself out of the trick. You also take one card from the table into your hand, unless this would leave no cards on the table.&#10;&#10;Note: When out of the trick, lay your hand face down on the table, with the card that you just took face up on top. This makes it easier for everyone to see who is in and out.&#10;&#10;Taking the Trick: When only one player remains in the trick, that player wins the trick and scores those cards. All players come back in, and the winner leads the next trick by playing the top card of the deck. If the deck is empty at this step, the round is over.&#10;&#10;Scoring: Each card captured in a trick is worth one point. Play six rounds, and then the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;"

In each round, players take turns playing cards into the center and trying to complete &ldquo;sandwiches.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;A sandwich is a sequence of cards in which one or more smaller cards lie between two matching larger cards. For example, 9-8-3-9 is a &ldquo;nine sandwich,&rdquo; made from two 9&rsquo;s surrounding an 8 and 3. However, 9-8-10-9 is not a nine sandwich, because the 10 is larger than the 9&rsquo;s. Playing a 10 into the second sequence would create a ten sandwich: 9-8-10-9-10.&#10;&#10;Note: Two matching cards in a row does not make a sandwich, because there must be at least one smaller card between them.&#10;&#10;To Begin the Round: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player.

If you complete a sandwich, you pick up those cards and score them.&#10;&#10;Scoring: For the &ldquo;bread,&rdquo; the large cards that bracket the sandwich, you score one point per card. For the &ldquo;meat,&rdquo; the smaller cards inside the bread, you score face value. For example, a sandwich of 7-4-7 would be&#10;worth a total of 6 points: 4 for the meat, and 1+1 for the bread. Keep these cards aside, with the bread face down and the meat face up.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all players&rsquo; hands are empty. Record your scores for the round and pass the deal to the left.&#10;The total number of rounds in the game is given above.&#10;&#10;Team Play with Odd Numbers?&#10;&#10;With five or seven players, you can use a format of rotating teams. The dealer plays alone, and the other players divide into two teams. With five players, the teams are A-B-A-B-D, where D is the dealer. With seven, they are A-B-A-B-A-B-D. In a full game, each player deals once.&#10;&#10;Because these teams are temporary, each player keeps a separate score. Both of the players on a team score all of that team&rsquo;s points.&#10;&#10;"

Dice show various positions and each player has to respect them when it is their turn to play.&quot;&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is connecting opposing sides of a curved hexagon (3 sides in 2 players, 2 sides in 3 players). At each turn two dice are rolled that indicate the possible pieces to play stating from pieces already on the board. Special configuration of pieces lead to the elimination of opponents pieces from the board.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;"

Each slice has a number from 1 to 4 on one side and an ingredient with the respective quantity on the other. For example, on one side there is the number 3 and on the other there are 3 mushrooms. Some slices are rotten.&#10;The current player rolls the 2 dice (which show an ingredient and a number) and takes the corresponding segment.&#10;The game includes 3 modes:&#10;- Basic mode (for 2 players aged 4+): whoever completes a pizza first earns a hat. To complete a pizza you have to take exactly 10 ingredients. The winner is the first player with 3 hats.&#10;- Complete mode (for 2 players aged 5+): compared to the previous mode, the slices should be placed face down on the side with the number. As a result, children should remember the ingredients below and avoid rotten pizza slices.&#10;- Cooperative mode (for 1 or more players aged 5+): the children collaborate and try to complete a pizza before that rotten pizza is formed.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

It is possible to play in competitive or cooperative mode.&#10;&#10;In the competitive version each player takes turns in the role of host and secretly assigns the identities to 5 unknown people, choosing among the 8 available. The other players bet on the identity of the current unknown, also using the available clues.&#10;Who guesses gains the value of the unknown, but if everyone has made a mistake, the host loses the value of the unknown. The host, therefore, must be careful to choose an identity that is neither too easy, otherwise all others earn money, not too difficult, not to lose them himself.&#10;After having unveiled the identities of the 5 unknowns, the proof of the mysterious relative takes place: the host draws another unknown and chooses which of the 5 initial unknowns is his relative, also assigning clues to the degree of kinship and the 2 unknowns to be excluded. Who misses the mysterious relative loses 50.000 &euro;: also in this case the host must be careful because if nobody guesses, he will lose 50.000 &euro;. After everyone has played the role of the host, whoever has the most money is the winner.&#10;&#10;In the cooperative version all the players collaborate to earn as much as possible. Contrary to the previous mode, the host must try to help the players as much as possible.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

To travel, you must play a number of cards equal to the number of small circles present along the link. Based on the played cards, the player will advance his disk on the timeline path. It takes less time to play cards with the same number or the same color. On each destination there is a food that is taken by the first player to reach it, so the players must also be quick in anticipating the opponents' moves. When a player reaches a goal destination, he has the right to take one extra food and, if he correctly answers a question, he earns a bonus card that he can play in subsequent rounds.&#10;&#10;When a player has visited all his destinations, the game ends: the players receive bonuses and malus in terms of time based on the reached destinations and the taken foods. Foods have different values depending on the type: rice will give a fixed time saving, the sandwich in a growing way, the fruit based on who has more, while the fish will give a penalty to those who have less.&#10;The player who has spent less time wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"
