Each round, two players (one from each team) race each other, trying to deliver an egg to their team's nest.&#10;&#10;To set up the round, each player receives a seagull on a stick, which he has to hold by the stick during the race. The seagulls have a backpack, in which a flat paper egg is placed. Now, a spinner is spun, determining the special conditions for this round: it may be a straightforward race, or there may be special conditions, such as the players being required to run backwards or to spin twice before delivering the egg.&#10;&#10;If a player drops his egg, he is out of the race for that round. If both players succesfully deliver their eggs, the fastest player's team receives an additional egg.&#10;&#10;The game continues until fewer than three undelivered eggs remain at the beginning of a round. Now, players inspect their eggs by flipping them over to see which ones &quot;hatch&quot;. (Those that hatch have a chick painted on the back.) The team with the most chicks wins.&#10;&#10;"

This little abstract ends as soon as one player gets any one piece to the single goal space at the opposite end of the board. To do so, one has to get past the opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;Each player has two types of pieces which mostly move similarly. One can jump one's own pieces or jump to capture an opponent's. Multiple jumps in any direction are allowed. So, sudden reversals and leaps to victory are not uncommon. Since only one piece in the goal is needed to win, this game can be unforgiving. Still it's quick and many games can be played in one sitting.&#10;&#10;Cam, released by Parker Brothers in 1949, is a down-sized version of Camelot.&#10;&#10;Cam is different than Camelot in the following ways:&#10;&#10;    The Cam board has 67 squares.  The Camelot board has 160 squares.&#10;    Each side in Cam has two Knights and five Men.  Each side in Camelot has four Knights and ten Men.  &#10;    The object of Cam is to get one piece into the opponent's Castle.  The object of Camelot is to get two pieces into the opponent's Castle.  &#10;    Victory in Cam also occurs if one side, even with only one remaining piece, captures all of the opposing pieces.  In Camelot, if the side capturing all of the opposing pieces has only one remaining piece, the game is a draw.  Victory in Camelot by capture of all of the opposing pieces occurs only if the victorious side has two or more remaining pieces.    &#10;    Stalemate in Cam is impossible.  Stalemate in Camelot is possible, and is a victory for the stalemating side if it has two or more pieces.  &#10;    In Cam, if both sides have only one remaining piece, the game continues until one piece captures the other, or one piece enters the opposing Castle.  In Camelot, if both sides have only one remaining piece, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Chivalry&#10;    Camelot&#10;&#10;&#10;"

117874,,"Grand Cam is a four-player analog of the game Cam. This is a partnership pure abstract game. Partners sit next to each other. To win, one player has to move a piece into the goal opposite his pieces' starting position or all the losing partnership's pieces must be captured.&#10;&#10;This has the marked differences in play between Camelot and Cam combined with two pairs of immediate opponents whose pieces generally move in directions orthogonal to each other.&#10;&#10;The design of the Grand Cam piece setup and the design and construction of the first Grand Cam game board in 2005 owe themselves to WCF member Paul Bramwell Smith, who is deservedly acknowledged as the game's inventor.&#10;&#10;Grand Cam is different than Grand Camelot in the following ways:&#10;&#10;1. The Grand Cam board has 93 squares.  The Grand Camelot board has 180 squares.&#10;&#10;2. Each side in Grand Cam has two Knights and five Men.  Each side in Grand Camelot has four Knights and eight Men.&#10;&#10;"
