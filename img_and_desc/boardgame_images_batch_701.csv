The game lasts 6-8 hands depending on the number of players, and in each round each player draws a number of dice from the bag equal to the current hand, e.g., five dice for the fifth hand, then places them behind their screen, keeping these dice a secret from all. After getting their dice, each player simultaneously bids the number of tricks they think they'll claim during the round by putting out fingers on their hand. Record these bids on the scoresheet.&#10;&#10;The first player in a hand chooses a die from behind their screen, then rolls it in public. If they roll a number die, each other player must roll a number die of this color, if possible; otherwise they roll a die of their choice. Alternatively, a player can always roll a minotaur, griffin, or mermaid die. After each player has rolled, see who has the highest die and claims this trick. A rolled flag is a 0 and cannot win the trick. The minotaur beats the griffin, which beats the mermaid, which beats the minotaur &mdash; and all of these special characters beat numbers. If no one rolls a special character, the highest number rolled wins the trick, with a tie being broken in favor of whoever rolled later. The player who wins the trick collects the dice in front of their screen, then chooses a die from their collection to start the next trick.&#10;&#10;After all the tricks have been claimed, players score points. If you made your bid exactly, score 20 points per trick bid; if you missed your bid, lose 10 points for each trick your bid was off, whether higher or lower. If you bid zero tricks and make it, score 10 points for each trick in the hand; if you miss a 0 bid, lose 10 points for each trick in the hand regardless of how many tricks you made. If you made your bid and captured a minotaur with a mermaid without also capturing a flag, score 50 bonus points; similarly, if you capture a griffin with a minotaur without capturing a flag, score 30 bonus points.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the highest total score after the last hand is complete wins.&#10;&#10;"

Whatever you do in Vampire Queen, though, be sure to rid yourself of an intrusive vampire hunter because no one wants to get stuck with that!&#10;&#10;The deck consists of cards numbered 1-13, four vampire queens that have variable value, and two vampire hunters. Players start with a hand of 9-13 cards depending on the player count, and the start player for a round plays from their hand either a single card, multiple cards of the same value, or a vampire hunter. Vampire queens on their own (or in a pair, triplet, or quartet) are valued at 14, but they can be played with other cards and adopt the value of those cards. For a single card or a set of cards (e.g., three 6s), each other player in turn can either pass or play the same number of cards but of a higher value (e.g., three 9s). Whoever plays the highest card(s) wins the round and leads off the next round.&#10;&#10;If the round's start player leads a vampire hunter, it counts as value 0 and each other player must play exactly one (non-vampire hunter) card of whatever value they want. Whoever plays the highest card takes all played cards into their hand, then leads off the next round, but they cannot lead with the same vampire hunter they just won.&#10;&#10;When one or more players have emptied their hand at the end of a round, the round ends. Players then score points for all cards still in hand, with number cards being worth their face value, queens being 14, and vampire hunter cards being 15 or 20, as indicated. Players with vampire hunters in hand keep them, then shuffle all cards and deal new hands to all players, with the player who holds the 20 starting.

The game starts so that everyone has one on the board, then a special die is rolled. If you get 1, 2 or 3 you put your other pawn on the board - now you are on the move. But beware, as your moves always affect your next move as well. The basic idea is that you always move by putting the pawn that is behind in the exact opposite spot (called &quot;A&quot;-spot) in front of the other pawn. You do however roll the die on each turn and that tells you how many grid points you can deviate from the &quot;A&quot; spot (from 0-3). Deviating sideways represents steering while deviating the two pawns closer or further apart represents deceleration and acceleration. Thus, the two pawns form a vector which represents the car's speed and it goes without saying that if you approach a tight curve with a too long vector (=too high speed) you won't be able to make it within the possible die results, but will crash out of the track. Crashing will cause you to pass a number of turns equal to your speed, which is doubled if the crash happened in a particularly difficult spot, as marked on the board. Rolling a &quot;NO&quot; will force you to pass the turn while rolling a &quot;FREE&quot; gives you an extra turn. Rolling 0 means that the car simply keeps it speed and direction for that turn (with possibly disastrous results if it happens many times in a row).&#10;&#10;Hitting a green spot on the track causes you to pick a Turbo card (good) while hitting one of the more plentiful yellow spots means a Danger card (bad, surprisingly). Hitting one of the red spots gives you a free move, which is somewhat limited by the blue lines that divide the track into shorter &quot;race areas&quot;.&#10;&#10;After a pre-agreed number of laps, the winner is the player who first manages to cross the finish line AND bring their car to a controlled full stop.&#10;&#10;The game promises to give &quot;a surprisingly realistic feel of racing&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game comes with the basic track of Monza. Additional tracks have been published for Hockenheim, Las Vegas and Monaco (1983).&#10;&#10;"
