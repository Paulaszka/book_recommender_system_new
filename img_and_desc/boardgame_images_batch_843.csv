The game is played over three days, where players choose which locations to play their set of songs. It takes time to play a song, so players decide on their next turn whether they're going to use all of their energy at the location or to only use some of it to save the rest for later songs. If a player matches the mood of the people with the song that they're playing, they can get bonus tips!&#10;&#10;Escalating Rounds: The game starts with three locations players can play at, but by the final round, there's five locations so players have to choose where to play wisely!&#10;Engaging Gameplay: Players determine how much energy to allocate to each location after seeing how other players play, so players pay attention to what happens between their turns.&#10;Thematic Actions: Songs require differing amounts of energy from musicians and players are rewarded greatly for playing the songs that the crowd wants to hear.&#10;&#10;Decide whether you want to try to get a few tips from the crowd at every location or if you really want to win over a particular crowd in this musical game of area control!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player controls a &quot;mummy&quot; token that moves about the board, square-by-square, as desired.  The gridded board is laid out roughly to approximate a humanoid form.  Players start in the &quot;head&quot; grid and then move to specific squares in each &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;foot&quot; to collect canopic jars containing organs.  All four embalmed organs (stomach, intestines, liver, and lungs) are required for the mummy to reach the afterlife.  The first player to recover all four of the needed organs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each grid square has a random chance (25%) of containing a beast; this is determined when the first character moves into the square.  Beasts, if encountered, must be defeated to proceed.  Individual mummies can take damage and be destroyed (the player loses and drops out of the game).&#10;&#10;The primary innovation of the game involves player movement.  Players must move in a &quot;conga line&quot; pattern, following exactly in the leader's footsteps, but one to three squares behind (depending on how many players there are).  The line leader makes all decisions and performs all combat.  If desired, the line leader can yield their position (when low on health, for example) and move to the back of the line.  Alternately, each player can cast three &quot;compel&quot; spells during the game.  Each &quot;compel&quot; spell forces the leader to move to the back of the line.&#10;&#10;The basic strategy is to remain at the back of the line (in safety) through the first three organ collections then to move (and remain) in the lead position for the final organ collection (thus, winning).&#10;&#10;The game supports single-player play, though this becomes simply an exercise of trying to move and survive to the end, rather than managing the &quot;conga line&quot; strategy.&#10;&#10;The game is provided as a four-page, print-and-play PDF document containing the rules and the game board.  It was distributed for free from various online sites.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Units are either various types of humans or animals.  Each unit typically has some specific single quality (e.g., a Spearman has a very high morale level, etc.).  The game is limited to two opposing forces; players alternate taking turns.  Checks in the game (morale, hit, etc.) are made using one or two ten-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Units represent single combatants.  Morale checks are made for each unit under several circumstances; failed checks lead first to degraded morale, then to rout.  Movement is given in inches, and units may walk, run, or charge.  Rout (flee) movement is given in random inches.  During a turn, missile fire precedes m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and effects take place immediately (this gives considerable advantage to the player that moves first in the game).  Units sustaining damage can be killed or captured.&#10;&#10;The game does not use scale and any &quot;small&quot; figures (generally, miniatures or tokens) may be used.&#10;&#10;A player loses when all of their units are killed, captured, or routed.  Alternately, the players can agree upon victory conditions prior to the game (typically capturing specific units or routing a certain number of units to represent area control).&#10;&#10;The game was provided as a downloadable PDF document, and at one time also was hosted online in HTML format.&#10;&#10;&mdash;User Summary&#10;&#10;"

Each counter represents a single combatant.  Each combatant has unique skills derived from an available pool of combat &quot;styles&quot; that are reminiscent of pop-culture martial arts.  Combatants are further specialized by buying abilities using a points pool.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns.  Within a turn, movement and combat are rather free-form; attacks are resolved using two ten-sided dice, with modifiers, and results are applied immediately.  Players may set their own victory conditions, but the default condition is complete destruction of the opposing force.  The game is unusual in allowing much variety in the individual units, with significant player decisions made during unit construction (this also is a somewhat time-consuming pre-play process).&#10;&#10;The game is published as a print-and-play instruction manual.&#10;&#10;&mdash;User summary&#10;&#10;"

The last time was 1979 when the PRC invaded Vietnam in response to the latter's invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That war lasted about four weeks before China withdrew, having declared its mission accomplished. &#10; Now, the old foes are at it once again. Sparring over the resource rich areas of the South China Sea, both sides have been slowly edging toward the precipice of war. That day has now come.&#10;&#10;Next War: Vietnam is the fifth game in the Next War Series. This game returns the action to Asia and the powderkeg surrounding the South China Sea. This time the Chinese don't intend a limited, punitive expedition; they intend to squash the burgeoning threat from their southern border once and for all and prove, through force of arms, that the South China Sea is theirs. Building on the naval rules showcased Next War: Taiwan, players will have a chance to fight over the Spratly and Paracel Islands once again, as well as the mountainous jungle of North Vietnam. &#10; If the U.S. gets involved, it might finally land troops in Haiphong Harbor and march on Hanoi, albeit as a relief force and an ally to its former enemy. The question is what will the rest of the region do? Will they join a side or stay neutral?&#10; Next War: Vietnam will also allow players to play a combined game with Next War:Taiwan, and, with the rules in the latter game, adding on NextWar: Korea as well for what would amount to the Pacific Front of World War III. &#10; Ownership of any previous Next War Series will NOT be required to play Next War: Vietnam.&#10;&#10;Units: &#10; Next War: Vietnam primarily represents divisions and brigades of the armies of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency. The Vietnamese People's Self Defense Force is represented both by units and special rules. &#10; Air units represent the fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants. They are rated for All-Weather Capabilities, range, average pilot skill and training, and their capabilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions. &#10; Naval units represent an abstraction of groups of ships (task forces) and allow players to conduct amphibious invasions, naval combat, naval gunfire support, and more. &#10; Maps and Terrain &#10; The game&rsquo;s map represents the area in and around the northern border of Vietnam at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from just west of Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam to just east of Nanning, China and just north of the PRC-SRV border to a few miles south of Thanh Hoa, Vietnam. &#10; The Spratlys, Paracels, and other sea areas are represented by a Strategic Display incorporating Land Areas and At Sea Boxes similar to the one in Next War: Taiwan. &#10; Game System &#10; A game turn is composed of:&#10;&#10;Weather Determination wherein bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations. &#10;Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. &#10;Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes. &#10;One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns. &#10;Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements &#10;Victory Determination&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;&#10;There are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives, while at least one will be a campaign game encompassing the entire map. Similarly to previous games in the series, the Advanced Game scenarios will be divided into various starting points representing different levels of build-up before the game begins.&#10;&#10;Next War: Vietnam puts you in command of the potential conflict. Can you, as the Chinese player, enforce your will on Vietnam and achieve your goals in the South China Sea, shaping your position in world affairs? Or will you, as the Vietnamese player, once again successfully defend against your larger northern neighbor?&#10;&#10;"

In it, you and your fellow player are two friends having a conversation.&#10;&#10;The board represents your conversation space, and your pieces represent your ideas. The goal of the game is simple: connect 3 of your ideas in a row anywhere on the board. This is called a Conclusion.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll take turns placing your ideas onto the board, with the restriction that new tiles may only be placed in the center nine squares. Each tile has a space that it will target with a unique effect. If placed correctly, a player's tiles can push or pull the opposing player's tiles. Moved tiles may also push neighboring tiles or even enter into the target space of the current player's previously placed tiles, triggering chain reactions. Tiles that are eventually pushed off of the board are returned to the player that owns them. The game ends when a single player has reached a Conclusion: three of their tiles connected in a line, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.&#10;&#10;Philosophy often feels more like a puzzle than a competitive game, as the board state grows in complexity and changes between turns.

All the characters are from Japanese video games named &quot;The Idolmaster&quot; and &quot;The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player has six idol (pop singer) cards at the beginning of the game. Players take turns playing an idol card and rolling a number of dice printed on the card, determining her power. Then she activates her ability written on the card. Dice results are changed frequently by their abilities.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players have played five cards. They total the power of all their idols, and the player with the greatest power wins the game.&#10;&#10;Depending on game mode, initial cards are determined by simple deal or rochester draft. Additionally, a three-game match can be played if each player has a copy of this game. Players make three groups of six idols and play three games. The player with highest total score of three games wins the match.&#10;&#10;The game has been published since 2012, and new stand-alone expansions have been added, from Track 2 through to Track 5. You can mix these sets as you like, or play them separately. The rules remain the same, the card sets vary. The decks are for two players, but more can play when combining decks.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#229;&#137;&#181;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#189;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#229;&#165;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#162;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#229;&#191;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#228;&#186;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;5&#228;&#186;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"
