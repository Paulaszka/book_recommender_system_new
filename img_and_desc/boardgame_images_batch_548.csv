Then the player to the left has their choice of lane and so on until all players have had a lane allocated.&#10;&#10;The player who goes first spins the Spinner and whoever has a racing car on the same lane as the colour indicated by the dial moves the number of spaces shown in that segment. The leader can then change lanes to whatever colour they think will come up next. After the leader has chosen a lane the next player in position order can do likewise (it is permissible to have two or more racing cars in the same lane).&#10;&#10;The game progresses with each player following the direction of course until the leader crosses the finish line either by a 'flying finish' (crossing the line on any number) or finishes on exactly the right number as decided before the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;1x Board&#10;1x Spinner with rules&#10;4x Racing cars (one each of red, blue, green and yellow)&#10;&#10;"

Fearless adventurers from throughout the kingdom gather forces under their banners, while prominent lords fortify their castles to withstand a siege. The whole world has turned upside down in the fever of war: dwarves have been seen defending the elves&rsquo; woodland strongholds against legions of the undead, great dragons have razed ancient obelisks to the ground, while heroes have used both brute force and cunning to capture enemy castles. The King can barely keep up with awarding commanders their well-earned titles for valor and heroism on the field of battle, and there&rsquo;s not a single distinguished title that hasn&rsquo;t already changed hands at least a dozen times. After all, it&rsquo;s not the strength of your castle or the size of your army that counts &mdash; only the favor of the supreme ruler will decide who ultimately merits receiving the King&rsquo;s Bounty.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Based on the bestselling video game of the same name, King&rsquo;s Bounty is a board game that&rsquo;s played with cards. The players take control of one of five races &mdash; elves, dwarves, orcs, humans or the undead &mdash; and use their armies to capture castles and obelisks, earning victory points in the process.

It pits two to six players against each other in one simple challenge - to make the most money on the stock market so as to out-bid each other for luxury items. However the stock market is volatile and unpredictable. Take-over bids, profit warnings, insider trading and much more, all contribute to make TradeOff an exciting and strategic roller-coaster ride from beginning to end.&#10;&#10;HOW IT WORKS: The mat acts as the stock market and consists of four stocks. During the course of the game each stock's value independently rises and falls as dictated by the cards that players collect. Players can predict these rises and falls by studying their own cards and watching how their opponents are investing.&#10;&#10;Making an investment is easy. Players select a stock they think will rise in value and simply place a number of their chips on the mat next to the stock's share price marker. Profit and losses are easily calculated by either using the numbers printed on the mat or by using the free app available on our website. But it's not only the cards that determine how the stock's values will change. When players invest in, or sell an investment, the stock's value rises or falls accordingly. This gives players the chance to be nasty to each other by reducing the value of their opponents investments!&#10;&#10;Throughout the course of the game auctions are held for luxury items. During these auctions players must out-bid each other to secure the purchase of the item. The first player to obtain the requisite number of luxury items wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously drop a predetermined number of tiles onto the board, then quickly flip them all ivory side up.

If the last player is taking too long to call a word, any of his opponents can &quot;hurry&quot; him by starting the timer; if he doesn't call out a word in 15 seconds, he busts, scoring nothing.&#10;&#10;Once every player has called a word for the round, they score points in the order they called out the words, so the first player who called scores first, the second player second, etc. The first time a tile is used &ndash; that is, while its ivory side is face-up &ndash; the tile is worth 10 points. Once it's been scored, flip (or &quot;KerFlip&quot;) it to its orange side, reducing its value to 5 points for all other players who used it in the same round. Some tiles, identified by a small number in the bottom right corner, are &quot;premium tiles&quot; that award players cards with bonus point values.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, return any unused (ivory) tiles to the draw pouch and sweep all used (orange) tiles into the collection chutes in the game box.

This system uses a card driven AI, so when you are playing solo, you still feel that you are playing against another person. Of coarse the artificial intelligence is not as smart as a human brain, so the AI is given some special advantages to make it a worthy opponent. The four player variant is simply a 2 on 2 battle, that feels almost the same as a 2 player game, but you are partnered up with a teammate, with whom you can trade cards and devise strategies.&#10;&#10;Further, Scared to Death can be played using only the cards, or with an add-on betting system that uses tokens, money, or even Halloween candy!

The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.&#10;&#10;Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operations, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.&#10;&#10;The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is a historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).&#10;&#10;The game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.&#10;&#10;Once this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.&#10;&#10;As I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month. More to follow...&#10;&#10;"

Play your cards wisely to get rid of all the ghosts, undead, vampires, zombies and other spooky creatures haunting your mansion. Block your opponents while they're trying to drive spirits out of their home and into your backyard &ndash; but beware as the scariest ghosts will not be driven away so easily...&#10;&#10;In game terms, your goal in Ghooost! is to get rid of all of your cards in hand and in your mansion by playing a card (or several matching cards) equal to or higher than the one(s) played previously. To set up, each player has four ghost cards in hand and 4-12 cards in his mansion. Ghost cards come in four suits and have values ranging from 1 to 14, with a few cards having special powers; scary (red) ghosts, for example, can be topped only by fearless ghosts, other scary ghosts, or a ghost quartet, while fearless ghosts can be played no matter what's on top of the Cemetery (discard pile).&#10;&#10;A game consists of two stages. In the first stage, players draw or play cards to prepare their hand of cards for the second stage. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Play one or more matching cards on the Cemetery equal to or higher than the cards played previously, then refill your hand to four cards by drawing from the Crypt (deck).&#10;    Take all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand; any card can be played on an empty Cemetery.&#10;    Draw one card from the Crypt and try to play it, taking all the cards from the Cemetery into your hand if the play isn't valid.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once the Crypt is empty, the second stage begins and players take turns either playing valid cards into the Cemetery or taking all cards from the Cemetery into their hand. If a player plays two or three matching ghosts, he takes another turn immediately; if he plays four cards that match (or plays cards that complete a quartet), those cards and the Cemetery are removed from play, then he takes another turn. If a player's hand is empty, he draws the top card from his mansion, playing it if valid and taking all the Cemetery cards into his hand if not. If a player empties his hand and mansion, he's out and the others keep playing. Play continues until only one player has cards in hand; this player loses the game and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;Ghooost! includes a scoring system that allows for multiple rounds.&#10;&#10;"

Players must follow suit, can trump, etc. Every trick above 6 scores a point. There are also bonus points for Titles.

The value of that card means that only three others are in play. Deal out all the cards that are left. In turn a player may discard any pair in his hand on to the table, calling out, say, &quot;A pair of Maps&quot; or &quot;A pair of sixes&quot; and so on. Then the next player throws out a pair. If a player does not have a pair, he draws a card from the hand of the player on his right. Eventually, using this mechanic, all the cards will be matched as pairs except for the Monkey, the card drawn at random at the start.&#10;&#10;The player holding the Monkey at the end - quote &quot;rejoices in the pleasure of being called the 'Monkey'.
