It included elements of Auto Race and Monopoly and added complications such as planets moving in their orbits. The game took an enormous amount of time to play: 8 or 12 hours or even more.&#10;&#10;According to Widner: The reason it took so long is that it was a combination of a standard &lsquo;race&rsquo; game and Monopoly. One had to get to a planet and bring back a cargo in order to finance a trip to the next distant planet where a still more valuable cargo would be obtained, etc., out to Pluto, which harbored &lsquo;Immortality Dust,&rsquo; the game winner. The novel aspect was that the planets moved, making it difficult to land on one, plus such hazards as the &lsquo;negasphere&rsquo; (from E. E. Smith epics -- now known as a black hole) and pirates, to say nothing of falling into the sun, getting hit with space junk, etc.&#10;&#10;Years later, Bill Evans, Bob Pavlat, C. Stewart Metchette, and Ted White changed the rules enough to make it possible to play the game in an evening. It still didn't catch on.&#10;&#10;"

An orange ball is always set on the table, and the rest are white.&#10;&#10;Players start with 5 cards. When &quot;HIKE!&quot; is called, play begins. Each player passes a card to their left. Play continues until someone collects 5 cards of the same position (QB, RB, WR, CB, DL, LB). When this occurs, that player grabs the ORANGE ball in the center of the table and claims 6 points. This starts the FUMBLE! where the remaining players scramble to get one of the WHITE balls (one player is left without).&#10;&#10;Once the balls have been claimed, players take their &quot;kicks&quot; by bouncing their ball off the playing surface into the cup. The white balls are worth 3 points (a field goal) and the orange ball is worth for 1 point (an extra point).&#10;&#10;Example: In a 4 player game, Player 1 gets 5 cards of a kind first and recovers the orange ball, scoring 6 points. Players 2 and 3 each recover a white ball. Player 4 misses out on the fumble. Player 1 then &quot;kicks&quot; the orange ball for an extra point and players 2 &amp; 3 get a chance to kick a field goal for 3 points.&#10;&#10;(In a round a player can earn a max of 7 points)&#10;The first player to get 21 points, wins.&#10;&#10;"
