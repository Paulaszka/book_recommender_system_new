Warring human faction must choose to keep fighting one another or join forces to defeat the Alien invaders... or both... or side with the aliens to get help in defeating their human foes... or not.&#10;&#10;Day of Independence is a grand strategy game for 2 - 5 players set in an alternative steam-punky future. Each player plays a human power trying to take over the world. At some random point in the game Aliens may show up. The Aliens' true intentions are slowly revealed over time, and players must decide whether to fight the Aliens or not. Players choose actions that will make them either Collaborators with the Aliens or Resistance Fighters. The benefits and penalties of each decision depends upon the Aliens' true intentions. Lots of strategy, forced cooperation, and the ever present possibility of a knife in the back makes this game fun and different each time it is played.&#10;&#10;You live on an Earth that is a fractured world of rival human powers, struggling against each other for dominance&hellip; you know, the usual &mdash; like it&rsquo;s always been. Each unwilling to let other nations just chill.&#10;Culture, art, religion, language, population, and even military might have been reduced to a single quantified unit of influential power, called Influence.&#10;Advances in technology have allowed all economies and industries to rely on just three resources: Ever-Stones, a chewy red resource crystal especially good in stews and as a sealant for nuclear waste sites; Green Avoidium, an aromatic mineral green resource used to put off chores and unpleasant tasks until tomorrow, and; Un-salt, a yellow resource ore best described by what it isn&rsquo;t &mdash; it&rsquo;s not salt.&#10;Scientist the world over have postulated the possibility of extra-terrestrial life for centuries, but there has never been any proof that Aliens exist and no proof that they are heading to earth on a mothership filled with super-powerful weapons and a willingness to use them.&#10;So don&rsquo;t worry. There probably aren&rsquo;t any super advanced Aliens out there with incredible technology that could pose a threat to humankind. Just keep fighting amongst yourselves. If only you could capture enough territory to declare yourself Ruler of Earth, everything would be great. All problems would be solved and you could go to bed at night and sleep the sleep of the just, knowing that you are the winner, &lsquo;cause winning is all that matters.&#10;But, if Aliens came&hellip; they might Exterminate the human race, or maybe they would come to Enslave you all. If they knew the Earth contained the Resource of Interest that they have been scouring the Universe for, they might come to Mine the Earth dry. Or maybe they might just come to say &lsquo;hi&rsquo;, as part of their mission to Explore strange new worlds and seek out new life and new civilizations. Or maybe capitalism would be their bag, and they would come to Trade, with a special offer, just for you.&#10;But they probably don&rsquo;t exist, so just keep fighting amongst yourselves.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

320815,,"An ancient Chinese folk tale recounts that the Jade Emperor once held a feast to which he invited all the animals of the forest. Only twelve showed up. To reward his guests, the Jade Emperor announced that he would name a year of the Zodiac after each. The animals were all duly honored. But then the question of order arose. The Ox, the brawniest of all the animals but also the most dull-witted, insisted he should be first due to his tremendous strength. The Rat, puniest of all the animals but also the most cunning, argued he should be first due to his keen intelligence. The other animals, who possessed both strength and intelligence in varying degrees, soon joined the quarrel. Some sided with the Ox, saying that strength was more important than intelligence. Others sided with the Rat, saying intelligence was more important than strength. While still others wavered back and forth. So to settle the matter, the Rat proposed a contest.&#10;&#10;This game uses the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Each animal possesses its own unique combination of strength and intelligence. During the first phase, strength is crucial; in the second phase, intelligence is valued.&#10;&#10;The board starts off empty. The players alternately place their pieces on their sides of the board. Each piece must be placed on the unoccupied yellow spaces within their first three rows. The direction a piece is facing indicates which player it belongs to. After each player has placed all their twelve pieces, the game can begin. North, for having gone second during the set-up stage, gets to move first.&#10;&#10;An animal can not capture an animal stronger than itself. The animals are ranked in strength, from strongest to weakest: 12. Ox, 11. Tiger, 10. Dragon, 9. Horse, 8. Dog, 7. Goat, 6. Pig, 5. Snake, 4. Rooster, 3. Monkey, 2. Hare, 1. Rat.&#10;&#10;When an animal reaches the far rank, it is removed to the side and scored according to its intelligence. The animals are ranked in intelligence, from smartest to dumbest: 12. Rat, 11. Hare, 10 Monkey, 9. Rooster, 8. Snake, 7. Pig, 6. Goat, 5. Dog, 4. Horse, 3. Dragon, 2. Tiger, 1. Ox. As can be seen, an animal's intelligence is in inverse proportion to its strength. In other words, the weaker the animal the more valuable it is and vice-versa.&#10;&#10;Other than this, normal Checkers rules apply. Pieces can only move diagonally forward, either by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible.&#10;&#10;When one player is unable to make a move, by either having no more pieces left on the Checkerboard, or by having all his pieces blocked from movement, the game ends and the player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;Incidentally, through prudent and skillful play the Rat was able to easily defeat the brute efforts of the Ox. On the Chinese Calendar, the Year of the Rat is first, and Year of the Ox second to this very day.&#10;&#10;"

Patient Zero has been identified, and it's up to you to find the antidote as soon as possible to save the patient and humanity!&#10;&#10;Save Patient Zero pits two labs against each other. Each lab employs one or two scientists (i.e., players), while another player plays a lab computer named Savvy. The labs compete to identify an antidote of three molecules, with the labs typically sharing no information with one another; whichever lab finds the antidote first wins.&#10;&#10;The general idea of the game is to use lab tools in the best sequence possible to identify the three molecules out of 25 that make up the antidote. (These 25 molecules are arranged in a 5x5 grid on each lab's worksheet.) At the start of the game, Savvy looks at the top three molecule cards in that deck, then sets them aside. These are the molecules the labs must identify. On a turn, each lab submits a tool card to Savvy to show what they want to do in the round, and whichever lab submits first takes its action first in that round. Actions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Samply: Draw three sample cards from your lab's deck, and give them to Savvy. Each sample card depicts five molecules, and Savvy will identify which of them show at least one molecule used in the antidote.&#10;    Mikroskopo: Choose two cards from your lab's deck, and give them to Savvy, who will treat them like the cards in &quot;Samply&quot;.&#10;    Dedukto: Receive five molecule cards from Savvy. You (but not the other lab) now know these molecules are not in the antidote.&#10;    Centrofugo: Place your centrifuge on your lab worksheet so that it points to four molecules. Savvy then indicates whether any of these molecules are in the antidote.&#10;    Scanpad: Place a cardboard device on your worksheet to highlight six molecules in a 2x3 grid. Savvy then indicates how many molecules highlighted (0-3) are part of the antidote.&#10;    Spionado: Savvy takes two lab cards from the opposing lab that do not have any molecules in the antidote on them, then shows them to you.&#10;    Antidote: Circle three molecules on your worksheet. If all three are in the antidote, you win! If not, Savvy will indicate how many of the circled molecules are in the antidote.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each lab has a limited number of actions in its deck &mdash; eighteen total, with three Samply, two Dedukto, one Scanpad, two Antidote, etc. &mdash; so use them wisely, especially the Antidote because if you fail to identify the correct three molecules a second time, then your lab loses the game automatically.&#10;&#10;To play Save Patient Zero as a two-player game, each lab draws three molecule cards from the deck, and the opposing lab must identify these three molecules before you can identify the three molecules they drew. Each lab takes the role of Savvy for the opposing lab.&#10;&#10;"

This is not Brian Train's first or even second game about this conflict, and you might be wondering, what does this one have to offer? We think that the District Commander system - with its emphasis on bluff and deception, scarce resources and shifting operational goals - is an especially good fit for capturing the pace and nature of operations in Afghanistan.&#10;&#10;Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players build sequences of attacks and responses that resolve in reverse order, representing the ebb and flow of a theoretical fantasy fight scene two psychics are projecting into each other's minds. Planning your own moves isn't the only key to victory; you'll also use your psychic and magical abilities to manipulate when - or IF - actions resolve!&#10;&#10;Players select one of the four characters in a diverse cast of psychic combatants, using their unique skillsets to emerge victorious. Every character deck has its own strengths and weaknesses, with a depth of tactical play that ensures no two fights are the same.&#10;&#10;In Fight Sequence, players take turns playing Actions or passing, building a series of Actions until both players pass consecutively [with passes being forced once the maximum sequence size of 9 Actions is met]. Once that happens, the entire sequence then resolves in reverse order, starting with the last Action played. Timing your Actions for maximum effect is crucial, but every character has some ability to manipulate that timing to work more in their favor. Even the best-laid plans aren't foolproof!&#10;&#10;Actions are either attacks or responses - use your attacks to damage your opponent, and your responses to defend yourself from opposing attacks or support your strategy. Every card in the game can be played as either an attack or a response, so you're never out of options. Damage is represented by discarding cards from your deck; no paper, pen, dice, or tracker apps required. Just choose your characters, shuffle your decks, and begin!&#10;&#10;In addition to four varied characters with different styles and movesets, The First Chapter also includes the Academy decks, which use a more streamlined subset of cards to help ease players into the reverse-action-programming nature of the game.&#10;&#10;-- description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Rob casinos, Banks and jewelries from the biggest cities in the world. Gain millions and become a legend.&#10;&#10;---- ---- ----&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW:&#10;A seemingly simple action, such as choosing 1 die from a small common pool, becomes surprisingly multifaceted here. 1 die, only 1 die per round. And a maximum of 12 rounds available to create the perfect gang of specialists to perform 7 heists. Each Specialist requires 1 die to be recruited and 1 die to be activated. Obviously you would like to recruit 1 Specialist per round, because only having a large gang you can make the most profitable heists. You would also like to activate her/him, because she/he will provide you with the necessary equipment. But at the beginning of each round you will get that one, single die.&#10;&#10;You will therefore need to be able to recover other dice from bonuses or through the same effects of the specialists you have recruited. Ah, yes, the specialists ... If you have many with the same competence you can get very powerful activations and unlock unique skills. But it will be hard to perform the heists, because very different skills are required in each city. If, on the other hand, your gang is varied, you will have easier access to different casinos, banks or jewelries. But will the weaker activations be enough to provide you with dice, equipment and anything you need for the next rounds? &#10;Finally, remember that you are not alone at the table and that the other gangs are not sitting back.&#10;&#10;Which die to choose? How to create the best gang? Differentiate or specialize? Spend the dice or keep them for later?
