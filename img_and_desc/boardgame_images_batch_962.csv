317614,,"PTG College Basketball is an enjoyable full-play college basketball simulation game that offers some of the advanced gameplay that basketball aficionados will crave, while not sacrificing playability, so that it should appeal the more casual basketball fan, as well.&#10;&#10;Shots are now taken as a 2-pt Rim, 2-pt Jumper, or 3-Pointer. The rim shot is taken within a couple of feet of the basket. Assists are now looked at through the player actually taking the shot. Rebounds are resolved with a single roll and take both players into account. Probably, the biggest change is the stamina system. We have moved to a per possession over a time clock method. Every player and team are taken into account in the game clock. &#10;Every player is rated from the season. That is over 5,000 players!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Together, they try to hit reduction targets and provide the needed funding, knowing that each round they fail to do so they inflict severe damage on the planet. But bent on preserving their own country's wealth and following their secret agendas, none of them may be eager to give more than absolutely necessary.

A player takes a card and separates it from the rest and indicates what data must be located as indicated by the rocket pencil on the back of the removed card.&#10;How to play:&#10;When all the players are ready, one player turns over the top card of the deck. All players at the same time and without touching the card will have to search for the data. The first to say it out loud and cover the letter will get the letter set aside as a point.&#10;The letter that was face up is left to one side, but in this case face down in order to see what the rocket pencil indicates.&#10;The data to look for in the charts are the following:&#10; Red (number): the emotion that is repeated the number of times indicated by the card (joy, sadness, surprise or anger)&#10;Purple (sex): the largest group represented on the card (boy-girl). In the event of a tie, &ldquo;tie&rdquo; must be indicated.&#10;Blue (hair): it will be necessary to discover which hair color is the most numerous in the group of boys and girls on the chart.&#10;&#10;When there is only one letter left, it will be turned over to check what data to look for (what the rocket pencil marks).

You can start looking in the cards for hair color, the next game look for the majority in sex and in the third look for the coincidence in the number of repetitions of the same emotion that indicates the back of the card.&#10;&#10;Un juego para conocer y reconocer las principales emociones con diversos modos de juego&#10;&#10;"

The game is extremely portable (camping, lunch breaks, etc...) and there are lots of rule variations to adjust difficulty and length-of-play.&#10;&#10;Card Types:  There are 3 types of cards.  Ship Segments (used to build), Action Cards (used to create change), and Solar Flares (used to end the game).&#10;&#10;Set-up:  Determine who goes first and set the number of Solar Flares that will end the game - recommendation would be to match the number of players (3 players = 3 Solar Flares).  Take the 54 cards and spread-out/mix-up face down to create your junkyard.  Each player selects three ship segments from the junkyard - if you draw a Solar Flare or Action then simply reshuffle until you have three segments.&#10;&#10;Play: On your turn you grab one card from the junkyard and play it.  If it is a Ship Segment, connect to your ship-build or leave off to the side (all cards are played face-up).  If it is an Action Card, read out loud, execute the action, and return to the junkyard.  If it is a Solar Flare then set to the side face-up.&#10;&#10;Building: Building a ship is easy.  At the bottom of every ship segment is a color and shape.  Simply match the shape (&quot;star&quot; shapes are wild) to connect two pieces.  You can sequence and reposition your ship at any time in the game. &#10; Note that color matches are a scoring bonus.&#10;&#10;Endgame: Once the last Solar Flare is drawn, the game stops.  Everyone can organize their ship one last time before scoring.  Scoring is simple; front/back/cross-connector segments are worth 10 points, all other ship segments are worth 5 points.  If a connection matches in color, you get a bonus 5 points.  Highest score wins!&#10;&#10;Variation:  If you are playing with young kids, simply make building a ship based on color-match and all segments are worth 10 points.  To extend or shorten game length you can adjust the count of Solar Flare's needed.  You can also play extended sessions by stacking multiple games, until someone hits a predetermined score (first to 500 points wins).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Trick-taking card play is augmented by action cards allowing players set up large changes in the board state, and the presence of event cards introduces a small element of randomness. Whatever the methods, the goal is simple: connect your farm to the water source through a series of irrigation channels. How hard can it be?&#10;&#10;What is a coaster-based board game? &#10;Parched has dual functionality as a game and set of coasters. The game is housed in a wooden display case that is intended to live out on a coffee table or bar top, so that sealed, wooden game tiles are always within reach to hold a drink. This novel idea isn't a gimmick, though, the functionality is a logical offshoot of the story behind the game itself.&#10;&#10;The Story&#10;Reseco is a country with a rich history of brewing coffee and beer; however, recent drops in rainfall and redirection of water to a burgeoning kale and avocado industry are causing ripples across an increasingly arid landscape. The people are parched and so are their crops: beans and hops. Determining where the limited water gets directed is problematic, to say the least. Koffee Kings and Best Buds Hops find themselves at the center of the problem. They have come together to solve the issue using what they have on hand, drinking vessels and coasters, to negotiate the direction of irrigation channels on their overlapping properties.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Be the last one standing!&#10;&#10;This is a fast paced card game where people are trying to avoid financial bad habits and not go bankrupt.&#10;&#10;The game play is fairly simple.  There are as many Bankrupt cards in the deck  as there are players. Each player is trying to avoid having to pick up Bad Habit cards from the deck. The more financial Bad Habits you get the more cards you have to draw - with any one of them possibly being a Bankrupt card! If you get a Bankrupt card and don&rsquo;t have any Insurance that&rsquo;s it you are out of the game. Last person standing wins!&#10;&#10;Just to make it a bit more interesting the player who picks up a Bankrupt card gets to put it back in the deck - wherever they want. Watchout! Players also have the chance to pick up Attack or Defense cards that enable them to strike and counterstrike against the other players, change the order of play, skip a turn or even block another player&rsquo;s action, take a peek at cards coming up in the deck, steal another player&rsquo;s card, transfer some Bad Habits to another player... Remember though any Bad Habits that you pick up could send you Bankrupt. If you start to accumulate Bad Habits in your hand the more Bad Habit cards you will have to pick up!&#10;&#10;It is a bit different from other card games that you might be used to. The goal is really to not be picking up cards and making your opponents pick up as many cards as possible.

The more cards you pick up the greater the chance you will go Bankrupt!&#10;&#10;The deck is full of twists and turns in the game.

Eventually he realized that true wisdom is not achieved by keeping knowledge to yourself, so he decided to share his stories and inspire people with them &mdash; and believe it or not, that was how this game was made!&#10;&#10;In the trick-taking card game Anansi, you have to be smart about which tricks you are trying to get. Each trick represents a story, but stories untold are worth only a little. If you can acquire followers &mdash; by playing a card not to the trick, but for its indicated number of followers &mdash; you can match up your followers with stories to inspire them, and inspiring all your followers should always be your goal because this grants you the trickster's favor and sweet bonus points.&#10;&#10;Note that cards played to gain followers can affect the trump suit, which means that the trump can change several times in a game.

The Great Powers, using mercenaries gathered from all over Europe, have torn her to pieces. The borders of the Great Powers were constantly changing, and cities were passed from hand to hand like hunting trophies...&#10;&#10;In this strategic game, players need to build a common Game Area out of City Tiles and establish control over cities to gain more Victory Points.&#10; Key features: &#10;1) In the Core Game uses 42 unique City Tiles. Each City has 4 ways to connect to other Cities. Therefore, in each game, the players create a new Game Area.&#10;2) Instead of the usual resources (wood, stone, iron, etc.), the game uses mercenaries: Infantry, Shooters, Cavalry and Artillery. Each type of mercenary has 3 levels - the higher the level, the higher the ability of the unit. In total, there are 12 Unit Tokens in the game. Tokens have two sides and can be placed secretly. This creates huge opportunities for bluff and tactical combinations. &#10;3) The main way to obtain Unit Tokens is to create Political Ties between cities. The more complex the Political Ties, the more and better the Unit Tokens the player receives. This process is like playing Domino. Additionally, Unit Tokens can be bought or obtained free of charge upon conclusion of Alliances.&#10;4) The gameplay is divided into 5 Phases, which reflect the main aspects of the politico-military life of the Renaissance rulers and are consistently repeated in each Round. All phases are interconnected: the decisions made by the player in each phase have a definite influence on his subsequent actions. The strict sequence of phases allows players to carry out long-term planning. &#10;5) Each phase consists of several special actions available to all players. On a turn, the player cannot perform more than one action in a row. After each action, the turn is passed to the next player. All this speeds up of the gameplay, removes downtime and ensures high interaction between players. &#10;6) The competition of the gameplay depends on the skill of the players and their intentions. Usually errors are not critical if you are playing with players of your level. You can make up your failure to do some things by successfully doing others. &#10;7) The game can be completed in the First Round if at least one player can gain control of 5 or more Cities around their Capital City. Otherwise, the Round becomes the Final when there are fewer cities than the players.&#10;8) Victory Points are calculated only at the end of the game. Victory Points are awarded for different tasks, so there are different ways to achieve Victory. &#10;9) The Core Game (2-4 players) is a well-balanced strategy, with a simple and clear gameplay that can be easily mastered by casual players. However, the results of the game depend on the skills and experience of the player. &#10;10) Expansions increase the number of players to 5-6, and increase the depth and asymmetry of the gameplay.&#10;&#10;The game has adjustable gameplay complexity, modular design, high replayability and interaction. The game is especially suitable for players who like mechanics Tile Placement and Area Control.&#10;&#10;"

Adventurers have 15 days until the full moon rises and must grow their strength by defeating the creatures flooding into the land and acquiring upgraded weapons and armour.

The map tiles may be rearranged to a players preference, but it is recommended to play the first game with the original map layout with later gameplay randomly placing the tiles within the region. Monsters will be summoned each night based on the summoning cards drawn by players. The summoning cards will identify the level monster (Minion, Legionnaire, Pendragon) that will be summoned based on the player's level and the space for which a monster will be summoned. The type of monster will be determined based on the terrain tile that occupies the space identified on the summoning card.

If during her move she forms two sets at the same time, she obtains one point for each set.&#10;&#10;When all the tiles have been placed on the board, the player who has obtained the most victory points throughout the game wins.&#10;&#10;There is a variant to play with special tiles that allow actions such as stealing from an opponent, playing twice in a row or skipping an opponent.&#10;&#10;"

Each ADVENTURE GAME STARTER SET contains ten paintable plastic action figures in the standard 25mm size, a set of non-toxic water-based paints with instructions and brush, and a complete set of fast, playable rules for playing out your own fantasy adventures.  Even the gaming die is included. (For two or more players, ages 10 and up).&quot;&#10;&#10;Each contains two leaflets, one containing the rules and adventure; the other, a painting guide for the miniatures.  Though each game has a unique background story and series of encounters, the rules of play are identical.  On the last page of the rules leaflet is a promotion for Heritage's soon-to-be-released (at that time) RPG, Swordbearer.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of running two characters through a series of four encounters (combats).  Each side in a combat takes turns.  During a turn, all characters on the active side fight, then all characters on the active side may use magic, pick up or throw things, or run away.&#10;&#10;Fighting is resolved by cross-indexing the roll of a six-sided die with the letter code of the attacker's weapon (A, B, C or D) on a table corresponding to the defender's armor (which may be light, medium, or heavy) in order to find how much damage, if any, was done to the defender.&#10;&#10;The miniatures aren't necessary to play, and aren't even mentioned in the game rules.&#10;&#10;The Fighter's Fury - &quot;the adventures of a young knight and his friend as they do battle with Goblins, foul Orcs, a huge Troll, and an evil Baron in a quest to avenge the death of the young knight's father.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

As many new temples are built on the shores, you begin your spiritual journey to earn the favors of the Gods. Pick up precious artifacts while you sail up and down the Nile river, offer them to the monuments currently being built, and the Gods shall bless your travel!&#10;&#10;Each turn in Nile Artifacts, you move your ship forward, stopping at one of the nine ports and picking up one of the artifact cards available there. You may also pick up gold, which can be used to obtain more artifacts or to turn your ship around and sail the Nile in the opposite direction. Once every ship has arrived at one end of the Nile, players can make their offerings to the monuments currently in construction, each of them requiring a different type or combination of artifacts. Whenever a monument is completed, players receive victory points depending on the amount of donations they have made towards this particular monument.&#10;&#10;When offerings are done, the ships go back on the Nile to travel in the other direction and pick up more artifacts. Once the monument deck is empty, the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
