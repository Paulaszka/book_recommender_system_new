The deck is made up of action cards that let you steal cards like the grail from other players, force your opponents to pick up multiple card and shuffle up everyone's hands to name a few.&#10;&#10;The game gets more and more intense as each player battles it out to be the one in possession of the grail, all the time trying to work out how to get rid of the rest of their hand without the grail eluding their grasp.&#10;&#10;"

Eliminate the other player first, and you win! In the words of co-designer Eric Lang, &quot;'[Munchkin Collectible Card Game] is a very different game from Munchkin. Imagine all the awesome humor of Munchkin as a short, competitive head-to-head slugfest.&quot;&#10;&#10;The card game will be distributed as fixed two-player starter sets and randomized booster expansions.&#10;&#10;"

It&rsquo;s up to you and your team to discover which of the 12 suspects is the offender, where they are hiding, which weapon was used on the victim, and arrest him/her before the time runs out.&#10;&#10;In this game, each member of the team gets to play as one of Commonville's finest, exploring the city, consisting of tiles. Each tile contains either a suspect, evidence that can be used to eliminate suspects, or something to assist you in solving the case in time.&#10;&#10;During each round, each player will roll a varying amount of dice up to 3 times. You may then use the dice for movement (by matching the number on the destination tile), for gathering evidence (with any 4 consecutive dice), and for getting assistance (with any 3 matching dice). Donuts can be used to perform special dice actions (such as passing a die to another player). There is also a special blue Investigation die that can be used to perform actions rapidly (but only by the lead detective). After performing any actions, the team must move the time marker down a number of spaces equal to the number shown on the time die plus 1 minute for every wild 6 that was used for an action.&#10;&#10;There are 12 possible suspects in the game. Once you have collected enough evidence to eliminate 11 of them (and found the weapon that was used on the last victim), you must collect an Arrest Warrant from the Police Precinct and arrest the remaining suspect. If you can do all of this before time runs out, the team wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

It's easy to learn and has both recommended and randomized board arrangements.&#10;&#10;One player is a zombie master who controls a steadily growing horde of zombies. Every other player is a human who has been infected by the zombie virus. Humans have nine turns to get to a cure. Along the way they will gather weapons and events to help them survive.&#10;&#10;In a two/three player game, there is only one cure on the board and in a four player game there are two. This means that in a three/four person game, one human is always guaranteed to not get a cure. Humans will want to work together, at least somewhat in order to overcome the odds, but in the end, one person cannot be rescued, so humans may turn against each other to slow each other down.&#10;&#10;Each human begins with one random weapon and their turns consist of two movement phases and an attack phase, which they can use in any order. (Move/Move/Attack, Attack/Move/Move, Move/Attack/Move) A movement is one tile in a non-diagonal direction and an attack lets you use all of the ammo at your disposal during the attack phase. Each weapon has different properties and the ammo is reloaded each turn.&#10;&#10;When a human lands on a weapon tile, they add it to their inventory and are able to duel wield weapons. If they land on an event, they trigger it immediately. Some events persist throughout the game (like finding fast shoes, etc.) some are one time use (like finding a live grenade, etc.).&#10;&#10;The Zombie Master's turn begins by moving all of the zombies on the board. Different zombie types have different movement abilities. After moving existing zombies, he/she spawns new zombies to add to the board. Certain turns will also trigger a zombie event after the new zombies have been placed on the board. Zombie events are generally good for the Zombie Master, but expert humans can find ways to exploit certain zombie events.&#10;&#10;The players take turns until either all the cures have been acquired, or time runs out and none of the turns have been acquired or if the zombie master can zombify all the humans in the game.&#10;&#10;"

After drawing, the active player must take the final card they drew and may select one or both of the previous two cards drawn (if available). They then load these commodity cards on their boat.

Once a player's boat is full (seven cards with two players, five cards with 3-6 players), they are out of the round and the day is scored.&#10;&#10;Players score points for the value of their ships' holds, but also for the number of commodities of each type that they have stored in their warehouse. The highest earning merchant over three days wins the game. Some cards do not take up space on ships, while others contribute to the value of a hold, but cannot be stored in warehouses.&#10;&#10;This is the first game to be added to the Medici family of games since Strozzi, released in 2008.&#10;&#10;"

Three of the riders (black, red and yellow) have a special lap counter in their back wheel. These riders are moved with the three coloured dice on the outer lane (with roman numerals) and try to win a lap over their competitors. The game rules calls them &quot;Tempofahrer&quot;, which might be translated as &quot;endurance riders&quot;.&#10;&#10;The three other riders are sprinters. They race each other on the inner lane at given intervals and compete just for some points which count only in case of a tie in the number of laps won.&#10;&#10;There are the three coloured dice.&#10;&#10;These three dice are thrown in turns and the riders in the outer lane advance as many fields as dice mark their colour or their teammate's (three-coloured dice would have been enough and probably better). However, if in a turn none of the dice shows your colour(s), you fall back to the red square with no lap won.&#10;&#10;So you hope for a long run of throws with at least one of your colours to win a lap. And most often than not you get a bad throw when you have completed more than three quarters of a lap and you are very near your objective. That hurts!&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the sprinters wait their turn to play. At intervals (the rules are not particularly precise here) the coloured dice are put aside, the riders on the outer lane stay wherever they are, and a short sprint takes place between the three riders on the inner lane. No complicated rules here either, just throw and move, with a couple of penalty squares (2 -only reachable by a double one on the first throw- and 13). Teams whose sprinters land twice on these squares during the game (in different sprints, most probably) are penalized with one lap.&#10;&#10;The rules state that some player or onlooker can call a sprint anytime during the game for a special price he is willing to offer (a present for the winner of that sprint). Just like the &quot;primes&quot; in 6-day races.&#10;&#10;The player whose rider(s) perform best during the race by crossing the finish line first wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The entire box measures 22 x 17 x 12 cm. Not pocket-sized, but not too big either. There are 11 games inside, two in each drawer (with 2-sided, 4-folded game boards, except for one which contains the games: Dame, M&uuml;hle, and Puff (checkers, nine men's morris, and backgammon). There is a cycling board game, as well as a rowing and horse racing game.&#10;&#10;The cycling board game is labeled &quot;Radfahrt&quot; on the drawer, but is actually called &quot;Bicycleclub&quot; in the rules.&#10;&#10;The components / pieces are made from metal (cyclists, horses and row boats).&#10;&#10;Up to 6 players can take part and they can bet on the outcome of the race(s). The board measures 40 x 20 cms and is just a 50-square-long track without any particular indication on it, except for the arrow that tells us that the riders will move clockwise. Both the cyclists depicted on the board and the tin figurines included in the game have an unmistakable 19th century look. However, while the riders on the board look like racing cyclists, the tin figurines rather look like tourists.&#10;&#10;The rules are very simple. This is a betting game in which any number of players can take part. Players do not manage a particular rider but just bet on the outcome of the race. Players must agree upon the numbers of laps, and cyclists move according to the throw of dice. During their turn every player can move any cyclists since it is unknown who placed bets on which rider.&#10;&#10;In a way this has similar mechanics like games as like Heimlich &amp; Co. (hidden identity) and Reiner Knizia's classic horse racing game Winner's Circle (published by Alea) which also featured players making hidden bets during a race. After the race is over and the riders have finished the races, the players reveal their bets and he who placed the most accurate bets wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resource cubes necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. Scheming, dealing, and mutually beneficial agreements are key to success. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of cubes to use, resulting in an output of more cubes, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, and all kinds of resources.&#10;&#10;Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for cubes, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Confluence follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is almost all simultaneous play.&#10;&#10;Sidereal Confluence: Remastered Edition features the same gameplay as the first edition of the game from 2017, but features an updated card layout, a teaching guide, and an improved rulebook for easy set-up and learning with more visual examples and clear key terms.&#10;&#10;"

The tribe to score 15 points first wins the game.&#10;&#10;Solo mode, with the addition of Rise of Tribes: The Vul'Keth Invasion (required and sold separately), is a very challenging way to play Rise of Tribes.&#10;&#10;Rise of Tribes - Microbadges&#10;&#10; Rise of Tribes fan&#10; Rise of Tribes fan&#10;&#10;"

Gameplay revolves around a momentum-based system that allows the player with the momentum to continue to take actions until they lose momentum, at which point their opponent picks up and continues.&#10;&#10;Players use resources to supply their gladiators with equipment and minions (support characters). The crowd gets involved through cheer and also provides an alternate victory condition.

To begin play, each player is dealt four cards. In a unique twist, players can win the game in one of two ways. Players win as a Hipster by having no cards in their hand at the end of their turn. Players win as a Hamster by having eight (or more) cards in their hand at the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;There are four card types. Object cards serve as simple discards. No action is taken when Object cards are played. Action cards trigger the action shown on the card when played, helping players eliminate, or accumulate, cards. Calamity cards can be played at the start of an opponent&rsquo;s turn, forcing the opponent to take the action on the Calamity card. Comeback cards can be played on Calamity cards, in which case it becomes the turn of the person playing the Comeback card. Depending on the Comeback card, that person either takes the action on the Calamity card, or ignores it, before starting their turn.&#10;&#10;Despite its pick-up-and-play game mechanic, Hipsters and Hamsters is filled with dynamic and precisely-balanced strategy, as opposing sets of victory conditions cause players to flip between playing styles in reaction to draws and opponent actions, all while attempting to control turn order to alter the flow of play.&#10;&#10;In the Basic game, players do not declare which character style (Hipster or Hamster) they are playing as and can switch between styles at any time, as many times as they wish, allowing them to adjust their strategy on-the-fly. In the Advanced variant and Team play, players declare their character style in advance and receive bonus points for winning the round as their declared character.&#10;&#10;"

This is an 18xx style train game that begins in 1848 and ends in 1980.  There are nine public trolley car companies and one government controlled company.  The game also includes eight private companies that are auctioned off at the beginning of the game.  Players struggle to keep their trolley car companies from falling into the government controlled railroad.  The game ends when the $12,000 bank runs out of funds.  The player with the most personal money plus stock share value wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game has eight phases. The first permanent trolley car is the '8'.  Phases 4 and 5 represent the Great Depression and revenue declines during this period of the game in which brown tiles are available.  Brown tiles only contain one station space.  Upgrading a two station space green tile to a single station space brown tile removes a station marker from the board, which simulates trolley companies shrinking during these two phases.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that a board of directors (3 players) controls the government railroad, which is determined by the player that controls the priority deal card from the previous stock round.  This will change at the end of each stock round assuming a different player holds the priority deal card.&#10;&#10;"
