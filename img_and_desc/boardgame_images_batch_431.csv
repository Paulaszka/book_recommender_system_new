Since 1947, Pakistan and India have been military rivals and have fought several wars. Those wars, however, have been inconclusive. Since 1998, both nations have become nuclear powers and, consequently, the next Indo-Pakistani war could potentially become nuclear. Indeed, another war between Pakistan and India may be the final showdown.&#10;&#10;Showdown utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From attack helicopters to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. Showdown also introduces a new and disconcerting element: tactical nuclear weapons. Both Pakistan and India now have sizeable nuclear arsenals, and thus what begins as a conventional war may erupt into a nuclear exchange.&#10;&#10;In Showdown, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses likely to be sustained during another Indo-Pakistani war. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management, particularly with regard to nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;"

Since 1953, the Korean peninsula has remained devoid of open war, though only South Korea has prospered during that time. In contrast, North Korea has become isolated, bankrupt and confrontational. Indeed, as the North Korean economy continues to implode, and more starvation ensues, it's conceivable a desperate North Korea could resort to war to try to avoid its own final collapse.&#10;&#10;DMZ utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns.

German soldiers were continuing to fight stubbornly throughout Europe, even after Germany's defeat became a certainty; so US commanders had every reason to worry resistance on German soil would be tenacious. In the city of Aachen itself, the street fighting was expected to be severe, just as it had been in other hard-fought cities. The situation along the border itself was even worse; the infamous West Wall loomed in front of Aachen, enclosing the city with miles of concrete bunkers, casemates and &quot;dragon's teeth.&quot; The sense of foreboding among the GIs assigned to the attack, as well as their commanding generals, was evident and warranted.&#10;&#10;Aachen utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to fighter-bombers, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by anti-tank guns &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy regiment of engineers defending a road junction. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the road junction, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Aachen, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting in Aachen.

Hence three US divisions were scheduled to invade Saipan on 15 June 1944, supported by nearly two-dozen battleships that had begun a bombardment two days before. More than 30,000 fanatic Japanese were entrenched on the island, dug into caves and other formidable defensive positions. The battle for Saipan proved to be one of the fiercest battles of the Pacific War, and the deadliest up to that time for both sides.&#10;&#10;Saipan utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn.

The ever-resourceful Rommel, however, simply led the Afrikakorps still deeper into the desert, going around Bir Hacheim. Once behind the Allied defenses, the panzers became a threat to the overall Allied position. British tank units were immediately ordered to counterattack Rommel's panzers, resulting in one of the largest tank engagements of the desert war on a barren tract of desert that became known as the &quot;cauldron.&quot;&#10;&#10;Cauldron utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the battle.

The skill of the Hun horsemen, particularly their accuracy with the composite bow while mounted, made them a veritable shock army. They continued to bring victory after victory to Attila, making him the master of Central Europe. After years of conquest, oppression and extortion, however, Attila's recent invasion of Western Europe would be challenged: a remnant Roman army, under the command of Flavius Aetius, was sent to stop him on a field known as the Catalaunian Plain, near the village of Chalons.

This path is slowly uncovered by the player by asking prisoners that can be found randomly through the maze. Also, the Maziacs will appear randomly and try to kill the hero, but as long as he has a sword, he'll be safe.

It may also be used to explore the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; inherent in the situation had the German high command chosen to react to the Allied landings in a much different manner: making that effort&rsquo;s defeat Berlin&rsquo;s main strategic goal for late 1943 (Operation Wacht am Tiber). The design therefore combines factual historical detail with studied counter-factual analysis to present players with a situation that will be familiar to most of them, while at the same time allowing for an easy and seamless transition into the less certain realm of alternative history.&#10;&#10;Each extra-large-hex on the 34x22&rdquo; mapsheet equals 11 miles (18 km) when measured from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents between two and 15 days, depending on the exact time of year of each one. That is, as the autumn weather worsens, and attrition and the inevitable declines in soldier morale and force-robustness take their tolls, each game turn comes to represent a longer period of time. That approach allows for the smooth building into the system of what would otherwise be burdensome factors of weather, ground conditions, operational tempo, etc. Every ground unit represents a division or division-equivalent (176 large-size NATO-style).&#10;&#10;The game uses the well-liked system originally created by Ben Knight for Victory in Normandy. There are approximately 14,500 words in the rules. A complete game of SU generally takes from four to five hours to complete, and it&rsquo;s suitable for solitaire play. Rules cover such things as: Allied end-run second invasions, Luftwaffe seaport raids, reinforcements, withdrawals, paratroop drops, naval gun support, both sides&rsquo; army and corps organizational schemes, German tactical superiority, tactical and strategic airpower and much more. The turn sequence is as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;I. Allied Player Turn&#10;&#10;A. Allied Reinforcement Phase&#10;&#10;B. Allied Command Point Expenditure Phase&#10;&#10;II.

(L&rsquo;41), designed by Joseph Miranda, is a two-player alternative history wargame of intermediate complexity that simulates a hypothetical German attempt to seize the city of Leningrad in late July through August 1941. The assumption is Manstein, rather than pausing for two weeks as he did historically, simply charged ahead into the city immediately upon crossing the Luga River.&#10;&#10;To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander&rsquo;s-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length. The German player is generally on the offensive, trying to clear the Soviet defending force from the city prior to the end of the game. L&rsquo;41 uses the system originally created for our earlier published Manila&rsquo;45 game.&#10;&#10;Each game turn equals three days. Each hexagon on the map represents 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for the Germans are mainly battalions, while those for the Soviets range from battalions to regiments and brigades. Thus each unit may represent anywhere from 100 to 5,000 men and their equipment.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: fog of war, replacements, reinforcements, defensive fire, indirect fire, combat air support, command control, leaders, fanaticism, gunboats, the cruiser Aurora, the Komsomol, the metro, and optional German airborne assault.

Getting the Captain's Hat allows you to have a good bit of control, but watch out for Scurvy and Shackles, which will keep you from winning. Grab lots of Booty keepers, maybe some Ships, and expect a few new Surprise cards along the way. (From playing the game demo at Origins 2010)&#10;&#10;A pirate themed variant of Fluxx, this game is much like the original. Simply follow the rules that are currently in play. Start by drawing a card and playing a card, but even those can be changed. There's no way to win at the begining, but once a Goal card is played, you have to play the appropriate Keeper cards in front of you or play other cards to keep them away from everyone else, like Steal a Keeper or play a new goal card to replace the old one.&#10;&#10;New to Fluxx are the Surprise cards which can be played at any time to cancel certain plays or steal a keeper as played.&#10;&#10;"

It allows for space combat in worlds where ships tow each other by grappling hooks or by tractor beams, where space marines board by teleporting onto the other ship or by laser-cutting open holes in the hull, and where faster-than-light travel happens by a single instantaneous jump, or by traveling days in a warp bubble that allows ships to chase and fight each other while racing at speeds beyond comprehension.&#10;&#10;"
