These events, created by the world&rsquo;s greatest magicians, are pulse-pounding, unpredictable and timed. Each player will need to make use of every round they have available to them, either trying to complete the main objective or grabbing &ldquo;Arcane Keys&rdquo; that are scattered around the environment for some vital extra points. The last player will take on the special role of Storyteller, who uses the prewritten adventures (or their own) to run the story the other players participate in. They function as a referee of sorts, playing all the NPCs and baddies in the combat (in Dice Odyssey, the Storyteller will try to defeat the heroes in combat by choosing a good combination of baddies and selecting their actions carefully).  The game is composed of 2 main systems, Exploration and Combat.&#10;&#10;EXPLORATION SYSTEM&#10;Each adventure will give the players a set number of rounds to complete it in. When a player takes a turn, he will tell the Storyteller what he plans to do, it&rsquo;s up to the Storyteller to gauge how many rounds it would take to accomplish it. Another simple element that makes this game feel completely unique are the Arcane Keys. They are collectables that are scattered everywhere, each one having some sort of puzzle or trial involved in getting to it. The Arcane Keys allow more opportunities for each person on the team to be helpful. For example, if the main objective requires Stealth and Athletics, then the Arcane Keys that are close by, will be Wits and Lore based. At every moment, all attributes are useful, and Arcane Keys are the main reason why.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player attempts to do something difficult, they will have to roll dice to see if they are successful. The number of dice they roll is determined by the attribute the Storyteller says is needed for the task and how many of that type of Attribute Card they have. For example, if a player needs to push a large sleeping giant out of the way, the Storyteller will tell him it will take an athletics roll, and what number he will have to roll to be successful, in this case, a 6. The player will look to see if he has an athletics Attribute Card, and will roll an additional die for each that he has. The base roll being 3 dice. There are 8 attributes; Athletics, Dungeoneering, Fortitude, Lore, Luck, Stealth, Vigilance and Wits. On each Attribute Card there is also some sort of boon, perhaps for Fortitude, a hero may have &ldquo;Bark Skin&rdquo;. This element can be used creatively to help the player throughout the quest, and ultimately is up to the Storyteller. Generally, the rule is, if they can explain how they are using it for a task, they can convert the Attribute Card to a different type. Using the card above &ldquo;Bark Skin (Fortitude)&rdquo;, a player hides next to a tree after stripping down. This could convert the Attribute Card from Fortitude to Stealth for the use of that one roll.&#10;&#10;COMBAT SYSTEM&#10;In most RPGs, heroes have some base stats that do not change, such as HP, defense, attacks, etc. But in Dice Odyssey, players can change their heroes &ldquo;base stats&rdquo;. Imagine a normally defensive, tough hero, who is putting his guard down to do extra damage this turn, in Dice Odyssey, that means he would have chosen a different Combat Card this turn. Players begin combat by assessing the baddies they are fighting, their teammates strengths and weaknesses and from that, what Combat Card would be most appropriate. Most heroes have 5 different Combat Cards, and can swap between those cards during the game by buying them at the store.&#10;&#10;After the baddies have been laid out, the players will also each grab 4 of the dice from their bags and roll them to see which of their Loot Cards they can use this round of combat. Each point rolled on a die, will allow the player to activate that many points on the corresponding Loot Card. For example, if they roll a 1 on a Fey die, they can pick which Fey card they want to activate (if they have more than one) and then pick which of the 3 (1 point) powers they want to use. If they were to roll a 2 instead, they could choose 2 (1 point) powers on that card. The Loot Cards serve as an add-on to the player's Combat Card. After 2 uses the Loot Cards break, at which point, you have to discard it and put one of your dice of that type back in the main bag. &#10;There is more to the combat system, but this covers most of it.&#10;&#10;CONCLUSION&#10;If the players are able to finish the main quest in the time allotted, they receive a point for each Arcane Key they were able to escape with. Depending on how many points they have, the heroes will be in 1st &ndash; 5th place. The actual victory is if they are able to complete the mission at all, the bonus points serve as a high score mechanic. It is also fun to replay the same quest to see if you can get the number one spot!&#10;&#10;"

He left the house through the garage, we know that he has been there from the mess he leaves behind.

You and a particular co-worker at the Arcane Bakery simply cannot work together anymore. In a moment of frustration, you challenge them to a duel: After close, no holds barred. The loser resigns. And cleans up the mess.&#10;&#10;Arcane Bakery Clash is a resource management game, where your resource is time. Specifically, time to cook the magical treats that you will use against your co-worker. You can choose 2 actions per turn, and you will either put a recipe card in the oven, peek into an oven (in case you forgot what you started cooking), turn up the heat (and advance the track on the back of a recipe card), or take a recipe out of the oven (putting the card into play). With these actions you will bake new treats that are used to either reduce your opponent&rsquo;s health, heal yourself, or allow special actions. When a player&rsquo;s health is reduced to zero, they lose the game, and their opponent wins.&#10;&#10;"

The game was developed on a public forum and accepted input from users through two major revisions until a final publication date.&#10;&#10;Play uses many methods common to traditional wargaming.  Movement and distances are presented in &quot;inches&quot; and determined with the use of a tape measure.  Modified six-sided dice rolls are used to determine many outcomes.  Various arena tokens are used to denote alterations to the battlefield that occur during play.&#10;&#10;Each player controls the units of an opposing force.  Forces are built using a points pool.  As these calculations can become rapidly tedious, numerous armies and forces are provided by a variety of forum users.&#10;&#10;Each unit in each force is represented by a model that is placed on the play surface.  Models have a paper record that tracks various statistics and play values such as speed, armor, ammunition, and so forth.  Units may make attacks on opposing units as long as they have the range, remaining ammunition or power, and line of sight.  Successful attacks deal damage that may destroy, disable, or partially disable targets.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in alternating player turns, each half-turn being sub-divided into movement, fire, and assault phases.  Victory conditions are set before the scenario begins and typically involve force destruction or &quot;capture the flag&quot; goals.  Rules disputes are resolved by a simple die throw.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

(ETF!) is a multiplayer set collection card game for 2-6 players (13 and up) and takes 30-60 minutes to play.  In ETF! players (attendees) take turns trying to complete objectives (responsibilities) in order to leave the festival and not lose themselves in it. The first attendee to take care of all their responsibilities or with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each round (day) brings new rules to observe. Some of the other attendees may be looking for the same responsibilities as you making it harder for you to take care of them. Other attendees may just continue to remind you of how many other responsibilities you have, causing you to stay on the festival grounds longer. You may even make some drastic choices that can help or harm you on your journey. All these things will ensure that no two festivals will feel the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

It's a simultaneous action game where players play a progressing amount of colored cards in order to acquire unclaimed artifacts and relics, in a complex, and fun game of prediction, observation, and thought.&#10;&#10;Game play takes place over the course of six rounds.  In each round player try to acquire cards that give them end game points, and special abilities.  The objective of the game is to score the most points at the end.&#10;&#10;Each round is separated into four phases.  In the first phase, players place three of their colored cards from their hand in front of them, face down.  Then everybody reveals their cards.&#10;&#10;Next, everybody places two cards down in front of them, and then reveals those.  Then players play one final card face down and reveal that one, for a total of six revealed cards.  Finally, there is a resolution phase where the players determine who has the largest amount of dominant, and sub-dominant colors for each of the available artifacts, and they are divided up accordingly.&#10;&#10;Players have the same hand of 15 cards throughout the course of the game, thus limited luck.  The 15 cards a comprised of five colors, with three cards of each color.  Once a card is played during a round, it is put back in a player's hand at the end of the round and can be played again.&#10;&#10;On each artifact card this is a dominant, and sub-dominant color.  The card goes to the player that has played the most color cards that match the dominant color.  In the case of a tie, the player with the largest number of color cards played that match the sub-dominant color gets the card.  The reason the game is complex and fun is, there are many different dominant and sub colors on the board at the same time, and people have to predict what other people are going for based on set collection, and the optimization of color specialization.&#10;&#10;The game ends after six rounds.  The person who wins is the person with the most number of points, which is determined by how much of a type a player has in each of their sets, and how many gem relics they have.&#10;&#10;"

Players are given a secret loyalty card, assigning them as a Traitor, Loyal, or the Heir in hiding. Loyals win by rooting out and eliminating the Traitors, or passing five Quests to safely herald in the new King. Traitors win when four Quests fail, or by finding and assassinating the Heir. Players will scheme, deceive, and persuade in order to complete their objectives.&#10;&#10;Each round, players contribute Knowledge cards in secret towards a Quest. Knowledge that matches the colour of the Quest will increase the chance of it passing, whilst off-colour cards increases the chance of failure. Players may vie for powerful Court cards, plot assassinations, or simply pass their action while they garner information. Play continues until the Loyals win and the Heir is safe, or the Traitors win and the Kingdom is left to ruin. As the game progresses, tensions will rise. Players will resort to accusations and assassinations in a last ditch effort to save the Kingdom, or force its destruction.&#10;&#10;Act of Treason was inspired by social deduction games like Mafia, Werewolf, and Battlestar Galactica. It takes many aspects of these games and seeks to amplify what makes them so much fun: the social interaction, suspicion and deception! In Act of Treason, the only thing that stands between you and victory is your ability to read, bluff, and persuade others.&#10;&#10;"
