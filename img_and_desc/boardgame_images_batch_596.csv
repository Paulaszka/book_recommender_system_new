The object of the game is to work together to build as many of the seven rainbows as possible. The game may be lost if players are not able to complete a rainbow, but this game is designed to be a positive game that focuses on improving and not so much the negative connotations of losing. Players work to improve their score from their last game. Though cooperative, players have limited table talk and must coordinate their card plays based on what cards they can see on the table.&#10;&#10;A fun game suitable for all ages.&#10;&#10;"

Now's your chance. It only takes you two hours to finish your data entry, but management doesn't know that. Do you really want to make copies of copies all day? Why not work on your novel and brine pickles in the bathroom instead? You&rsquo;re pulling a paycheck either way. At the end of the day, players that didn't complete their tasks will be reprimanded, unless of course they can play an excuse to get out of it. Watch out for Wednesday, though, as there's always something that goes wrong on hump day.&#10;&#10;&#10;No Benefits is set in an average workplace, where players are average employees trying to get through the daily grind. You need to balance not getting fired with working too hard, in order to finish the week as the least productive worker.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most slack by the end of the 5 day working week (5 turns).&#10;&#10;Each turn, players will be given an assignment from the day's inbox by the current Assistant Manager. On Wednesdays, crisis cards are also drawn and dealt with. Players can then play morning memos, plan their workday by selecting Grind cards to play, and then revealing their selected cards to show their progress towards their assignments. Players with incomplete assignments can plead their case with excuse cards. Without an excuse, players receive a write-up, and are fired if they gain 3. Finally, any late memos are resolved and that round's slack scores are tallied up.&#10;&#10;The game involves a careful balance between putting off work for points, or doing work to gain sway and perks from your superiors.&#10;&#10;"

Celtillus tried to assert authority to organize and ally the disparate tribes against Roman incursions, but tradition and habit were against him and he was killed by his own people. But strife with Rome worsened, and his son elected to try again for tribal unification to survive against the two threats of voracious Rome and ambitious Julius Caesar. The son negotiated, inspired, made alliances, and finally took on the traditional title of &quot;supreme warlord&quot; that his father had died reaching for.&#10;&#10;That title was &quot;Vercingetorix,&quot; and he bore the title so well that people today think of it as his name (which we do not know).

This offering, Guderian Crosses the Desna 1941, is focused on the German attack to start the great encirclement of Kiev.&#10;&#10;This battle starts on 25 August 1941, just after General Guderian goes to visit Hitler to convince him to allow the German Army to attack Moscow next.  Hitler decides that he wants to try and capture Kiev next.  He is mesmerized by the rich farmland and industry there.  Hitler manages to convince Guderian that Kiev is a better target.   When Guderian gets back he sets his troops in motion.  Their first test is to capture a major highway bridge over the Desna at Novgorod-Seversky.  His advanced elements fail to take the bridge in a coup-de-main on the 25th.  They regroup and make a more deterined effort the next day.  Aided by some inept Red Army bridge guards the Germans succeed and they establish a bridgehead.  On the 27th they must endure some minor counter-attacks.&#10;&#10;This is a stand alone game and an excellent introduction to the Armored Knights game system. Three scenarios detail the actions of the 3 days of battle.  The first scenario is small and short.  It's a race to the bridge in the German attempt to capture it in a coup de main.  The second scenario is the full 3 day battle.  The last scenario is the German bridgehead forces trying to hang on and expand the lodgement.&#10;&#10;The force structure is small enough for a great solitaire game and introduction to the game system.  System basics are an I-Go U-Go system with units being able to conduct overruns and engage in combat.  Unit strengths vary as a result of what supporting arms you stack with the battalion sized units.  Main combat units are infantry, artillery, and armor battalions.  Supporting arms such as recon, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, military intelligence, and engineers are built as companies.  Players are able to provide Close Air Support to aid the ground pounders and leaders like General Model even play a part in providing your troops with their best chance of success.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 2-4 hours&#10;    Hex: 1.24 miles / 2.0 kilometers&#10;    Units: Company to Battalion&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Four 11 x 17&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;    One dual-side printed countersheet (216 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 26-page Guderian Crosses the Desna rulebook&#10;    Three scenario setup charts&#10;    Nine Player Aid Cards&#10;    Two 10-sided dice&#10;    One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;(from publsher's website, box and user's desciption)&#10;&#10;"

He would later walk across numerous other times and entertain the crowds by crossing blindfolded, on stilts, or with his manager on his back.&#10;&#10;Game board shows an amusing scene with a tight rope stretched across a river flowing down from a waterfall. Directions for the game state &lsquo;Ben&rsquo;, who stands on the cliff dressed in the sailor suit has already crossed safely.  The four walkers still attempting to get to the other side by way of the rope are named Ez, Uncle Tom, Fatty Fisk, and &lsquo;the expert Blondin&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The game board also shows people falling from the tight rope and landing in the water below.  These are named in the directions too.  Ebenezer is tumbling into the water, only Nebuchasnezzar&rsquo;s feet are shown as he sinks below the water, Ezekiel is swimming to shore, and Jeremiah is said to be going up the ladder.&#10;&#10;The boat in the scene is named as well.  Commanded by Uncle Sam and carrying a small African-American boy, the boat represents the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau.  This agency was created in 1865 to help the newly freed slaves.  With the tight rope bridging the gap, and the dangers of failing, the game is seen to give subtle references to the post civil war era.&#10;&#10;Tight Rope is played by the spinning the indicator (earlier edition - rolling the two dice).&#10;&#10;To step on the rope (place his piece on space 1), a player must spin a 1.  To move across to number 12, a player must then spin the next number to where his piece rests.  This is done by spinning two times in a row.  If a player does not spin the number needed to move his piece one step ahead, the player then moves down the grid.  Whenever he spin the number needed (no matter how far down the grid he is), he moves to the number near the rope.  If the player does not spin the needed number and is in the last space below his numbered step, he moves back one step.&#10;&#10;The first player across wins!&#10;&#10;"

A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.&#10;&#10;Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).&#10;&#10;Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.&#10;&#10;If a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.&#10;&#10;"

If a face card shows up, it counts as a guard and is placed face-up on the table; any other card counts as cash and is placed in front of the player. (An ace also allows the player to look through one stack, then reshuffle it.) At any time during the round, a player can cash out, scoring one point for each pip on the cards in front of her and one point for each card face-up on the table, whether cash or guards.&#10;&#10;If a second guard shows up in a suit, then the round ends and no one still in the round scores for the cash in front of them.

If this card is an Influence card, they can then place it under one of the VludKin, altering their Influence value based on the Clan type shown on the card. If it's a Power card, then they can carry out the special action on that card before it is discarded.&#10;&#10;Failing to win a card will earn the VludKin a -1 Influence token to their total, and they can get rid of these only through trading an Influence card matching their Clan or the use of certain power cards, which might actually move all the tokens to an enemy instead. If an Influence card is failed, then the other player gets a chance to win it. If a Power card is failed, then the power is automatically played by the enemy VludKin opposite; sometimes it's in your advantage to fail a Power card...&#10;&#10;During the game, the stacks of cards under each VludKin are built, changing their Influence up and down over turns until the game ends and the player with the lowest VludKin loses. With the ability to play Influence cards on the other player's VludKin and with the use of Power cards to move Influence cards around the stacks, a level of strategy is added to the simple core rules.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a VludKin reaches ten Influence or the central deck is empty, so through the use of Influence and Power cards a tense game builds in which the balance of Influence can change right up to the end on the asymmetrical board game playfield. There is little down time for the players and no hidden hands of cards, so this provides an exciting head-to-head experience.&#10;&#10;VludKin ClaNz comes with eight VludKin from four ClaNz, two copies of each of the twelve different power cards, and forty Influence cards.

Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose.

Those heroes will be attacking your Den. Each turn a Monster is Summoned and you will have to place one of your minion tokens on one of your heroes that have that monster symbol. If you complete a card by filling all the monster, traps, and spells symbols you defeat that hero and can claim it as a reward by imprisoning him/her into your dungeon cell. Some heroes provide a special reward when defeated... from adding an extra monster to getting a special Overlord ability.&#10;&#10;After placing minions a die is rolled to determine if a type of hero attacks. To repel an attack you can remove monsters from that hero card for a value equal, bigger or lower than the hero attack (defined by the roll of 1D6). If you repel the complete attack you are undamaged. If you repel a portion you can get the rest of the damage by reducing your life (which begins with 10). Also you can simply nullify the attack of a hero by distracting them with one of your treasures. Spells can be used to change the summoned monster type and Traps can nullify any attack (even if they are not in the card of an attacking hero).&#10;&#10;When the 6th hero is collected by any player the game is over and the scoring phase begins.

Si completas todos los slots de la carta derrotas al heroe y puedes reclamar la recompensa aprisionandolo en una celda. Algunos heroes proveen recompensas especiales cuando son derrotados... desde otorgar un monstruo extra a darle al Overlord una habilidad permanente.&#10;&#10;Luego de colocar los minions se tira un dado para determinar el tipo de heroe que atacara. Para repeler un ataque se pueden remover monstruos de la carta de dicho heroe por un valor igual, superior o inferior que el ataque del heroe (definido por un D6).

The last card is placed onto the table.&#10;&#10;The oldest player begins. He multiplies a couple of his cards and then announces the result.&#10;&#10;Example : the first player has cards 2, 5 and 8. Consequently he can associate 3 couples of cards : 2 and 5, 2 and 8, 5 and 8. He chose the first and declares : &quot;10&quot;.&#10;&#10;His opponents have to deduce which couple it is.&#10;&#10;Example : to obtain 10, you can either have the 2 and the 5, or the 1 and the 10. In that case, the second player has the 1 : thus he validates the first hypothesis.&#10;&#10;Players take turns in a clockwise direction declaring a multiple, until one player has identified which card is on the table. He says &quot;Deductio&quot; and declares the number of the hidden card without showing the card to the others. If he is right, he scores a point. If he can identify the cards in each player's hand without any mistake, he scores a bonus point, and the hand is over. If he is wrong, he loses 1 point and the hand goes on.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 10 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Experienced&#10;&#10;Play with 4 cards or more following the same rules. The number of possible couples (for example, 6 couples for 4 cards) and the multiples related to each value increase.&#10;&#10;In turns, each player can play the joker card. He puts it in front of him and turns it face down once used. It will allow him to pass his turn once without declaring any number. It can be played at any time.&#10;&#10;"

In the game, you roll dice to obtain gems from the mine. Gain the most valuable collection of gems, and you'll be crowned the new dwarf king!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you draw two random gems from the bag and place them on the table. You then roll four six-sided dice. Certain gems require a certain number sequence in order to mine them; roll that sequence, and you can take all the gems of that type! As the game progresses, more and more gems will be added to the table, giving players choices as to which gems they want to try to mine. Sometimes you'll need to press your luck in order to succeed.&#10;&#10;Once the bag runs out of gems, you enter the final round, with players needing to do their best to snag the last gems.&#10;&#10;"

Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first title in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world in which most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors, with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition, but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective, which could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for their own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games, a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what's best for the colony and what's best for themselves. The rulebook also includes a fully co-operative variant in which all players work toward the group objective with no personal goals.&#10;&#10;"

When encountering an Allied Formation, play temporarily stops in order to resolve the Combat Sequence, with the game system generating forces that your own forces will have to defeat.&#10;&#10;"

One player (the IDF) is assigned the role of the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) commander, and the other player is assigned the role of the Hezbollah forces, as well as Syrian and Iranian forces if certain events occur to cause their entry into the game (or players may agree to have these additional forces in the mix from the beginning of the game instead).&#10;&#10;The game map features northern Israel and southern Lebanon, divided into 21 large hex territories, representing three categories of terrain: Urban (a major population center, such as the cities of Tyre, Sidon and Nabatiye), Populated (full of villages and small towns, and numerous roads), and Remote (rough terrain with few inhabitants or roads.) Stacking in any hex zone is unlimited, and units move and conduct operations within these hex zones to win the game.&#10;&#10;"
