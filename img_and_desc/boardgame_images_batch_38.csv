All players are involved in every player's turn, so there is no &quot;down time.&quot; In essence, while one player is robbing a bank, the others become the Law Enforcement aspect of the game, trying to stop him with roadblocks, tear gas, gun molls, tommy guns, and whatever else they can throw in his path.&#10;&#10;If the Bad Guy (there are 20 historical &quot;Bad Guys&quot; from Dillinger, to Jelly Nash, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the incredible Barkers, the inept Kelly's, and the truly creepy Alvin Karpis, all rated for a variety of capabilities) succeeds he not only pockets the take, but he gains Notoriety. And accumulating Notoriety is what the players are doing to win. Obviously a successful kidnapping (a rare event) will bring loads of Points, but convicting another Bad Guy with your in-house mouthpiece (again, real-life lawyers, from the great trial attorney, Sam Leibowitz to the down-and-dirty Louis Piquett) can also get you some Notoriety.

It is played on a rectangular board made up of two Alquerque boards with 22 plain black and white pieces. Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn, as in checkers. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces. (While very different, the game feels somewhat like Zertz due to the above.)&#10;&#10;Historical note from one game box: Some Fanorona matches were devoted to the Gods and last but not least the fate and colonialization of Madagascar (1895) supposed to be solved unbloody with Fanorona on the game table.&#10;&#10;"

There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The Odin's Ravens (Second Edition) transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Loki deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire.

Chess Race, first released as Schachjagd, is a kind of Pachisi game with three pawns for each color (when played with four) and a set of cards with all chess symbols on it. Take two cards in hand, and use one card for your turn, moving one of your pawns around the racecourse. Any two identical cards can be used like a queen and one obstacle can be moved to attempt to block your opponents.&#10;Schachjagd is also contained in Spiele-Box (Carlit 1980).&#10;&#10;Chess Race is an evolution of Schachjagd as in that game players rolled a die bearing chess symbols on it to determine how one of their pawns could be moved on that turn.&#10;&#10;"

Roll the bat die to see what color bat you have to add on your turn. You may be lucky and have to place a small one or not so lucky and have to place the biggest bat of all. As each player goes, the weight of all those bats begins to tug on the top bat so, be careful! If your bat is the one that makes them fall, you get a Bat Token. When a player has 3 Bat Tokens they're out of the game and the player who has the fewest Bat Tokens at that time wins!&#10;&#10;"

The majority are E/E cards. Only Character cards have colour illustrations, the others being monochrome or text only. A small errata sheet is included.&#10;&#10;Simple &amp; Easy Game&#10;Each player starts with 2 character cards and a Quest card (which determines their starting area on the map), with the character's Cunning &amp; Strength, plus a Talent - an extra rule or exception they can use, tying in to the character in the novels. &#10;Each turn starts by drawing an Event/Encounter card, playing it if it's a Disaster. Other E/E cards include objects to assist in some way, commonly in combat, hazards to play on other players, additional characters (mixed in from those not in play) etc., often limited by area (you have to get to some areas to activate some objects, for instance). &#10;If there is no Disaster, players move their pawn across the board (normally 2 areas, Characters, Event cards &amp; the area characteristics can modify this). The other players may then play Events or Creatures on them, possibly limited by the area. Characters can attempt to avoid encounters (roll dice under Cunning), or may fight (roll a die under Strength to cause a wound, repeat until one side loses). The specific encounter or creature may modify this, as can many E/E cards. &#10;Players start from scratch if their character is beaten, but can heal by use of certain cards or in certain areas. &#10;The first to complete their Quest wins.&#10;&#10;Still Simple &amp; Easy but Longer Game&#10;Same as before, but complete 2 or 3 Quests.

Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.&#10;&#10;By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remco&rsquo;s late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was &ldquo;Spudsie,&rdquo; a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered &ldquo;Chip O&rsquo;Grattin.&rdquo; Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out &ldquo;Yahoo!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;"

4482,,"Winchester is a race game where the players score points by getting their pawns around a rectangular track the fastest. Each player gets 3 to 5 pawns (based on the number of players) which are placed on a 4 by 4 starting grid.  The track is four squares wide. During the setup, the players randomly cover some of these squares with wooden blocks to provide obstacles that prevent movement. The location of the blocks is determined by several die rolls.  This random setup provides for a different track each race.&#10;&#10;Movement of the players' pawns is controlled by a special six sided chess die. The die contains the six basic chess pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn. Each turn a player will roll the chess die to determine everyone's move for that turn.  Once all players have moved, the next player on the left rolls the die for the next round. When moving, the player must move one of his pieces based on the indicated chess piece.  Like chess, the player may not move off the edge of the board or over one of the obstacles, except for the knight move.  If the player captures one of the piece of another player, the two pieces exchange positions.&#10;&#10;The first piece to cross the finish line scores 15 points with each successive piece scoring one less (14, 13, 12, etc).  There are small bonuses for certain finishing conditions (first to have all pieces finish, three positions in a row, etc).&#10;&#10;The game comes with a rolled up, laminated board, 25 pawns, 24 wooden blocks for obstacles, one normal die and one chess die.&#10;&#10;"

4498,,"Memory game with plastic igloos, cardboard Inuit, and a die.&#10;&#10;The first player to hide all of their Inuit in the igloos wins.&#10;&#10;Each player rolls a die and then puts as many igloos on his or her Inuit as the number on the die.  Because the igloos are so small, you can only fit one Inuk in every igloo.  And, of course, there are never enough igloos to go around.  Luckily, you can &quot;steal&quot; already occupied igloos from the other players once your igloos are full.&#10;&#10;If a player rolls a special symbol on the die, they can switch two igloos around -- just to confuse everybody.&#10;&#10;"

4502,,"The inhabitants of the planet ROLLEX in the Sun system SOLLEX used to live on nothing but the delicious fried dice that fell from the sky. They found these so delicious, that they would often spend years at a time, just sitting in their towers, hardly moving at all, enjoying this delicacy.  Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.&#10;&#10;However, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they&rsquo;d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they&rsquo;d got so fat that they couldn&rsquo;t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.&#10;&#10;But just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who&rsquo;d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.&#10;&#10;Soon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.  And they developed a race, held every year, a dice tower race.  And nowadays, every year, the winner of the race is crowned as King of the Dicemouths.&#10;&#10;"
