It uses the traditional card-driven system, adapting it to the specific circumstances of the Spanish Civil War.&#10;&#10;Each player has his own deck of strategic cards, which are the heart of the game, and must make difficult choices on their use through-out the game. Each card has four possible uses, but only one of them can be chosen each time the card is played! The possibilities are:&#10;&#10;Recreate a Historical Event: Each card shows a historical event that affected the course of the war. They include political, military, economic and even social events, as well as the reinforcements that flowed to both sides through-out the war both from within Spain, and from foreign powers Germany, Italy and Russia.&#10;Conduct Operations: Each card has an operations value that is used for activating units on the game map for movement, preparing fortifications, or attacking.&#10;Strategic Redeployment (SR) of Troops: Each card has a Strategic Redeployment value that is used to move units great distances on the game map, or to bring units out of Reserve to shore up a threatened flank.&#10;Replacement Points for Reforming Your Army: Each card has a Replacement Point value which is recorded and used for repairing damaged or rebuilding destroyed units at the end of the turn.&#10;&#10;The greater impact the historical event of a card has on the game, the greater its Operations, SR and Replacements value. As such, a player is often faced with a dilemma while playing each card: use an important event, launch an offensive in a vulnerable zone, move units from one front to other, or accumulate replacements to recover from losses? Combine this with &quot;Combat cards&quot; that bring tactical benefits, and a player faces has a myriad of choices with each and every card.&#10;&#10;A complete C&amp;R game is divided into three phases, which illustrate the evolution of the Spanish Civil War and introduce new strategic cards:&#10;&#10;The War of the Columns phase begins with the outbreak of war and finishes in February 1937. During this phase only &ldquo;small units&rdquo; are used, because both sides had limited combatants, almost all grouped in irregular units - called &ldquo;columns&rdquo;- that operated across large, poorly garrisoned fronts. The best of these &ldquo;small units&rdquo; are the Nationalist African Army regular army units &ndash; brought to the Spanish mainland from Morocco by Franco at the outbreak of the war. These units are strong, but brittle, as they cannot be replaced or replenished with Replacement Points.&#10;&#10;The Mobilization phase lasts from March 1937 to February 1938. During this period the two sides realized that the war would not be over quickly, and began to mobilize their human and material resources to form regular armies. The players deploy their first &ldquo;large units&rdquo; (army corps) and large battles erupt across Spain.&#10;&#10;The War of the Armies phase begins in March 1938 and lasts until the end of the war, in April 1939. During this time, the Nationalists tried to force the enemy&rsquo;s unconditional surrender, while the Republic fought desperately to resist and prolong the Spanish Civil War so that it might merge with the threatening Second World War, which could be seen looming in the horizon.&#10;&#10;Take command of your forces!

Water is scarce and you try to build your Shadoof (a sort of waterpump) as close to the Wadi as possible. A wadi, however, is a desert river. Water flows though it for only a small part of the year. The rest of the time it is dry. In the short wet period, you try to pump as much water as possible to the water reservoirs. Preferably in the vicinity of fertile land, because the more fertile the land, the better the harvest. And the better the harvest, the more points a player earns.&#10;&#10;But... other players might have noticed the same good spot, where you want to build your shadoof. And when you build your shadoof there, they won&rsquo;t help you fill the water reservoirs. But if you hesitate too long, the other players might pump dry the Wadi. Or worse, the water streams down the wadi and the land close to your shadoof remain dry and barren.&#10;&#10;There are a few scenarios for Wadi delivered with the game. They bring a lot of variety.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Players build their shadoofs on the land tiles. Each shadoof can pump water pawns from the river bed or from another land tile that lies in the vicinity of that shadoof (vicinity = water pawn lies on his own tile or on an adjacent tile). In his turn a player can carry out two actions. He can either:&#10;&middot; Build 1 shadoof first and then pump 1 water pawn (or vice versa)&#10;OR&#10;&middot; Pump 2 water pawns.&#10;&#10;Round after round players build shadoofs and/or pump water pawns. At the end of each round, the water that is still in the river bed, flows downstream. This means, that all the water pawns in the river beds are moved downstream 1 river tile.&#10;When the river bed is completely empty, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Players earn points per shadoof. Every landtile surrounding the shadoof (including its own tile) with a water pawn on it brings 1, 2 or 3 points, depending on the fertility of the land. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Players &quot;fight&quot; to get water pawns near their shadoofs and for the places to build their shadoofs. They also try to profit from water pawns that other players pumped on to the land tiles. Because of the placing rules (not explained here) this is not always as easy as it looks.&#10;&#10;All in all Wadi is a quick, tactical game. With 2 players it is a bit more strategic.&#10;&#10;"

For boys and girls Ages 6 - 12&#10;&#10;Rules: &#10;How to Play Trail Drive&#10;&#10;THE GAME: Try to play as many cards as you can each turn to build a long Trail Drive with a Chuckwagon, Cowboys and Cows, laying your cards in a row on the table in front of you. A Rustler might stop you, but a Sheriff gets you started again.&#10;THE DEAL: If four or more play, deal 4 cards apiece, then play that round, deal 4 more and play again, continuing to deal and play until the deck is used up. If three play, deal 5 cards apiece each round. If two play, deal 6.&#10;THE PLAY: After each round is dealt, beginning at left of the dealer you each play what you can from your hand. The first three cards must be 1 Chuckwagon and 2 Cowboys in any order; then you add cows, the more the better. Discard the rest of your hand, face down. After each round the discards are added to the bottom of the deck. You may play a Rustler card to stop anyone&rsquo;s Trail Drive when it has cows. Then no more Cows may be added, until a Sheriff is played on the Rustler. You may start a new Trail Drive, when your first Drive is rustled (with 1 Chuckwagon, 2 Cowboys, then Cows, as before), but you may not play on more than one Trail Drive in one turn. Therefore, you may not play a Sheriff card and start a new Drive in the same turn.&#10;When Deck is used up, whether or not it comes out even, the dealer calls, &ldquo;Last Round.&rdquo; On the last round, each player passes to the next player the cards he can&rsquo;t use, instead of discarding.&#10;THE WINNER: When all possible plays have been made, you each take out all the Rustlers, plus two Cows for each Rustler. Count the rest. Whoever has the most wins.&#10;&#10;"
