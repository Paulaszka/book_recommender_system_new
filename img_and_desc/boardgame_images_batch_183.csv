There two very different dynamics at work in the game. Since you cannot land on a square of another player's color, part of the game focuses on blocking opposition pieces and avoiding being blocked. However the game features a &quot;connection change&quot; move which involves pre-planning so that you can move one of your pieces several squares across to another square already of your color. Potentially this could be right across the board, which is a 9 by 9 grid.&#10;&#10;Each time a piece moves the square it lands on becomes its own color, and the number of colored squares it has in one of the nine 3x3 borderlands on the game board determines the power of movement the piece has.&#10;&#10;If the connection change involves changing a square of opposition color then your piece leaves the game, but this can also be to your advantage since the game ends shortly after the first person playing is in a position where they cannot move any pieces. So players strive to get ahead on squares and then cause any early end to the game ... or wait so that they can make a dramatic connection change on the last turn that follows the first person being unable to move.&#10;&#10;Azacru is one of the games featured in the Pacru Series 302 game box of 2005 (the games all use the same board, pieces/chevrons and markers). Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru &amp; Azacru.&#10;&#10;"

The &quot;checkers&quot; feel to be made of high-quality material, and feel cool and smooth to the touch, reminiscent of 'Go' stones, but much larger (and flat). They have star outline, star-filled, and star-filled in a circle designed etched into them: 1 set blue etchings, 1 set red etchings. The board is standard hard cardboard. The board art is gray background with white lines, with blue and red stars, triangles, and square delineated colored zones.&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 1 'pawn' (checker) and 1 &quot;King' (checker with a star in a circle design} on their designated opposed short-sides of the 9 x 10 square board. Two dice (each numbered only 1-3) are rolled to determine movement.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pawns&quot; (checkers) move forward or sideways and can only jump other &quot;pawns&quot;.&#10;&#10;&quot;Knights' (checkers with a star design) are created by jumping a &quot;pawn&quot; with its own &quot;King&quot;, They can jump &quot;pawns&quot; or &quot;knights&quot;, and may not be jumped by &quot;pawns&quot;. When a &quot;pawn&quot; is knighted, the checker is flipped over to it's star-design side.&#10;&#10;&quot;Kings&quot; (checker with a star in a circle design) move forward, backward, or sideways. They can jump any piece, but must stay out of the opponent's &quot;holding zone&quot; (a 3 x 3 square area in the middle of the opponent's side).&#10;&#10;A piece may enter the board on a player's holding zone when a 2 is rolled on a die, and is moved the number on the other die.&#10;&#10;A piece may leave the board when it is in a &quot;destination square&quot; (located on the last rank of the opponents side of the board) on any roll.&#10;&#10;Captures are only made by a King. When a king jumps an opposing piece, that piece is placed back in the opponent's 'holding zone' (effectively starting over it's journey).&#10;&#10;There is a scoring system in place for end-of game (Pawns with 1, Knights 2, Kings 4), and the doubling-cube is used to issue challenges during play.&#10;&#10;The rule-sheet has a small section on strategies, and &quot;Championship tournament&quot; guidelines. Very ambitious.&#10;&#10;"
