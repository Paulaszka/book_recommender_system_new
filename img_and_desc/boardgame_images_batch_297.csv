Bell as a &quot;square board race game.&quot; The game is played on a 5x5 grid which would have been marked out on the ground. The center space is the castle and the middle squares on each side of the board are serve as a player's palace. Each player uses four small sticks as their pieces. Four tamarind seeds marked with three white sides and three dark sides to function as dice.&#10;&#10;The pieces start off the board.    A &quot;1&quot; must be rolled to move a piece onto the board. The pieces first travel counterclockwise around the outside of the board and then travel through the inner nine squares in a clockwise spiral pattern until they reach the castle square at the center of the board. Once all four of a player's pieces have reached the central castle square, the player begins trying to bear them off the board. For each &quot;1&quot; rolled a player may remove one piece from the castle. The first player to remove all four pieces wins the game.&#10;&#10;When a player moves onto a square containing the piece or pieces of an opposing player, the opponent's pieces are removed from the board and must start the journey again. However, this rule does not apply to the palace and castle spaces, which are safe havens. In addition, under certain circumstances a player may pair together two pieces as a &quot;twin&quot; which permits them to move together and which may only be sent off the board by another &quot;twin&quot; piece.&#10;&#10;A more elaborate form of the game, known as The King's Thayaam, is played on a board double the size and uses eight tamarind seeds as dice instead of four.&#10;&#10;This game is similar to the Indian games Saturankam and Ashta-Kashte.&#10;&#10;"

In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;GAME CHARACTERISTICS&#10;The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck.

It's a standard roll-and-move format, on a large 14x40 inch roll-up board.  All players start at one end of the island.  Four dice (provided) are rolled, and players use the value on a single die or pairs of dice to see if they can equal the mileage to proceed to the next location.  Water routes are sometimes available, and you can use those if you roll trips or a four-straight in three rolls, Yahtzee-fashion.  There are penalties for being landed on.&#10;&#10;The locations are campgrounds, scenic sights, fire lookouts, etc., with each type worth so many points to the player landing there or passing by.  Points are tallied on a provided pad with a provided pencil.  Some sights allowed the drawing of a Fortune Card, which can add or subtract additional points.&#10;&#10;The board is very attractive and informative, and the four pawns with the game are solid copper lathe-turned figures.  I imagine the game-play might be just a notch above the average roll-and-move, due to the complexity of the path network, the varying values of the stops, and the &quot;Can't Stop&quot;-ish dice selection mechanic.&#10;&#10;"
