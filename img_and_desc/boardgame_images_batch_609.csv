At times, action tokens may accumulate in front of a player, allowing them to take multiple actions at once.&#10;&#10;Diner is the winner of the Dice Hate Me Games 54-Card Challenge - a contest that challenged designers to create a game using only 54 cards and very minimal components.

The real magic of the game is in the pseudo-real time action system.&#10;&#10;When you want to take an action - say, seat a table in your section - you have to have an action token in front of you. When you perform the action you pass the token to the player next to you. Sometimes those action tokens can pile up allowing you to do multiple things at once. Other times you&rsquo;re urging the other players to hurry up a bit so you can serve your tables.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a very madcap, social experience, with lots of table talk. With the action tokens, though, it&rsquo;s not total chaos like many real-time games - there is a lot of control worked into the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a brilliant design, and one that will appeal to many gamers whether they like real-time games or not. Guaranteed.&#10;&#10;"

While many approved of the idea of consolidating efforts that had been scattered among at least four small, unfunded departments, not everyone agreed with the whole idea.&#10;&#10;Churchill's directive, &quot;Set Europe Ablaze,&quot; had grand sound to it, but many felt that the diversion of crack military personnel would be a waste -- Churchill's penchant for disastrous side-shows pre-dated Gallipoli -- while others wondered at the relative value and morality of arming civilians... something not recognized by the Geneva Convention. The fact that SOE took some of its ideas from the IRA's efforts in Ireland just emphasizes the shocking reminder that those we see as brave Resistance fighters might be viewed as &quot;terrorists&quot; through a different lens. Having seen how the Germans handled &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; in 1870 and 1914, none would suppose that these Germans would be less ruthless. But, faced with propaganda about the &quot;Thousand Year Reich,&quot; the Allies felt compelled to create a &quot;second front&quot; of some sort, long before Normandy.&#10;&#10;Set Europe Ablaze captures the spirit and complex choices involved in Occupied Western Europe. Award-winning designer John Prados, who last gave us Beyond Waterloo, again focuses on action in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Prados brings us a card-driven game pitting the Occupying Axis forces against the combination of Allied intelligence efforts and brave local citizens, fighting the shadow war that made &quot;the Maquis&quot; a name to remember proudly.&#10;&#10;Unlike many board strategy games, the focus is not on movement and combat by military units but on political-economic strategy. The Axis player wants to extract as much raw materials and finished goods as possible, to aid the war effort, and the Allied player seeks to avert this. Allied tactics include sabotage, interdiction, and intelligence gathering.&#10;&#10;Axis responses include partisan sweeps, counterintelligence operations, and labor pool mobilization to repair damage. Turns abstractly represent about six months each, with rounds within each turn varying according to cards played. While there is no &quot;combat&quot; in a literal sense, there are competitions for resolving actions that have both players rolling dice.

Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko: MAGNACI, presents the history of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from its heyday during the Union of Lublin (XVI century) until the collapse of the state (XVIII century). Players take on the roles of the magnates, who seek to develop the power of their families in the favorable time: the peak of the Polish and Lithuanian Union.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards that depicts celebrities of his family. Some of them are capable of great deeds and some will spoil any project with which they are entrusted &mdash; but with a good player's decisions, even those small souls could do a lot for his family.&#10;&#10;During the game, players manage the deck of their characters to achieve, in competition with others, as much as possible on each of the planes of life of the Republic. The fate of the country results from the sum of the activities of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players fall into a mutual fight for titles and advantages, the Republic will fall under the pressure of neighboring powers.&#10;&#10;This game for 2-5 players with a game time not exceeding 90 minutes reimplements Martin Wallace's Bo&#197;&#188;e Igrzysko from 2010, using the same principal title in Polish edition under an agreement with the author.&#10;&#10;From the back of the game box:&#10;&#10;The MAGNATES: A Game of Power is a strategic board game for 2-5 players which is fast and full of historical atmosphere and rich interactions. It takes you into the world of aristocratic intrigues and struggles for power which tore the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from its heyday during the Union of Lublin, until the Targowica Confederation and the fall of the Polish-Lithuanian state.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of magnates who seek to develop their own family's power in a moment favorable to fortune: the prime of the Union of Poland and Lithuania. The most eminent families fight for prestige and landed estates: the Lubomirski, the Potocki, the Radziwi&#197;&#130;&#197;&#130;, the Sapieha and the Zamoyski.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards depicting well-known personages from a given family.

And so, as it happened in reality, the fate of the country will be the result of the sum of actions of the most powerful aristocratic families. If the players lose themselves in a mutual fight for titles and advantage, the Commonwealth will collapse under the pressure of the neighboring powers.&#10;&#10;In MAGNATES, players will face many dilemmas. The most prominent members of the family will ensure beneficial rights in the Sejm and prestigious positions in the Senate. Moreover, they comply with the Monarch's will easily, and thanks to them the family will gain estates and power. But how will a player handle the remaining challenges? Who will undertake an expedition to Livonia? Will the troops protecting the country against enemy invasion, in the absence of other candidates, be again led by incompetents (like &quot;peryna, latyna and dytyna&rdquo;)? Will there be enough determination to hasten to the relief of Vienna? Will the players succeed in saving the Homeland from partitioning?&#10;&#10;Is your Family ready for a Game of Power?&#10;&#10;"

By the end of the game, each player will have created a unique, custom neighborhood with areas that interact with each other, hoping to outscore the competition by having the best subdivision.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a subdivision player board and a hand of hex-shaped zone tiles. A parcel die is rolled to indicate the type of parcel where a zone tile may be placed, and all players simultaneously place one of their tiles. If a zone tile is placed next to existing zone tiles, those existing tiles have the ability to create new improvements, which may also be placed at this time. Those improvements provide money and points, while slowly covering up as many parcels as possible. Players pass the remaining zone tiles in hand to their left, then someone rolls the parcel die once again. This continues until only one zone tile remains in hand, which is discarded.&#10;&#10;Players then play another round, but at the start of the second, third, and fourth rounds, players first check to see whether they've achieved bonuses, which give them extra cash or allow for extra activations of certain zone tiles.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends, and scores are tallied, with players gaining points for parks being adjacent to other tiles, sidewalks passing through as many different zones and improvements as possible, schools ranking the best in the city, and zones connecting to the highway that runs around (or through) your subdivision.&#10;&#10;"

Reach, spin and swap pieces of cheese to cover all the tasty toppings!&#10;&#10;Each slice of bread contains a different combination of condiments -- peanut butter and jelly, pickles and ketchup, mustard and olives. Cover the toppings with the cheese slices so none of the fixins' can be seen through the holes of the cheese.&#10;&#10;The player who finds the correct combo of bread and cheese first wins the card. But who will cover all their fixins' first? Combine speed and visual thinking skills and you'll be the BIG cheese!&#10;&#10;"
