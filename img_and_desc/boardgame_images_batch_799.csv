Each Mission is divided in several stages, each with a unique goal. At key points the player gets to choose where to go next. The most important thing for a Blight Agent is to be invisible so be sure to keep the Suspicion to a minimum. Full exposure means instant failure.&#10;&#10;The Agent starts the game with the same deck, but as you face different obstacles your move set will change, and so will your gear. When dealing with an obstacle you&rsquo;re faced with a choice: Do you knock it out without making too much noise, or eliminate it and take its gear?&#10;&#10;Choose your stages well! Each has a different set of obstacles and goal, affected by choices you made in previous stages. They also allow you to collect different gear.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s your chance to show Blight and the World that you&rsquo;re worthy, ready to face everything on your path.

In this card game you must compete to capture the angelic and the diabolical a like.&#10;&#10;The cards feature gothic art of angels and daemons from holy lore as voted for by the backers. This theme is replicated in the special rules which sees each Angel matched with an opposing Demon.  You as a Ghost Hunter must choose which to specialize in capturing, for the best bonuses in your final score.&#10;&#10;Ghost Hunter: Angels &amp; Demons is a card game for 2 &ndash; 6 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.&#10;&#10;It is a standalone game but can be combined with the other Ghost Hunter decks for variation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

In addition, some cards have special powers that may be activated during resolution.  In the case of &quot;ties&quot;, resolution may require succeeding card plays.  Players who have all their sword cards eliminated are themselves eliminated from the game.

Each player has their own board and on their turn they pick up all the pieces in a space and drop them one-per-space (in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction) and have an opportunity to score when the pieces in the last space match the icons on one of the cards each player gets.

You will need the cards and player boards to play. Chips, meeples, or cubes can be used for the pieces. A recommended color chart for each icon type is included.

Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay. But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm. The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape.&#10;&#10;In Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep. Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded. No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits. Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda? The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Even without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit. To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm. To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them. Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes. You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit.&#10;&#10;While you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features. Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable. You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one. Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit. While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it. Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own.&#10;&#10;On top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea. Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm. When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters. Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone. The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces. If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared. If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;While lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own. For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track. Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks. It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

In the center are 3 sets of a row of 9 spaces, one each to be shared between each possible pair of players. That shared row acts as a fifth row of a board shared by a given pair of players; only those two given players may nter or cross through the space. As usual orientation of a piece marks ownership. All standard rules of shogi apply.&#10;&#10;For a 3 player version, one player's partial board is simply eliminated.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is clockwise. To use Western terminology, a player whose &quot;king&quot; is checkmated at the start of their turn-- whether by a single player-s pieces or by a combination of players' pieces-- is eliminated. The &quot;king&quot; is removed from the board&quot; and thereafter that player's turn is skipped. The last remaining player wins.&#10;&#10;"

In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (&quot;hole cards&quot;), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the &quot;board&quot;, and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.&#10;&#10;Also known as &quot;flop poker&quot;, community card poker is a variation of stud poker. Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. Texas hold 'em and Omaha are two well-known variants of the community card family.&#10;&#10;Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&#10;&#10;"
