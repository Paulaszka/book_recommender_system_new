Want to Create a Dark Underground Fortress and fill it with Wicked Minions? Want to Create an Evil Empire, bringing Chaos, Death and Destruction? Want to Bash pitiful, useless Heroes? Welcome to the Unofficial Dungeon Keeper Card Game.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You've got lands (Rooms). You've got Creatures. You've got 20 LifePoints. Just like in magic. Different Rooms are needed to Summon more Creatures, or to research Spells or to build Artifacts, and in general to be more Powerful.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But there's come the fun part. Creatures can't be anywhere: they must be In a Room. To represent this, you need to put your Creatures near the Rooms they're in. A creature in a Room can defend it, but cannot defend a different Room . . . So be wary not to expand your Dungeon too much, or you will be unable to defend it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A Creature in a Room can also use the Room. So, for example, your Warlock in your Library will be able to research a Spell (or to defend the Library). If you want him to defend the Lair, instead, you can move him in the Lair (in the appropriate Turn Phase), but then he will be unable to research a Spell (as he need to be in the Library to do so).&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You can win in two ways: 1) Kill the Avatar when he's attacking your Dungeon (The World Will Be Mine! Victory), 2) Kill the other Dark Lord (BWHAHA ! Victory).&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Players who made their bid exactly, score 10 points plus a bonus of the number of tricks taken squared.  See variants for non-exponential scoring systems to reduce the likelihood of a runaway leader.&#10;&#10;One appeal of Israeli Whist is that the ability to judge a hand's strength is more important than relying on luck to get a good hand.

This gives every pilot the information they need to know where each object will most likely move to (the value rolled for each dice determines which direction the object moves in) using the hex based board.&#10;&#10;The trick is that some objects move a differing number of spaces and objects react differently when collisions occur, thus a player's best laid plans may not pan out due to mistakes.&#10;&#10;Mistakes introduces the other unique aspect of Asteroyds. The players only get a given amount of time to work out their best flight path and then plan their moves on their planning board. A minute is recommended and 30 seconds for experts. This real-time tension in the planning is tense and helps the game to stick to a good play length.&#10;&#10;Asteroyds also offers advanced rules such as shooting, special pilot powers and also varied play modes such as; Shooting, Targets and drones. Some of these allow for team play.&#10;&#10;"

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!&#10;&#10;"

In both the play and the game, Cyrano writes poetry to woo a woman for another man. The game Cyrano lasts a number of rounds, and each round starts with a player revealing a theme card and two rhyme cards (&quot;-aid&quot;, &quot;-ed&quot; and so on with homonyms being acceptable). Each player then composes a quatrain (a poem of four lines) with two of the lines ending with one of the rhymes and the other two ending with the other rhyme. Players read their poems and score points Boggle-style, with each unique ending word being worth one point; these points are recorded by blacking out squares on a ladder, which represents the lover&rsquo;s climb toward his object of affection.&#10;&#10;Everyone then secretly votes on which poem he or she most appreciated, whether for its beauty, adherence to theme, or some other artistic qualification. Players reveal their votes simultaneously, and for each player who voted the same way you did, you receive one point, with these points being recorded by the maiden&rsquo;s descent from the tower. Whichever player first brings the loves onto the same floor of the tower wins, with ties being broken by a rhyming duel.&#10;&#10;"

There are two sets of cards; large cards that show full drawings, and smaller cards that show individual parts of the full drawings. Each full drawing on a large card consists of three main parts. Therefor there are three small cards for each large card.&#10;&#10;Both sets of cards are put face down on the playing area. You can choose to mix the large and small cards together in one group, or to have them as two separate groups.&#10;&#10;In a turn a player first flips over one of the large cards which will show a full drawing. For example: A bird in a nest on a branch. Then the player flips over a small card, trying to match it with the full drawing on the large card that's already flipped over. In the example mentioned, a matching small card should show a drawing of either the bird, the nest or the branch.&#10;&#10;If no match is made, both the large and small cards are to be flipped over again, face down. If a match is made, the player gets to keep only the small card; the large card has to be flipped over again. However, if the matching small card is the last of the small cards remaining for the specific large card, then the player gets to keep both cards.&#10;&#10;A player is allowed another turn whenever he/she is able to collect a small tile. If a player collects both a large and a small card, it's the next players' turn.&#10;&#10;Should a player overlook the fact that the collected small card was the last one of the set remaining, and flip over the large card so that it is facing down again instead of collecting it, then any player in his/her own turn can still collect this large card. A player doing so has to mention that the large card he/she collects does not have any of its small cards remaining. Collecting a single large card also means that it's the next players' turn.&#10;A player that overlooks to collect a large card does however get another turn since he/she did collect a small card. He/she can still use this extra turn to collect the large card, so other players are warned not to rejoice openly to quickly as this might trigger him/her to do just that!&#10;&#10;If a player collects a large card, the remaining large cards have to be shuffled.&#10;Whenever a single player manages to collect a full set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards), all remaining cards (large and small) have to be shuffled.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more cards to be collected. To determine the winner, the cards are counted and scored as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 point for each small card&#10;     2 points for each large card (except for the last collected large card; No points for that!)&#10;     3 bonus points for each complete set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards)&#10;&#10;&#10;The player that gets the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
