As well as opponents, keep a look out for the oncoming drone drivers and oil spills as you select high gear in your bid to win the Championship!&#10;&#10;Grid Position uses a unique gameplay mechanic where the cars advance along the track comprised of a 4x5 grid by moving the drone and crashed cars backwards!&#10;&#10;Each player moves their car one space either forward, back, left or right in turn order that is decided by a dice roll.  Each car has a corresponding coloured dice that are all rolled at once with the highest roll getting the first movement down to the lowest roll moving their car last. Cars also have a Low and a High gear with a forward move only allowed while in High gear and a back move lower your gear to Low.&#10;&#10;After each car has moved all drone cars and any oil spills are moved one space backwards to give the illusion of the race cars moving forward along the track. The Black Race die thrown with the coloured dice adds these drone cars and oil spills when it rolls a 1,2,3 or 4(must match with a coloured die) with a 5 or 6 completing a Lap.&#10;&#10;Players win the race by being at the front of the pack when Lap 7 is completed with a tie being decided with a Photo Finnish roll off between the tied cars. Winners receive a Trophy card for the race with seven trophies available through a Championship season. Player with the most trophies after seven races is crowned the Champion.&#10;&#10;"

It was just named &quot;Best of 2015&quot; by Toys Bulletin as one of the &quot;Best games you have never heard of&quot; in a &quot;100% Independent Review&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game contents include 360 Scout markers (one set of 72 for each player in 5 different colors) 21 Caprocks, 5 Captain player pieces used to move each player around the perimeter of the board, 2 &ndash; twelve sided multi-colored dice, a game board that measures approximately 19&Prime; x 20&Prime; and a nicely illustrated set of rules.&#10;&#10;To play the game, players alternate turns by rolling one die and moving their captain from the space occupied on the perimeter of the game board to the matching color on the perimeter as shown on the die. Once there, there are several options open to the player, depending on the types of figures outlined on the space landed on. If there are one or more hexagons outlined in black, the player can place that many Scouts in the colored zone that matches his die roll. If there is a &quot;half-hexagon&quot; mark on the space, the player can replace any one of the Caprocks, positioned in the colored zone matching the die roll, with one of his/her Scouts.&#10;&#10;An optional move that can be made on a player&rsquo;s turn is a challenge, and this can only be done if the space is marked for a challenge, either a regular challenge or a wild challenge. When a player performs a challenge, he chooses another player&rsquo;s Scout which is adjacent to his own Scout in the colored zone that matches his die roll, or in the case of a wild challenge, he may opt to choose an adjacent player&rsquo;s scout in any zone or even one that is in an adjacent colored zone, which greatly expands his choices. But the challenge must originate from the zone color that matches the die roll. To complete a challenge, each player rolls one 12 sided die, and the winner is determined based on a colorwheel that is conveniently located both on the game board and inside a player&rsquo;s storage box. The colors are arranged in a circular pie-chart manner, and the colors, starting at the top of the circle, beat the colors as they are displayed clockwise around the circle, much like the hands of a clock. In other words, the color located at 12 beats the color at 1, and the color at 7 beats the color at 6. The challenge winner replaces the losing Scout with one of his own. Challenges can continue as long as the player who initiated the challenge continues to win.&#10;&#10;The last and most exciting part of a player&rsquo;s turn involves a closer look at those C-Traps. There is bit more here than first meets the eye. If at any time during a turn, that player&rsquo;s Scouts form a C shape by surrounding any competing Scouts, regardless of color, all Scouts caught within the C-Trap are replaced by Scouts of the player controlling the C-Trap. In order to complete a C-Trap, there must be a minimum of 4 Scouts to surround 1 competitor Scout. But, as the game progresses, careful placement of Scouts can create gigantic C-Traps and suddenly change the entire face of the game board. Players can easily lose 10 or more Scouts on a single turn. The game ends when all of the hexagons in all of the colored zones are covered by Scouts or Caprocks. The player who controls the most zones out of the 12 colors is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

On the back of the game-map sheets were shown the assembly diagrams for the parts contained in the package and the game rules, in four languages, with numerous illustrations for clarification. The main fight rules were checkers/chess like: the pieces must enter the enemy squares to eliminate them, with some hierarchical precedencies: e.g. no foot soldiers could eliminate horse-mounted ones.

Captain Fetterman had often boosted of being able to destroy the Sioux with only hundred men. On occasion of the first sally of his cavalry division in defense of the attacked soldiers he disobeyed Colonel Carrington's order, who, as commandant of the fort, had prohibited from pursuing the Indians. He gave assault, but the Indians let the soldiers pursue them into a gorge where Fetterman and his men were received by about a thousand warriors who killed them all.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;HOW TO START THE GAME&#10;One of the two players keeps the American Army and the other keeps the&#10;Indians. The U.S. Army move first, but initially the soldiers are placed outside the west side of the playing map. The Indians player goes second, but start with his pieces already on the squares on the east border of the map.&#10;HOW TO MOVE&#10;A) On each square the players may place from 1 to a max. of 4 soldiers.&#10;B) Each piece may be moved l square at a time.&#10;C) Each piece may move in a straight line only, never diagonally.&#10;D) Each turn each player can move only the pieces that start the turn on the same square: i.e., at each turn can be moved only the pieces of 1 square (one or more of them).&#10;E) Foot soldiers only (i.e.: no vehicles or horses) may enter the squares where there are houses.&#10;HOW TO ELIMINATE THE ENEMY&#10;A) In order to eliminate the enemy pieces it is necessary to enter the square where they stand.&#10;B) Foot soldiers con eliminate only other foot soldiers (no horse mounted ones).&#10;C) All the enemy pieces in a square are eliminated by entering it.&#10;WHO WINS THE BATTLE&#10;The player who succeeds in eliminating all opposing forces is the winner of the battle.&#10;&#10;"

The colored symbol dice are thrown into the dice tower, showing new challenges every turn. The various symbols and colors have to be sorted. Which is the largest set? Skill is necessary when flicking the pieces. The more dice match the target space, the further the Knight can move.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The active player throws the six dice and a small wooden cube into the dice tower. The player then flicks a wooden disk. If he hits one of the target spaces, he claims the dice that show the matching result (color or symbol). Then the other players in turn order also flick the disk to try to claim some of the remaining dice. After this, the next player becomes the active player, and continues with throwing all dice into the tower.&#10;&#10;Each die collected moves the player's knight one step forward. The first knight reaching to other side of the tower wins.&#10;&#10;There are also rules for a variant in which the players bet which symbol they will roll, get points for matching symbols, and are able to change their bet by paying dice.&#10;&#10;"

A plague whose origin is not widely known wiped out most of the population. Attempts to isolate and purge the cause resulted in wide spread use of major nuclear arsenals and other weapons of mass destruction. Not much was left. Very few people were left. Those that survived found that they had undergone changes.&#10;&#10;The technology in the cars is 20 to 40 years past the &quot;weld on a gun, add some steel plate and go get stuck in&quot; that immediately followed the plague and attempted purges. Vehicles are purpose built for their combat role and are far more deadly. Driver protection is at a premium so motorcycles have mostly been relegated to the few remaining fringe gangs. The mortality rate for motorcycle users is so high they are now called &quot;coffins&quot;.&#10;&#10;The goal is to survive the game and take out as many opponents' cars as possible. Game play is very fast with each turn lasting 3 to 10 minutes depending on how many cars are on the board. Each player uses a control board for each car that tracks turn speed, two phases of movement, component damage, and driver skill use (offense or defense). For the convention play version of the game these control boards are made of wood. For the mass production version (digital image in gallery), the control boards will be on silk screen impregnated boards (~5mm thick). Players track their car status and maneuvers by placing colored pegs on the control board.&#10;&#10;Combat is via opposed dice roles. The attacker gets a pool of dice based on the weapon being shot and the range, speed and direction the target is moving. Driver skill can also add to the attack dice pool. The defender gets defense dice equal to their remaining armor rating and can get additional dice for range, speed and driver skill. Once rolled, any offensive successes over defense score damage. Critical damage is a big part of the game. Any time an attack rolls any successes their is a crit chance. It is extremely unlikely an undamaged car will take a critical hit but a medium to heavily damage car is highly likely to take a critical. The bad news with critical damage is the attacker assigns the damage location. Basically, the attacker hits what his/her driver was aiming for. Critical hits are to be feared and avoided!&#10;&#10;Rules can be played at the Quick Play level, standard level or with all optional rules. The largest change between levels is how to handle collisions. Many diagrams are included in the rules to simplify the learning process and reduce the &quot;rules lawyering&quot; that may occur when questions arise.&#10;&#10;Each game is played via individual scenario or players can play the long term campaign where they control an entire tribe including all their cars as well as drivers and advanced facilities. As drivers score damage, score critical damage, make kills and win scenarios they gain points that allow them to increase in driver skill or obtain upgrades for their cars. The core version of battle roads miniatures includes basic upgrades for the base cars like a bigger engine, bigger weapons, etc. A later expansion will include full design and upgrades of the cars.&#10;&#10;"

But this is actually a good thing, because they are put on the home spaces of their color. Throwing out is mandatory. If a Player forgets to throw another meeple out, one of the meeples in his home is put back to a starting space.

NO! &#10;Forget about expensive game systems, emulators, disconnected online games, and high-priced yearly roster updates. TECHNO BOWL takes everything you love about arcade and video game football classics like Tecmo Bowl, NFL Blitz, and Madden and puts it all on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;1UP&#10;And as if that isn&rsquo;t cool enough, it also gives you a feature that gamers have long asked for but never gotten&hellip; until now! What is it you ask? As a coach in TECHNO BOWL, you will design your own formations and plays. That&rsquo;s right. Let me say it again. You get to design your own formations and plays.&#10;&#10;And I&rsquo;m not talking about choosing several formation cards, lining up elements on a chart, or utilizing some other abstraction. This is putting the power to effortlessly create real football formations and plays into your hands.&#10;&#10;ZERO DOWN TIME&#10;Thanks to the BOX SPORTS ENGINE, there is almost zero down time in the game [except for half time and timeouts of course!]. Coaches are constantly involved, and the on-field players are always interacting with one another as skill checks and ever evolving plays result in: free actions, reactions, read-and-reacts, and offensive and defensive adjustments. Add to that real world timers for setting up formations and selecting plays, and you have a truly dynamic fast-paced tabletop football experience.&#10;&#10;UNPARALLELED FOOTBALL GAMEPLAY&#10;TECHNO BOWL delivers that authentic football feel like no game before it. Establish the running game by punching it in between the tackles or tossing it to a back for an outside sweep. Launch an air offensive while sitting in the pocket or throwing on the run with laser accurate throws directly to the receiver or exciting route passes where you lead the receiver in hopes of beating the coverage. Defense can run man, zone, and mixed defensive packages and bring the blitz. Oh, can it bring the blitz!&#10;&#10;No matter which strategy you choose, the gameplay will look, feel, and flow like a real football play.&#10;&#10;OPTIONS&#10;TECHNO BOWL is all about options, and there&rsquo;s a game mode, team, and play style for everyone. You even have the option to run an option!&#10;&#10;MODES&#10;There are five different modes of play. Each of these brings a different experience to the table.&#10;&#10;- TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with no skills and no field goals.&#10;- ALL TECHNO is 7-vs-7 with skills but no field goals.&#10;- INFERNO! It&rsquo;s ALL TECHNO with more awesome and fire! [more later]&#10;- PRO is 8-vs-8 with no skills but includes field goal rules.&#10;- ALL PRO is 8-vs-8 with skills and field goal rules.&#10;&#10;Each of these modes offers a completely different game experience, and I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. How does adding an extra couple of players to the field [and the ability to kick field goals] equate with an entirely different mode? Trust me. Having that extra player on both sides of the ball quite literally changes everything.&#10;&#10;MAD SKILLS&#10;When playing in modes that utilize special skills and abilities, coaches will have access to three types of players:&#10;&#10;- IMPACT&#10;- STAR&#10;- SUPERSTAR&#10;&#10;These players will come equipped with one or more of the 26 skills found in the game. That count of 26 skills doesn&rsquo;t even include core fundamentals or INFERNO MODE specific skills.&#10;&#10;SKILL&#10;Speaking of skills, TECHNO BOWL is a game of skill and not a random &lsquo;dice fest&rsquo;. The 2d6 rolls used for skill checks mean that coaches won&rsquo;t fall prey to straight-line probabilities or random chaos. Winning is about getting the right match and modifiers to deliver a high percentage roll, having a plan when you get an unusually poor result, and knowing the right time to make a high risk roll for a shot at a very high payoff. Of course, your formations, play calling, and player positioning create these opportunities.&#10;&#10;PLAYMAKER DIE&#10;The PLAYMAKER die powers some of the special skills in the game like stiff arms and spin moves allowing for sophisticated passive abilities to be triggered without the need for complex rules.&#10;&#10;TEAMS&#10;There are 32 teams in the MORE FUN LEAGUE [MFL], and each of these has its own unique play style. This means that you&rsquo;re not just trying to get into the head of the coach that&rsquo;s sitting across the table from you, but that you have to take into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of the players on the specific rosters that you and your opponent are using.&#10;&#10;PLAYER SKILL RATINGS&#10;The player skill rating system ensures that coaches and spectators will know how well or poorly a player performs fundamental actions by simply looking at the jersey number! No need to look at charts or extended stat lines. The league skill cap manages team composition so that you are never taxed to remember an insane number of special abilities or which players have them. Coaches get beaten by other coaches and NOT the rules.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the More Fun League!&#10;&#10;"

Opposing pieces can only be captured once they have moved onto their color spaces.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two players, four players in partnerships, or four players individually. When playing with four the pieces are turned over to show numbers; pieces must end up on the spaces with matching numbers.

Here's an example: &ldquo;Al Capone's vault was opened on live TV by (Barbara Walters/Geraldo Rivera) and there was virtually nothing of value in it.&rdquo; Players then decide if the given answer was correct. For instance, the active player includes &ldquo;Barbara Walters&rdquo; in their statement. If a player thinks that's right, they put the voting chip in their hand. If a player thinks that&rsquo;s incorrect, they put nothing in their hand and have an empty hand. All players then reveal what's in their hand. The correct answer is &ldquo;Geraldo Rivera,&rdquo; so those players with empty hands receive one point&mdash;in the form of a nut&mdash;to put into their score cup. After three rounds of each player having had a turn to read a card, the player with the most nuts wins.&#10;&#10;"

See further details of the developmental history at the designer&#039;s homepage.&#10;&#10;The game board for Star is a hexagon with uneven side lengths made up of hexagonal spaces (e.g. alternating edge length of 6 and 7 hexes). On the board, the playing area is surrounded by a ring of &quot;partial edge hexagons&quot; used for final scoring. The two players (black and white) takes turns to place one stone (in their color) on any un-occupied hex space in the playing area. The goal of the game is to create &quot;stars&quot; - groups of connected stones belonging to one player that touches at least three partial edge hexagons. Each star has a score of the number of partial edge hexagons it touches minus two. The final score of a player is the sum of points for all the stars of that players color.

It was first published in 1983 in Games magazine. It is a connection game, related to games such as Hex, Y, Havannah, and TwixT. Unlike these games, however, the result is based on a player having a higher final score rather than achieving a specific goal. He has since developed a slightly more complicated version called *Star with better balance between edge and center moves, writing &quot;*Star is what those other games wanted to be.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

At the beginning of their next turn, this card is revealed and its research ability is activated. Then the card should be discarded.
