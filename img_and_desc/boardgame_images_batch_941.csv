But his adviser, who dreams of heading the cartel, constantly arranges pretenders all sorts of tricks, trying to show that they are all only &quot;green&quot; Mexicans, and do not deserve to take the place of the Don.&#10;&#10;The set includes cards of two types &mdash; 45 orders of the Don (performed by the player), 45 insidious interference of the Advisor (the player transfers their performance to any other player) and the rules of the game.&#10;&#10;What if it is impossible to execute two (three) Advisor card tips simultaneously? Hence, you are unlucky and the chances of becoming a &quot;green Mexican&quot; have increased significantly :) For example, if one card says that the left hand should be held at the back of the head, and the other that the left hand should cover the knee, then one must break at least one of the cards of insidious advice.&#10;&#10;What if the player can not fulfill the order of Don described in the card? What can not mean?! He does not want to disappoint Don? :) You need to try until it works out. But if, nevertheless, the task is not fulfilled, then such a card goes into a dump, turn the card upside down.&#10;&#10;A pause is possible? What pauses? The struggle for the cartel's empire is in full swing! Ordering alcohol, chewing a fragrant shish kebab or answering the phone call, the player is obliged to fulfill all orders of the Don assigned to him or cards with tips of the adviser.&#10;&#10;The most enterprising and attentive will win, but everyone will get pleasure and positive emotions!&#10;&#10;"

The board game &quot;Conflict Cards&quot; has an age limit of 18+!&#10;&#10;Cards of &#208;&#161;onflict (2 Edition) are a very controversial, if not &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; game.

In the first round, 1 player is selected - &quot;Card Bro&quot; of this round. &quot;Card bro&quot; takes 1 black card from the deck (black cards lie in one deck with the inscription down) and read out the text loudly. Each of the participants (except for &quot;Card bro&quot;) chooses one of his white cards that seems to him the most suitable.&#10;&#10;White cards are transferred to Card Bro, which in turn reads each option separately. We recommend that you reread the black card completely before reading out a new white card. &quot;Card bro&quot; is chosen by the winner, in his opinion, the option. The player whose white card wins this round receives a black card as a &ldquo;ball.&quot;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player draws a new white card from the deck, so that at the beginning of the next round everyone has 10 white cards. White cards used in this round can be put down the white deck so that after a while they will return to them again. In each subsequent round, a new Card Bro is selected so that each player receives this role in turn. You yourself can choose the principle of changing &ldquo;bro&rdquo;: clockwise / counterclockwise, by height, age, leg size, or another sign that is understandable to all participants.&#10;&#10;There are black cards in the deck, labeled &ldquo;take 2&rdquo;. In this case, each player must choose 2 white cards to form a winning combination. It is important to read the white cards in the correct order. Therefore, the card, the text of which you want to read first, you always need to put under the second card and so transmit &quot;bro.&quot;&#10;&#10;If you wish, you can modify the rules, for example, play without a &ldquo;Card Bro&rdquo;. In this case, each player votes for the option that he liked and gets the most votes with the score.&#10;&#10;"

Each player will first total up the number of each type of the elemental insignias on all the world tiles he/she has captured at game end. When the elemental insignia matches the elemental type of the player&rsquo;s Oink, it scores 2 victory points, otherwise each elemental insignia scores 1 victory point for the player. If there is a tie, the player with more occupied world tiles, followed by the number of LIFE tokens in play (on the grid) wins. If there is a further tie, the players may rejoice in their joint victory.&#10;&#10;Ending Condition&#10;&#10;The game will end immediately when one of the following happens:&#10;&#10;1.    A Cosmic Alignment is achieved.&#10;2.    All world tiles in the playing grid are fully occupied (with LIFE tokens and/or Oinks).&#10;3.    A player has captured 5 world tiles.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;Players are randomly assigned one of the four elements before taking turns to draw 3 world tiles at one time from a stack of shuffled world tiles to place one of them down towards forming a 4 x 4 layout of 16 tiles with the grid sides facing up. The leftover world tiles not placed are reshuffled to form a new world tile stack ready for the game. The schematic below labels each world tile from A to P to facilitate the explanation. Each player takes 13 Oinks and 33 LIFE tokens representing his/her assigned element as his/her personal supply.&#10;&#10;A    B    C    D&#10;E    F    G    H&#10;I    J    K    L&#10;M    N    O    P&#10;&#10;Within each World Tile (Grid Side)&#10;&#10;Within each world tile, we will see that the space is further divided into positions in a 4 X 4 grid and they are labeled from 1 to 16 as seen by the schematic below:&#10;&#10;1    2    3    4&#10;5    6    7    8&#10;9    10    11    12&#10;13    14    15    16&#10;&#10;Game Flow&#10;&#10;The youngest player starts first in clockwise order. The first player may place one of his/her LIFE tokens from his/her personal supply in any of the 16 spaces from any of the 16 world tiles.&#10;&#10;Let us assume that it is placed on the world tile A, position 12. The next player can then only place his/her LIFE token in a world tile which is macroscopically aligned to the position of this last placement in the bigger grid. In this case, it will be world tile L.&#10;&#10;This player decides to place it at position 2 in world tile L, which means the following player will have to place his/her LIFE token in world tile B (which is aligned macroscopically to position 2 in any world tile.).&#10;&#10;A player must put down one of his/her LIFE tokens if there is space in the world tile directed by the previous player. If he/she is directed to an unoccupied world but all the spaces within are taken up, he/she may put her LIFE token on any unoccupied space in any world tile.&#10;&#10;When a player runs out of LIFE tokens to be put down on a directed world tile, he/she must take one of his/her own played LIFE tokens from the rest of the world tiles to carry out this action. LIFE tokens already placed on the directed world tile cannot be chosen for this purpose.&#10;&#10;Whenever an alignment of 3 LIFE tokens of any player is linearly placed across the grid within a world tile in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal manner; or all spaces in a world tile are occupied with LIFE tokens and a player holds the majority (in the event of a tie in majority, the player that forms the majority later wins), that player must return all LIFE tokens on it to all players and chooses one of these 2 actions:&#10;&#10;1.    Flips the world tile over and places one of his/her Oinks on it to occupy it. This world tile is considered occupied. In a subsequent move, if any player is directed to occupied tiles like this one, he/she may choose to place his/her LIFE token on any world tile.&#10;&#10;2.    Takes the world tile into his/her personal supply for victory point purposes and replaces this world tile with another from the world tile stack with the grid side facing up. This world tile is considered captured.&#10;&#10;If a player decides that the state of a world tile is occupied rather than captured, it will remain so till the end of the game and vice versa. These two states are not inter-changeable once decided during the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues with the last placement directing the next player to the next world tile till the ending condition is met.&#10;&#10;"

There also are two straight tracks the cross the board at right angles. These are possible shortcuts.&#10;&#10;Players roll dice and move one of their three planes forward by the number shown. If a plane lands on Mount Fuji, it can take the shortcut across to Mount Everest, which takes only 8 spaces instead of 22. If a plane on the shortcut lands on the North Pole, the central space, it can turn toward Berlin and reach the finish line in only five spaces. A second shortcut is possible by landing on the Airship space, directly across from the finish line. This allows the plane to skip the second half of the circle. The first player to get all three players to the finish line wins.&#10;&#10;While the theme is about pleasure travel, competition is cutthroat. Any plane landing on the same space as another one &quot;shoots down&quot; the first plane, sending it back to start.&#10;&#10;The rules are printed on the back of the board and appear in Japanese, English and Spanish.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

It is now time to undertake a journey to retrieve them. Will you be able to do it before anyone else?&#10;&#10;RULE BOOK&#10;&#10;Components&#10;- 1 Ancient Egypt board game&#10;- 150 coloured pyramids (30 each in Red, Blue, Yellow,&#10;Green, Black)&#10;- 186 Illustrated cards:&#10;              - 110 movement cards (24 for each symbol: Light, Dark,&#10;                 Nature and Water + 14 &quot;Eye of Horus&quot;)&#10;              - 36 Gods Cards&#10;              - 40 Event cards&#10;- 1 bag for hieroglyphics&#10;- 300 hieroglyphs&#10;- 75 beetle tokens (15 for each player)&#10;- 5 Player scrolls&#10;- 5 hieroglyphics holders (1 for each player)&#10;- 5 pawns (1 for each player)&#10;- 5 scorekeepers (1 for each player)&#10;- 1 rule book.&#10;&#10;PREPARATION OF THE GAME&#10;Place the board in the middle of the table.&#10;Each player chooses a color. Each player is given 30 Pyramids, 1 pawn, 1 scorekeepers of the chosen colour, 1 player scroll, 15 scarab tokens and 1 hieroglyphic holder.&#10;Each player places his marker token on the Start square of the marker, and places his pawn on the Pyramid of Hours square; it will be the starting square for all players. &#10;Before you start the game, distribute it to each player: &#10;- 4 movement cards&#10;- 3 Gods cards&#10;- 10 hieroglyphs &#10;Now place the Movement card deck, the Gods card deck, the Event card deck and the hieroglyphics bag next to the board. &#10;You are now ready to begin.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME&#10;The aim of the game is to get the highest number of points. You earn points when you reach on the board the pyramid corresponding to the God card in your hand and you have previously formed the name of the corresponding God with hieroglyphics. (Example: the God Card HORUS is formed by the hieroglyphics corresponding to the letters H , O, R, U, and S. If you reach the &quot;Pyramid of Horus&quot; box on the board and you have the necessary hieroglyphics [see the conversion of letters into hieroglyphics on your player's scroll], you will have conquered the HORUS Card and you will be able to advance on the scoreboards with the value of the Card: in this case Horus is formed by 6 letters and therefore worth 6 points. &#10;&#10;&#10;TURN OF GAME &#10;The older player starts first. The game then proceeds clockwise. Each player in his turn can make 1 of these moves (only one):&#10;&#10;- draw 2 movement cards;&#10;&#10;- move on the map - The player can move on the board using the movement cards. Each movement card corresponds to the 4 colors on the map and the player must use the exact color and quantity indicated on the boxes to move on the board. (Example: the pyramid of Horus and Anubis are connected by 4 blue &quot;water&quot; squares + 2 yellow &quot;light&quot; squares; then the player must play 4 water movement cards + 2 light movement cards, for a total of 6 cards).&#10;           - If the player reaches the pyramid of the God card in his possession and has previously formed his name with hieroglyphics, he can put his coloured pyramid on top of the pyramid square. He then moves the scorekeepers along the number-marker corresponding to the value of the card, places a scarab token on his player's scroll. Finally, he discards the newly conquered God Card and can draw a new one. The hieroglyphs he used to form the name must be discarded, and the player may draw the hieroglyphs from the bag of the same number as the newly discarded ones. &#10;          - If the player reaches any pyramid on the map without having the right to        conquer it, nothing happens and his turn ends.&#10;         - If the player reaches the Event square, draw 1 Event card.&#10;&#10;- Draw 1 hieroglyph from the bag, but first he must pay by placing an uncovered hieroglyph in front of the bag. (or the player can choose 1 hieroglyph from those already uncovered, always paying with his own hieroglyph).&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;When the Gods card deck is finished and one of the players wins his last God card, the final round begins for all players (except for the same player who has already finished the game).&#10;After the final round, the game ends and the players move on to calculating their final score.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;Players should have already marked on the scoreboard the points earned by winning each God card. Each player must then add 5 points for each scarab token they have previously deposited on their personal scroll. &#10;In addition, the player who has conquered more than 2 or more &quot;sons of Horus&quot; has bonus points:&#10;2 sons of Horus: 5 bonus points&#10;3 sons of Horus: 8 bonus points&#10;All 4 sons of Horus: 10 bonus points&#10;The player with the most points wins the game. If two or more players have the same number of points, the player who has won the most sons of Horus wins the game. In the unlikely event that they are still in a draw, the player who has won the &quot;Amon-Ra&quot; card wins.&#10;&#10;1-PLAYER-VARIANT: &#10;In the 1-player variant, the Gods Cards, the hieroglyphics, the scarab tokens, the player scroll and the movement cards are required. &#10;The player at the beginning of the game has 3 Gods cards and must form his name with hieroglyphics in order to win the card. To buy a hieroglyph you must use an element card without distinction (in the normal version they are called movement cards).&#10;Once the name is formed, the corresponding God card will be discarded and another card can be drawn. For each God card won  you need to apply a scarab token to your Player scroll.  &#10;The game ends when the Gods card deck ends (you can decide at the beginning of the game if you prefer to play with fewer Gods cards).&#10;Calculation of points and winnings: After you have formed the name of the last God of the deck, proceed with the calculation of the score (5 points for each scarab token + the specific points of each God card).&#10;If the totalized score is higher than the number of the element cards paid, you win the game, otherwise you lose.&#10;You can also play this variant with more players!&#10;&#10;"

Them Red Devils are going to fight before day.&rdquo; &ndash;Comment by a member of the Indiana Militia on the evening of November 6, 1811 at the Tippecanoe Bend of Burnett&rsquo;s Creek, near Prophetstown.&#10;&#10;By early 1811, tensions in the western portion of Ohio and the remaining Northwest Territory were increasing almost daily. Conflict with Great Britain loomed, and the Native American inhabitants were also alarmed regarding increasing US settler encroachments on their lands in violation of the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskatawa (who many Americans nicknamed &ldquo;Prophet&rdquo;), traveled amongst the various tribes and nations seeking to unite the diverse native inhabitants into a force that could counter the growing US threat. Many of the followers of the brothers&rsquo; messages flocked to Prophetstown, where Tenskatawa took up residence, in the Indiana Territory. US General William Henry Harrison, alarmed at the growing force of Native American warriors, assembled an army and began moving towards Prophetstown.&#10;&#10;Tecumseh counseled that war had to be avoided until the British initiated hostilities with the US, which he believed would occur in 1812. However, Tenskatawa claimed in his visions that an earlier battle with Harrison&rsquo;s army would be successful. When Tecumseh set out in late October 1811 to travel one more time to meet with the Native American leaders that were not at Prophetstown, the Prophet took the opportunity to order a daring night time attack on the American army encamped nearby. One of the most epic battles fought between the US and the Native Americans was about to take place. Can you do as well, or better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of A Dark and Dastardly Fight is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    One 8.5 by 11 inch map with Turn Record Track.&#10;&bull;    90 double-sided counters.&#10;&bull;    This set of rules with Game Turn/Record Track.&#10;&#10;Players will also need a standard deck of playing cards (a custom card set for this and all of the other games in the Battles of Old Northwest series is available from the publisher) and a six sided die are needed to play the game.&#10;&#10;"

To aid progress through the lodge, Officers collect Gavels (An important Freemasonry device).

Completing a Toolset allows Officers to progress to higher or lower degrees throughout the game. Officers also need to sit in each of the Principal Officers seats, in turn: Inner Guard, Junior Deacon, Senior Deacon, Junior Warden, Senior Warden &amp; Worshipful Master. Achieving each seat also creates more opportunities to move between degrees. Landing on the Worshipful Master at any time also allows for movement between the 3 degrees. Throughout the Officers journey around the Lodge, there are several steps which provide additional help, or sometimes hindrances to progress. The Secretaries, Charity Stewards and Treasures issue summonses, by way of card selection. All of which must be obeyed.

The game ends immediately if a player takes the opposing flagship.&#10;&#10;The game may also end in a truce: either because neither player has enough forces left to capture the opposing flagship or because one is offered by one player. If the opposing player refuses the truce offer, he must win within 14 moves or the truce becomes automatic. The winner of a game ending in a truce is determined by the point values of opposing ships captured, between 1 and 5 each.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

In Twisted Fables players take on the roles of beloved heroines from some of history's most famous stories, myths, and legends. Plucked from their traditional settings, these characters have been thrown into a world of cybernetic assassins, magical manipulations, and malevolent darkness. These are not the classic characters you remember, but rather superpowered fables drawn from their own lands to battle across sweeping, bizarre alternate dimensions and realities. What mysterious force has drawn them together? What is the purpose of their war? Only the Weaver of Tales knows for certain.&#10;&#10;Driven by deck building, Twisted Fables is a game for two players in 1v1 Mode or four players in 2v2 Mode (available with the separately released 2v2 Upgrade Pack.) In the game, each warrior will strengthen their abilities, learn potent new skills, unlock devastating special powers, and use unique asymmetric strategies to defeat their opponents. Even the same character may display completely different fighting styles depending on her player's decisions. The different specializations a character can choose from not only provide fantastically flexible tactical choices, but also offer one more layer of depth and surprise to this frenetic, frantic fighter. Twisted Fables brings a highly interactive experience to deck builders that you'll want to come back to again and again.&#10;&#10;The book is opened. The fables have arisen.

Simple rules of movement and firing include all the most important features of the aircraft of the time: speed, agility and firepower. Battles are fought at five different altitudes, so there are differences between the planes in terms of climbing and descending speeds. Some specific characteristics were also taken into account, such as gyroscopic effect, which gives some aircraft exceptional maneuverability. Wind influences movement and the position of the sun affects firing accuracy, so these factors are also taken into account. A plane under attack can escape into the clouds and thus hide from the enemy. Most of the pilots are average, but there are also rookies and aces.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Standing high above all creation, the gods ruled this world and were worshipped by the creatures living there. This fact was enjoyed so immensely by the gods that some of them decided to decided to find a new world to create and spread even more of their stories and in doing so get more beings to worship them. On this new world, 7 gods from different ancient cultures send forth their envoys to spread word of their greatness, each aiming to become the most popular god of this new world.&#10;&#10;7 different gods with 7 different powers use their Envoys (player tokens) to gain points by Telling Stories (rolling D4 dice) and gain control over villages on Islands.

By playing a card she moves her Envoy to an Island and with the Dice she can Tell a Story (roll the dice) or perform other god actions. When you use the card to move you cannot use the card for other actions that might be on that card. You must make decisions every turn on what part of the cards you use; move or action.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player reaches a certain amount of victory points or when a certain amount of dice is in the Otherworld (the island in the middle of the game board). This threshold is determined at the start of the game and is affected by the number of players and / or experience.

It's now a whole lot more than the old game of line up 4!&#10;&#10;The games now range from the classic game of Align4 (4 in a row) to TorLord &ndash; the creative mode where you win title of TorLord or TorKing and the right to change and evolve your own rules of engagement with a diversified set of tokens.&#10;&#10;In between those games are the games of TorGalor and TorKings &ndash; both radical and massive improvements to the game of alignment that truly unleash the genre&rsquo;s strategic depth and gameplay diversity to the next level.&#10;&#10;Then there&rsquo;s the new interactive cooperative team play mode that blows the dynamics out of the water even further.   A game mode that really hits the sweet spot with satisfying, engaging fun for families and friends.&#10;New Developmental Tool:  With both enhanced strategy games and interactive cooperative team play, TorKings is a new cross purposed STEM and Social IQ building tool.  Idea for developing minds and team building alike.&#10;&#10;The Geek Spectrum:  TorKings gameplay is adaptive to suit the full spectrum of players. Pick your board size, pick your game and pick your team.  Wherever you lie on the spectrum &ndash; there&rsquo;s a game option to suit.&#10;&#10;As immersive and fun as good Euro-games are they are unfortunately cursed by lengthy rules that are difficult to access, long gameplay and lengthy setup.&#10;&#10;TorKings is a complete matrix of game options to suit your occasion. The rules are super accessible, the game depth is selectable from newb to guru, the game duration is also selectable, the setup practically instant, you can play on a single, double or triple sized board and you can play one-on-one or play interactively in teams! &ndash; That&rsquo;s one freaking convenient and dynamic piece of gameware!&#10;&#10;So players of all ages can dive into the fun of the game of their choice in no time. &ndash; Quick, easy, super engaging and a load of fun!&#10;&#10;Way Back: The classic game of alignment goes back 5 decades (released as Connect4 in 1974). It&rsquo;s one of the most popular board games in the western world.  We&rsquo;ve either grown up with it (or a clone) or we&rsquo;ve been adults with kids who have played it to infinity and beyond.&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s a classic - so why change it?  The answer is that the gameplay is massively underdeveloped!&#10;The telling proof of that is the general attrition of the game by the time players hit their tweens. Albeit - they then grow up and return to the game for a similar time period with their own kids!&#10;&#10;The reasons for tween attrition are many but the most important factor is that the gameplay of chasing a single alignment is not strategically rich enough to maintain interest for naturally expanding minds.  It&rsquo;s too confined, too routine and lacks diversity.  If only those problems could be fixed&hellip;&#10;&#10;By comparison other strategic games like Go and Chess have a good following as minds mature.  Those games have the strategic richness to match and engage evolving minds.&#10;But how do you make the game of alignment strategically richer to engage growing and mature minds? The answer is layered but here are the basic elements of the solution: &#10;1.    Kill the sudden death approach. &#10;   &bull;    Getting a single alignment is fun.  But getting multiple alignments is a lot more fun - so in the new rules a side wins by getting the most alignments in a game.&#10;   &bull;    That finally opens up the new possibility of getting more points for multiple alignments.&#10;   &bull;    As the game plays on through alignments there is a far richer move and counter-move dynamic set up.   The dynamic shift to achieving the more dynamic multiple alignments while of course blocking the bigger game or your opponent.&#10;   &bull;    Such a simple and obvious rule change &ndash; but with a massive cascade of instantly compounding strategic depth and dynamics&#10;&bull;    You now also get paid for each new alignment you make - from your opponents unplayed tokens.  That&rsquo;s also the super simple way you keep score! Again super satisfying and adding another layer of risk management, separation anxiety and competitive dynamics. &ndash; Genius!&#10;2.    Expand the game board size&#10;   &bull;    Modular board games allow the board to get wider and that finally allows the strategic development to expand.  The result - a massive increase in player engagement and satisfaction.&#10;3.    Introduce a diversity of token characters with new properties to meaningfully contribute to the gameplay and diversify game options further.  A satisfying upgrade for seasoned strategists.&#10;4.    Open up interactive co-op team play&#10;   &bull;    The modular boards are a total natural fit for others to join and play interactive cooperative team games.  The result is a further cascade in dynamics as the human element is introduced.  It&rsquo;s easily one of the most fun ways to play. It&rsquo;s also one of the most accessible co-op styled board-games in the world! A true contender that may finally bring cooperative styled boardgaming into the mainstream!&#10;Flexibility: The options above can be toggled on or off in different game options to allow players to grow into the new gameplay levels.  Combining all of the above entirely unleashes the true potential of the strategic alignment genre.  Once you play the new games it feels strange indeed that it&rsquo;s taken 5 decades to finally make this most obvious transition.&#10;&#10;The Revolutionary New Hardware:&#10;   &bull;    Smart Tokens: Now your tokens finally sort themselves and shoot straight back at you at the press of a button.  That gives you more game time and turns the tedious task of manually sorting tokens into a magic treat for everyone, every game!&#10;   &bull;    Modular Gameboards: Players can now join up to 3 boards together to make a bigger fully integrated board.  The result is a massive boost to gameplay diversity and depth.&#10;   &bull;    Iconic 3D tokens:  We&rsquo;ve turned design thinking inside out when we developed the TorKings tokens.  They are a mixture of sculpted 3D forms and voids beautifully framed by the surrounding torus.  They are a breakthrough in visual accessibility that allows token diversity to explode along with gameplay depth.  They are also very tactile and visually stunning in the game grid.&#10;   &bull;    Snap Latch : We&rsquo;ve put an end to the violation of your tokens randomly releasing in the middle of your game.  The snap latch snaps shut and secures your game.&#10;   &bull;    Spinners:  The tokens can spin in a variety of ways.  They are handy as timers, selectors and impressively cool play things in their own right.&#10;   &bull;    Safety:  The tokens re designed to allow airflow regardless of orientation in an airway. That allows parents to breathe a little easier when younger kids inadvertently wander into the mix.&#10;   &bull;    Premium Quality: We&rsquo;ve designed the game to be a very different premium journey for players of all ages. It&rsquo;s a completely new level of enjoyment and fun.&#10;&#10;Description from the designer - James T.&#10;&#10;"
