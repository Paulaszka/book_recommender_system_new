Players respond to ever-changing opportunities to invest in influence and colonial control in overseas territories to obtain wealth, strategic advantage, and prestige. Age of Imperialism substantially covers a full century of history with the shifts in technology, economic conditions, and politics that constantly changed the imperial equation. The future of the whole world has yet to be written; will Great Britain build an empire upon which the sun never sets, or will the French tricolour, the imperial Russian eagle, or the Stars and Stripes span the globe? &#10;  'Age of Imperialism recreates the imperial expansion of Europe, America and Japan in the nineteenth century, combining a strong historical component with a game system that encourages careful planning and player interaction whilst avoiding much of the bookkeeping tedium of comparable games on the subject. Each player manages one of the great imperial powers, managing its resources to enough develop economic, diplomatic and military power to earn a &quot;place in the sun&quot;. Intended to teach as well as to entertain, the game addresses the causes nineteenth-century imperialism as well as its effects on international relations amongst the imperial powers. &#10; Played on an authentic 19th-century map of the entire world, Age of Imperialism includes several scenarios, each playable in an afternoon, covering different stages of imperial expansion, as well as a campaign game that covers the entire century. It also includes rules for solitaire play. Complexity is medium (about 6/10).&#10;&#10;&#10;"

All major ships of the participating powers are included, including dreadnoughts, pre-dreadnoughts, and squads of lighter ships. Historically, the German fleet only challenged the British once, culminating in the Battle of Jutland. This game allows players to explore what might have happened had the Germans been more aggressive and persistent.&#10;&#10;The rules of High Seas Fleet are based on the rules system of the classic games of the 1970s, War At Sea and Victory in the Pacific. However, High Seas Fleet introduces a number of innovations to keep the system fresh. The combat system has been modified to mitigate the extremes of luck and Command Cards introduce a degree of both flexibility and uncertainty. Allies can enter based on your efforts to recruit them and stay or go based on your success on the high seas. The game system remains clean and simple, perfect for introducing youngsters or novices to historical gaming, yet substantial enough to reward the veteran gamer.&#10;&#10;Played on a map that includes the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Mediterranean regions, High Seas Fleet includes both introductory and standard rules, plus several scenarios including a single-turn, introductory scenario of the Battle of Jutland, and even some alternative history scenarios, as well as a campaign game that covers the entire war. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).&#10;&#10;&#10;"

It is a two-player game in which one player plays the military forces of the United States, and the other plays the forces of Great Britain. The U.S. player attempts to conquer Canadian territory and to compel Britain to sue for peace, while the British player attempts to do exactly the same against the United States, perhaps with the aid of some Native American allies. The fledgling United States are making a huge gamble. Can they drive the British from Canada and unify North America, or will the Empire strike back and put the upstarts in their place and end their dreams of &quot;manifest destiny&quot;?&#10;  Prominent military leaders, army strength points, Native American forces, and political concerns and conditions are all represented. Historically, British and U.S. forces, though sorely mismatched in terms of professionalism and leadership, fought each other to a stalemate. This game allows players not only to explore what conditions contributed to this outcome, but also whether the either might have been able to achieve a decisive victory that would have changed the shape of the North American continent. &#10; Played on an authentic early-19th-century map of the United States and Canada, 1812 includes both introductory and standard rules. Based on the rules system of the popular introductory game We The People, it is ideal for introducing youngsters and new players to the hobby, yet substantial enough to attract the veteran gamer. Complexity is low for the Basic Rules to moderate for the Standard Rules (about 2/10 to 3.5/10 respectively).&#10;&#10;"

Greenberg (co-creator of Wizardry), Rick Dutton, Walter Freitag, and Michael Massimilla.[2] In this first title, players leave their homeworlds setting out to explore the vast unknowns of space. Per the official game text:&#10;&#10;In 2815 A.D., the majority of the human race is afraid of space. They are cloistered in the Nine Worlds (Earth and eight colonized planets) in a region called the Galactic Fringe. Even though space travel has been practical since the invention of the dual-axis hyperdrive in 2257, humankind's attempt to colonize &quot;Beyond the Boundary&quot; came to an abrupt halt in 2490. The &quot;Space Plague,&quot; a gargantuan epidemic caused by an organism of alien origin, killed more than half the humanoid population of the galaxy, threatened the extinction of civilization, and forever changed mankind's attitude towards space.&#10;&#10;Now, a Space Patrol enforces the &quot;Boundary,&quot; that one-way border around the Nine Worlds in order to prevent anything like the &quot;Space Plague&quot; from ever happening again. Now, anyone may leave the area enclosed by the Boundary, but they may not return.&#10;&#10;Thus far, the Boundary has proven effective in keeping ships from entering the Nine Worlds for three centuries, keeping humanity safe from the unknown. Of course, this does provide for a bit of stagnation, as well. After all, no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless lost opportunities hardly seem compatible with a growing standard of living. Finally, there are those who sense that something is amiss... &quot;&#10;&#10;The game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.&#10;&#10; Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Star Saga: Two &#226;&#128;&#147; The Clathran Menace&#10;&#10;&#10;"

On their turns, the players may either play a card from their hands, or draw a card.  They must try to match one of their cards with the last card played, stating the English words associated with the root combination.  The game ends when a player runs out of cards or when the draw pile runs out.  The winner is the player with the highest number of points at the end of the game.  More difficult cards are worth more points, and cards left in your hand are counted against you.&#10;&#10;3.

When an orange card is placed atop and at right angles to a yellow card, the letters combine to form a potential word.&#10;&#10;In the main game, players are each dealt 2 yellow cards.  In a turn, a player draws 1 orange card from the draw or discard pile, and lays it on each of his yellow cards, pronouncing the &quot;word&quot; aloud.  Each yellow card that is part of a real word is turned down and saved, and replaced from the yellow deck; finally the orange card is discarded.  At the end of the game, the player with the most won yellow cards wins.  Players may be challenged if they fail to speak a word aloud, pronounce it wrong, or declare a nonexistent word; the loser of a challenge gives the winner one of his won yellow cards.&#10;&#10;In the Tic-Tac-Toe game, 9 yellow cards are dealt into a 3x3 array.  In a turn a player draws 1 orange card and lays it on an empty yellow card to form a word, placing one of his tokens on it; if it cannot be placed to make a real word, it's discarded.  A player wins on getting 3 tokens in a row; then the cards are discarded and a new yellow array is dealt.  Presumably, play continues until a certain number of games is won or time is expired.&#10;&#10;"
