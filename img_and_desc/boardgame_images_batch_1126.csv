It is not meant to be a hardcore military game and the results are not meant to be particularly realistic.&#10;&#10;-description from rulebook&#10;&#10;Battles are fought in phases with alternating activations: In the action phase your figures take turns carrying out one action (moving, firing, doing something else) while in the firefight phase most figures can fire (potentially shooting a second time).&#10;&#10;Combat uses a simple 2D6 table with several unexpected factors built in: Firers can fumble or inflict critical hits and the use of a separate Threat die can cause surprise reactions such as the targets diving for cover or firing back. Gun battles plays out quickly and chaotically.&#10;&#10;Intended for head-to-head play with 10 scenario objectives to pick from, but offers tools for non player forces and a random unit generator. These are great for solo play or to have a third party force show up mid battle if you like.&#10;&#10;With about 8-15 figures per side, SPiS occupies a middle ground between the man-to-man combat of Five Parsecs From Home and the larger battles of Renegade Scout / Clash on the Fringe by the same publisher.&#10;&#10;"

Humans lived on these fertile lands where multiple resources and animals were found.&#10;&#10;In Doggerland, you play a clan at around 15,000 BCE. Your goal is to expand your clan in order to leave a trace of its existence for centuries to come. Players increase their population, make crafts, paint murals in caves, raise megaliths for the gods, and (most of all) survive the rigors of the seasons. To do this, they explore the surrounding territory and adapt to the resources at their disposal. The territory differs in each game, thanks to modular tiles.&#10;&#10;Each round, players program their actions, then carry them out. These actions vary, based on available resources, abundance or scarcity around their villages, and also based on the actions of other players. As time passes, resources run out, and clans must migrate to find what they need for their development and survival.&#10;&#10;In each clan, there is a leader who brings bonuses, and a shaman who allows powerful and unique actions thanks to knowledge and magic.

Though the land that surrounds Cozy Oaks is breath-taking, the village itself needs a bit of work. Mayor Williams had an idea that could bring business back into this little town -- Restore the farmlands! Help wanted signs were posted on every corner and as luck would have it, you have taken interest. However, it appears that you have competition.&#10;&#10;The Mayor is willing to give each of you 3 years, during which, you will need to grow crops, care for animals, mine for ores, craft new equipment, and do the occasional fishing. If you have the most Star Points at the end of the 3 years, you will be deemed the official Farmer of Cozy Oaks!&#10;&#10;Cozy Oaks is unique in that it uses a hand of cards, called Skills, in a very clever way. Each farmer has 10 Skills in their hand, and most Skills will cost time. The player must discard Skills from their hand in order to satisfy this cost, giving the player less decisions for future turns. As the seasons and years pass, players will be upgrading their Skills. And just like life, the more interest you have in a Skill, the more time it takes up in your day. Players will need to upgrade wisely. The only way to retrieve the played and discarded Skills is for the player to Sleep. This allows the player to regain all of their cards back. Each decision is crucial, from playing certain Skills and when to spend time on other things.&#10;&#10;GAME SUMMARY&#10;&#10;Cozy Oaks is played over 3 Years with each year split into 4 Seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter for a total of 12 rounds. Each player moves at their own pace. This means that one player may be on Year 2 Spring while the other player is still on Year 1 Fall. The goal in Cozy Oaks is to have the most Star Points at the end of the game. To achieve this, players must play Skill cards to work on their farms or visit locations in town. Players will need to manage their resources and time wisely.&#10;&#10;Each player will begin the game with all ten Level 1 Skill cards in their hand. They will set their Level 2 and Level 3 decks aside for now. Each of the Level 2 and 3 decks can be looked through at any time.&#10;&#10;PLAYER'S TURN&#10;&#10;1) The player MUST choose a Skill card from their hand to play.&#10;&#10;2) Be sure to pay for the Time Cost, if any.&#10;&#10;3) The chosen Skill card is placed face up on the table in front of the player.&#10;&#10;3a) Cards that were discarded for paying the Time Cost are placed face down and sideways next to the played Skill card.&#10;&#10;3b) Be sure to keep the &ldquo;Played Skill&rdquo; pile separate from the &#10;&ldquo;Discarded Time&rdquo; pile.&#10;&#10;3c) Cards that have been played or discarded remain on the table until the player plays their Sleep Skill in which all cards will be returned to their hand.&#10;&#10;4) The player then performs the Skill card&rsquo;s effect.&#10;&#10;5) After the player has completed their Skill, it is then the other player&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The cities represented - in addition to Berlin - are Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Moscow, Paris Bonn, Prague, Vienna, Lisbon, Madrid, Rome and Sofia.&#10;Points are awarded at the end of a game for each chain of two or three adjacent cities the two players have Agents or Moles in.  Chains can be orthogonal or diagonal.  Chains of two earn 2 points and chains of three 3 points.  Berlin cannot be used to accumulate points but has a special role in the game in that it is the only location on the board in which &lsquo;stacking&rsquo; is allowed.  At player discretion however &lsquo;supremacy&rsquo; in Berlin may be used to adjudicate ties.&#10;&#10;Players can do one of the following five things on their turn:&#10;1 Place one of their pieces in any one of the sixteen cities, provided the space representing that city is empty.&#10;2 Relocate one of their own pieces already on the board to any other city, provided the space representing the new location is empty.&#10;3 Place a piece as 1 above and then &ldquo;shunt&rdquo; it and all other pieces one location in any single orthogonal plane. *&#10;4 Place a piece in Berlin or &ldquo;stack&rdquo; a piece on an opponent&rsquo;s piece already there. (Maximum stack: one piece each.) &#10;5 Use the topmost piece in Berlin, if it is theirs, to shunt a piece or pieces along any one of the four diagonal planes extending from the city. *&#10;&#10;[*Note: If a piece is shunted off the board, it enters the other player&rsquo;s hand, irrespective of allegiance.]&#10;&#10;Scoring examples are illustrated in the rules located in the files section.&#10;&#10;Notes on restrictions and other essential rules:&#10;In the basic game, players cannot &ldquo;relocate&rdquo; their adversary&rsquo;s pieces.  They can only be moved by &lsquo;shunting&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Players cannot forego their turn if they possess unplaced pieces.&#10;&#10;&lsquo;Shunting&rsquo; is orthogonal from the 16 cities comprising the 4-by-4 board.  It is diagonal from Berlin.&#10;&#10;A piece passed to a player as a result of shunting should not be examined by the shunting player.  The player receiving the piece will be able to look at its hidden side once it is in their hand.&#10;&#10;Pawns and stacking&#10;Players preferring to use pawns for playing pieces can simulate stacking by the way the pawns are positioned in the Berlin space on the board &ndash; a Top and Bottom within the space is clearly apparent.&#10;     &#10;Variant rules&#10;A number of variant rules can be adopted at set-up by mutual agreement of the players.  These are included with the base game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Both enemy waves and cards eligible to be recruited are randomized (drawn from a previously shuffled deck).&#10;&#10;During Combat Steps, your military cards can be played to destroy aliens or to repair your defenses. Then, surviving aliens damage your base back, deactivating your Shields and eventually lowering its Constitution rating.&#10;&#10;Your scientific cards grant victory points and useful abilities, but eventually clog up your deck leaving your base vulnerable.

Our plan is to deploy there different operational bases so that our scientific personnel can carry out tests and measurements.&#10;&#10;Our presence will attract hostile response. General, your mission is to defend one of those bases to the best of your ability, so you can then withdraw with the maximum amount of data and samples.

Van Helsing must remove all of Dracula's life points to win, but if Dracula turns all four inhabitants of the same district into vampires first, Dracula wins.&#10;&#10;The game lasts at most five rounds. Each round, players play in turn (starting with Dracula), drawing a card, then discarding that card or swapping it with one of the five cards on their rack to trigger the discarded card's ability. Cards come in eight types, each with its own effect. Instead of drawing (and discarding) a card, a player can call for the end of the round. In order to choose this action, at least six cards need to be in the discard pile. After the opponent plays one last turn, the round ends; otherwise, the round ends when the deck is empty.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, players compare the five cards on their rack. Each card corresponds to one of the five districts on the game board. If Dracula has the higher-valued card, one of the humans in this district is converted into a vampire; if Van Helsing is higher, Dracula loses a health point.

Trading Card Game!&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards they will use to battle against an opponent to become a champion. Cards come in four types: Beast, Wish, Grotto and Challenger. Beast cards use their power to attack an opponent's team, while the Grotto cards boost the power or abilities of Beasts. The Wish cards give players extra tricks up their sleeves to pull off special effects. Challengers are used for the special Jerma Rumble variant of the game, letting players team up with the characters of Jerma985's jermaverse.&#10;&#10;As players summon cards from their hand, they add cards to their Summoning Pool while their opponent draws cards from their Summoning Pool.

He will be glad if a certain horse ends the season at a certain rank and he will appreciate your help in the matter. Other players are Don's other fixers with similar, non-contradictory errands. You will play as a team trying to accomplish as many orders as possible, because if someone screws up, Don will not care who and will be disappointed in all you.

In the beginning everyone knows one secret order but some orders may not be known by anyone.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will choose a race card from your hand to play. Every card moves multiple horses and makes progress towards one useful action or another. You will need to make hard decisions where all your moves are ambiguous and what benefits a task often harms another task. The game also includes events that introduces further randomness, a betting system and secondary tasks that give some immediate benefits and victory points.&#10;&#10;Code of Silence is a funny yet challenging game with medium complexity where strategy, communication, deduction, intuition play equal parts.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
