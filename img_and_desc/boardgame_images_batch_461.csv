The board is double sided - one side is a ludo game with standard ludo rules, and the other side is a straightforward roll-and-move game which is a race around the board, the winner being the first to cross all the bridges.  The thing that the game is most remembered for is its Dizzy Dice character used to roll the dice.  This is a transparent red plastic cube with legs and pressing down on the top of its head causes two dice inside to bounce around.  One dice is a standard 1-6 and the other has coloured spots.&#10;&#10;"

Such a square is called a King-Square. The first player, or partners, to complete five such King-Squares have won the game.&#10;&#10;Instructions For Two Players:&#10;&#10;Opposing players use different sets of colored pegs. Players take turns alternately in playing a peg in any unoccupied position of the playing field. They continue to do so until one player has completed a the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color. As soon as a King-Square has been made the successful player records the square on his score board. All the pegs are then removed from the playing field and the loser starts play to build another King-Square. This process is repeated after each square is completed until one player has build five such squares with pegs of his own color. The first player to to do so has won the game.&#10;&#10;Building King-Square&#10;&#10;The first player to complete the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color has a King-Square. It makes no difference how many pegs of his own color, or of his opponent, are inside this square - or on the sides of the square - or in between his pegs on the four corners of the square - all that matters is that all the pegs on the four corners of the square are pegs of his own color.&#10;&#10;Squares made at an angle do not count. A King-Square must be parallel to the sides of the playing field and the rows and columns of holes. A square must be made up of four sides of equal length. A square is a figure having four equal sides and four right angles. A rectangle is not a square.&#10;&#10;Partnership play - four players&#10;&#10;As in Bridge, four players can play as two pairs of partners, each pair sitting opposite each other. Each pair uses pegs of the same color, dividing the pegs between them at the start of the game. All four players take turns alternately in placing their pegs, going clockwise around the table. As soon as a King-Square has been made it is recorded and a new square is started. As with two players, the game is won by the partners who are first to complete five King-Squares.&#10;&#10;"

94556,,"2000 Miles to Paradise is a fast paced game of auto combat. Players take on the role of scavengers trying to survive in a savage wasteland, filled only with road, sand and danger. Each has heard rumors that there is a paradise, and it&rsquo;s about 2000 miles away. To get there, the player will have to face many battles, and manage their resources well enough to reach their goal. 2000 Miles to Paradise is not meant to simulate real-world physics, rather it mimics the fast paced and frantic combat found in movies like Mad Max.&#10;&#10;Vehicle customization and combat have been streamlined for fast play, yet allow players to be creative. Players start by selecting a vehicle type, then spend salvage points on various modifications. The players then assign bonus dice to sections of the vehicle to tune the attributes of their vehicle.&#10;&#10;The game is then played in a series of duels, with each player fighting to drive 2000 miles to reach the rumored paradise. Each duel won gets the driver 200 miles closer, as well as gas, ammo and salvage to upgrade their car. If the scavenger loses a duel though, it's all over. Do you have what it takes to reach paradise?&#10;&#10;"

Green cards give you items to sell later at businesses; purple cards provide an immediate action, such as additional movement, gem theft, missed turns, and so on; red cards allow you to attack another player or defend against attacks. If in a business, the player sells as many green cards as desired, collecting gems for the goods sold.&#10;&#10;If being used, Brawl cards can be played when two gnomes land in the same space. If they agree to brawl, each player chooses one card from his personal deck, then simultaneously reveal them.

Players lead their armies across a battlefield to clash with their opponent, employing hand management, resource allocation and battlefield strategy to outwit each other. Players deploy troop cards to a grid battlefield and pay tactical points to move, attack and cast spells. Skills and Spells are taught to a player's entire army and reused each turn. Each player chooses from a selection of victory conditions and must achieve three victory conditions to win the match.&#10;&#10;The first chapter of Conquest Tactics features three army factions, but troops from different factions may be combined into one deck. The initial factions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Humans: A balanced faction with a wide variety of Spells and Skills&#10;    Kaborha: A powerhouse faction with strong, expensive troops and an emphasis on melee skills&#10;    The Malice: A swarming faction with overwhelming numbers and a penchant for dark magic&#10;&#10;&#10;For five hundred years, human civilization languished under the rule of the Kaborha, a society focused solely on honor, battle, and a tri-annual tournament for supremacy.  Now a young hero has emerged, bringing hope of returning humanity to its former glory. But even as Humans rise up against their oppressors, a new threat has come to their world.  The Malice -an interdimensional army of evil creatures- has descended upon the homeland of the Kaborha and Humans, lurching the Fire Continent out of a centuries long stagnation and into war! Traditional ways will be broken and unlikely alliances formed to repel the oncoming evil. Only you have the power to determine the future of the Fire Continent and the world of Yen-Sen.&#10;&#10;The time has come for you to lead your chosen forces into battle in Conquest Tactics, a new strategy card game.  Choose your Victory Conditions and your Base, assemble your Troops and march them across the battlefield.  Teach them Spells and Skills to use again and again, and empower them with Equipment.  Bend fate in your favor with Circumstance cards, and claim powerful relics as your Trophies.  Vanquish your enemies by using real strategy, movement and range to your advantage. Never before has a collectible card game given you this much control and this level of strategic choice.&#10;&#10;Rather than pursue a single goal, Conquest Tactics has several different Victory Conditions that can be achieved in order to win. You might choose to invade and occupy your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field, destroy their base, challenge troops that are stronger than your own, or upgrade a troop to it&rsquo;s highest potential.  As a reward for achieving a Victory Condition, you are bestowed a Trophy which grants a special onetime benefit, such as the ability to draw extra cards, deal additional damage or search for the perfect troop you need at the moment.&#10;&#10;Each army in Conquest Tactics has its own types of troops. Unique to the world of Conquest Tactics are the Kaborha, a strong and proud race matching the cunning of humans with raw animalistic power. Troop cards have deployment, movement, and attack costs. The troop card also lists the damage done by the troop in an attack and the ability of the troop to defend itself. Finally, each troop card details the health of the troop and any special abilities that unit may have.  Some troops have the ability to cast magic or use special skills.&#10;&#10;When your Troops can't get by on courage alone, give them Equipment to better their chances of survival.  Equipment comes in three varieties: Armor, Weapons and Accessories.  These improvements attach directly to a Troop, making it more powerful in the midst of battle.  Troops may also use spells and skills on the battlefield.  Spell cards consist of fire, light and dark magic that may be used to heal, harm, cripple and defend in battle. However, only troops that are able to cast a particular type of magic are able to use that magic's spells. These abilities are put into your Knowledge Pool where they may be used repeatedly throughout the game by your various troops, but they have a cost each time they are used and may only be used once per turn.&#10;&#10;Each deck has one base which serves as a stronghold and is one of the principal sources of a player's power.  Bases give their armies additional strengths such as the ability to upgrade troops faster or replace fallen troops. However, Bases are not without their weakness as they may be destroyed, removing the benefits granted by it.&#10;&#10;Circumstance cards may be played at any time and do not need to be cast by a troop with the ability to use magic.  These cards may enable you to increase your tactical points, negate an attack or even reflect an attack back at a troop when your opponent least expects it!  Circumstance cards are paid for using the cards in your hand. If you don't have enough cards to discard from your hand you can't use your circumstance cards, thus hand management is another essential skill in Conquest Tactics.&#10;&#10;"

94713,,"Originally created for a now-defunct contest in December 2010, which required that the game be playable in the iggc sandbox, use conversion capture, and be won by the player with the majority of stones.  Though the game can as easily be played with pen and paper, and with variable victory thresholds rather than balancing stones, the rules are presented here as submitted.&#10;&#10;Basic rules:&#10;Players alternately place one stone at a time in an empty space on a board with an odd number of hexagonal cells.  Normally, Black may only place white stones, while White may place either white or black stones.  If the placement of a white stone completes one or more unbroken rows of four or more white stones, all stones in these rows flip to black.  When the board is full, the player with more stones of their color on the board wins.&#10;&#10;Balancing stones:&#10;On most standard boards, White has a small but definite advantage. It is suggested to give Black a limited number of black stones which may be played at any time during the game in place of their usual white stone. Though a 'pie-rule' arrangement can ensure that both players agree on the appropriate number of such stones, CPU self-play suggests the following setups as fair, and the 9x9x9 is particularly recommended.&#10;&#10;6x6x6    Black gets 5 black stones, white gets first move.&#10;7x7x7    Black gets 4 black stones and first move.&#10;8x8x8    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.&#10;9x9x9    Black gets 3 black stones, White gets first move.&#10;10x10x10 Black gets 2 black stones and first move.&#10;&#10;Note that once one accounts for the balancing stones, players may mark cells which can no longer be flipped as white, since Black may not play a black stone there, and White should never choose to.&#10;&#10;(submitted by designer)&#10;&#10;"

95026,,"Quest Chess was self-published by Donald, in 1974. It is a Chess variant. It consists of an A4 sheet of rules.&#10;(Conquest on the Chess board)&#10;Quest-Chess is played with a standard chess set. The moves of the pieces are the same as in regular Chess. White begins by making any five moves. After that, each player may make up to ten moves per turn. However, no piece may be moved more than once during your turn, unless that piece has first made a capture, or has moved to create a check. You may pass your turn any time after making at least one move.&#10;When you make a capture you must stop and give your opponent the opportunity to capture your piece which made the capture. He has one move in which to do this, but may make this 'recapture' in any way possible. He may also refuse to recapture. Once he has made his recapture (or refused to recapture) you then continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and you may again move that piece which made the capture any time during your turn.&#10;If you make a capture on your last move, your opponent does not get a free recapture, as it is then his turn and he must start counting his moves. If he then captures, you may recapture. If you intend to capture and pass, you must announce your pass when making the capture.&#10;When you put your opponent in check, you must stop and allow him one move to get out of check. He may capture the checking piece, he may interpose, or he may move the king. Once he is out of check, you continue on with the rest of your ten moves, and that piece which moved to create the check may move again. If you check your opponent's king on your last move, it is then his turn and he must count his first move in getting out of check.&#10;Castling is considered a king move. Therefore, if you castle, the king may not move again, but the castled rook may still move.&#10;If you move a pawn two spaces, passing your opponent's pawn on the fifth rank, you must allow him the immediate option to capture 'en passant'. When a pawn is promoted to a major piece, that 'new' piece may move on the same turn.&#10;You may never make a move that exposes your king to check, regardless of whether the checking piece has already moved. If your opponent puts you in check by making a recapture and the only way to get out of check is by moving a piece that you have previously moved on that turn, then this is permissible even if it involve a capture. However, if you have a way of getting out of check by moving a previously unmoved piece, you must take that alternative.&#10;When a player is in check and cannot get out of check in one move, it is checkmate, and the game is over. Sometimes checkmate may occur on a recapture. If ten consecutive turns are made without moving a pawn and without capturing a piece, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;"
