Two players, X and O, take turns placing a bridge between any two of their adjacent pegs not blocked by an existing bridge. The first player to complete a connected chain of bridges between their sides wins. Ties are not possible.&#10;&#10;Visavis is a Shannon switching game on the edges and belongs to the same class of connection games as Bridg-It and TwixT (and to some extend Trellis). Even though a trivial winning strategy has been found for Bridg-It (called Connexxions on the server) Visavis consists of a more complex system of overlaid triangular grids that allows richer variety of play, and no winning strategy is known.&#10;&#10;Michail Antonow points out that different tactics must be applied when blocking an opponent's rightward path as opposed to a leftward path. The path can be abruptly cut by a single piece in one direction only; in the opposite direction a single bridge will only divert the path and two bridges are needed for a successful block.&#10;&#10;The rules state that a bridge can be placed between any two adjacent pegs of the same colour. However since it can never help to place a bridge between the opponent's pegs, then it is assumed that all moves are made between the current player's pegs. This also simplifies the board notation.&#10;&#10;"

With two people playing, deal 9 cards to each, three playing, 8 cards, and four playing 7 cards. Place remainder of pack face down in center of table and turn over the top card to start the face up stack. Player at dealer&rsquo;s left starts by drawing a card from either stack, or by calling for a card from some other player. He must have at least one of the cards in the category for which he is calling. If successful he may call again from the same person until unsuccessful and then must discard one card on face up stack, which completes his turn. Then, the next player to left follows the same procedure.&#10;&#10;Complete categories, and meld them, face up, in front of you as fast as possible. A player may pick up all the cards in the face up stack at any turn, but must meld at least one complete category after so doing. You must meld at least two categories before you can meld the single UN card. When any player has no cards left after his discard - the hand ends, and he scores a bonus of 100 for going out. Cards held by other players are discarded for next deal and each scores the total of the value of each card in their meld. Play for time available - highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

The rules are as in the 2D game played by children except that the players move in three directions.

110724,,"3-Squared is a dice rolling game where players try to score the lowest number of points. The game ends when one player reaches 150 points.&#10;&#10;Overview:&#10;The game begins when the first player rolls the 9 3-Squared Dice.  8 of the dice are colored with blue (3 sides), purple (2 sides) and red (1 side).  The 9th die has 3 blue sides with a 10 on it, 2 purple sides with a 20 and 1 red side with 40 printed on it.  The object is to NOT roll all of the sides with the same color and complete the 3-Square.&#10;&#10;After the dice are rolled all players examine the results.  The Score Die is set in the center of the play area and all other dice that are the same color are set along side it.  If all of the other 8 dice are the same color as the Score Die, the player has completed the 3-Square, the round ends and the player who rolled the dice scores the points showing on the Score Die.  If any of the other 8 dice are not the same color, play passes to the next player.  The second player rolls all of the remaining dice that do not match the color of the Score Die and the other dice that were not set aside.  Play continues in this manner until all of the dice match the color of the Score Die and the player who completed the 3-Square.&#10;&#10;There are two little tricks however that can alter the gameplay.  The first is the 10th die...called the Event Die, it has six different sides that can change the results of the dice rolls.  One can end the round immediately, even if the 3-Square has not been completed.  One can allow the player who completed the 3-Square to pass the points to a different player, others double, or even triple the points showing on the Score Die.&#10;&#10;Each player is also given 3 Pass Tokens which they can use to skip their turn rolling the dice, shifting the turn to the next player.  The 3 Tokens are not renewable so players must be careful when using them.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     3-Squared Dice (10 Total)&#10;     Pass Tokens (18 Total)   &#10;&#10;&#10;"

Your key pieces are squadrons that you move around the board in stacks. The board itself being gridded into systems (where resources are located) and subsectors (empty space). Squadrons move from square-to-square on the board as in Chess. As the game proceeds, stargates twist space so that squares change their position relative to one another.&#10;&#10;Another big difference from Chess is that conflicts are resolved using tactical core cards that will feel to you more like rock-paper-scissors. Unlike in Chess, attacking pieces won't always win. Furthermore you will get free moves and other kinds of special actions through playing Imperial edict cards.&#10;&#10;The most destructive force in the game are antimatter missiles. You build missiles in stages on your systems and launch them during your turn. These missiles are the reason why the goal of the game &mdash; collecting three different deep-defense codes &mdash; is so important. Missile detonations destroy everything in a square and even burn up the square itself so that nothing can enter it. Owning three colors of deep-defense codes makes some of your squares immune to antimatter detonations, upsetting the balance of power and giving you a chance to win.&#10;&#10;"

On a turn, the active player draws and reveals four cards, then places a bid face-down on the table; while the bid itself is secret, other players can see how many money cards you included in the bid. Each player in turn places a secret bid, then they reveal these bids. Whoever offers the most money takes the footballer of his choice and places it in an empty position in his team line-up on the game board, then the second-highest bidder does the same, and so on. If a player has no money, he takes the last card on offer. The active player position rotates to the left, then players each bid on and draft another card.&#10;&#10;In addition to acquiring high-valued footballers, players are trying to fill their team with a proper line-up of players &ndash; midfielders in the midfield, three defenders and a keeper in the back, and so on &ndash; as they score bonus points when those sections have the properly positioned players in them. When a player drafts an &quot;ersatz&quot; (substitute) footballer, it can replace any footballer already in play and it counts as being in the proper position; the drawback is that an ersatz player is worth no points on its own.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds of drafting, each player will have a full line-up and one player on the sidelines; this player can be substituted for any other footballer already on the team, even if the substitute is not labeled &quot;ersatz&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players then tally their player points and any bonus points for completing a section with the proper footballers.
