There are circular depressions around the circumference of the maze where steel balls are placed and thus affect the way the maze tilts.&#10;&#10;There are nine balls in all - eight smaller steel balls and a larger 'counteract' ball which is placed in the maze.  The counteract ball must be manipulated into a depression located at the center of the maze by careful placement of the steel balls around the perimeter.  Players must move three steel balls per turn.&#10;&#10;The first player who causes the counteract ball to roll into the central depression (the 'winner's circle') is the winner.&#10;&#10;

Like other games in the series, the pieces are wooden and terribly cute, especially the tiny die.&#10;&#10;To start, the two sheep are placed at equal distances from the box they came in. Varying this distance will determine how long the game is. During a player's turn, he can create a path to the box using up to four clover leaves (slight ambiguity in the rules here: initially the rules say 3 then say 4). However, before he can place each leaf, he must roll the die. Rolling a clover leaf means the player can continue to add clover leaves, or the player can stop and move his sheep ahead of the last clover leaf placed (i.e. nearer to the box). If instead a wolf's head is cast, the player's sheep is so frightened that it is unable to move that turn. The player whose sheep reaches the box first is crowned King of the Sheep and wins the heart of the woman shepherd, Edda.&#10;&#10;&lt;!-- Entry audited by (nsolitander) (13-08-2009) --!&gt;&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The interplanetary federation (IPF) has done a great job in the last centuries. All necessary precautions have been taken to conquer this planet named &quot;Steam&quot;. The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.&#10;&#10;But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.&#10;&#10;Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious. However, only through shrewd resource management and clever manipulation of supply and demand can a player reign supreme!&#10;&#10;"

Lord Sagen Ray&hellip;..you are nothing but a miserable master of falsehoods, an overlord of deception and, worst yet&hellip;&hellip;..a loathsome heart breaker!!!!&#10;&#10;Nadia burst into tears and dashed toward a grove of pine.  The music began once again but the party was disrupted, for the second time, when an arrow flying through the air with the force of the devil speared and lodged into Lord Sagen Ray's head. Sagen's blood covered body then fell upon the grave of Sir Matthew Tudworthy.&#10;&#10;Now it is time to join the Bogey Mann; Count and Countess Cadaver; the Grave Harbor Butcher; the Cemetery Skreecher; Boney Baloney; Black Beauty (the Headless Horsewoman); the ghosts of Sir Matthew Tudworthy and Lord Sagen Ray and many, many other creatures of the night.
