Players take turns raising the number by playing a prime number with cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;This game uses 54 standard playing cards with two jokers included. Suit doesn't matter in this game. Shuffle the deck and deal 11 cards to each player.&#10;&#10;The leader plays any prime number (see below). Then in clockwise order, players may play greater prime numbers with the same number of cards as the leader. The round continues until no player wants to play. The last player who played a valid number leads the next round.&#10;&#10;To play a prime number, take a certain number (or any number if you are the leader) of cards from your hand and arrange their order to indicate a number. If the number is prime, your play is valid. Consider Ace as 1, and 10, J, Q, and K as two-digit numbers (10, 11, 12, and 13 respectively). For example, you may play 3 and J in two ways, 311 and 113 (both are prime numbers), but you may play 3 and 5 as 53 only, because 35 is not a prime number. There's a penalty when you play an invalid (non-prime) number.&#10;&#10;You win the game when you get rid of all cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#153;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#232;&#187;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#230;&#166;&#130;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;11&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#230;&#133;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#164;&#135;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129

Germany broadly uses Enigma rotor cipher machines. The breaking of the Enigma code gives the Allies an advantage in the war &mdash; but this is just one side of the coin because the Enigma code is based on chaos, a non-measurable force lurking beyond the boundaries of our world and eager to consume all its flesh. The code decryption would stop the chaos invasion into our world.&#10;&#10;An &quot;Agency&quot; operates in a secret heavily-guarded Victorian mansion somewhere in London suburbs; it has been opposing the supernatural for centuries. To break the Enigma code, the Agency has gathered the world's best decrypters together. You are one of them. Your mission is to break the Enigma code as soon as possible while wandering inside the mansion with an ever-changing layout. At least, you tell others so. In fact, you might pursue completely different goals...&#10;&#10;Enigma: Beyond Code is a game of deduction. Victory depends on your ability to understand the motives of other players and locate the cards you need &mdash; while keeping others away from the cards they are looking for. Each play takes 5-10 minutes, and it is best to play Enigma: Beyond Code up to three victories.&#10;&#10;In the beginning, each player receives a character card featuring a cryptology expert who has arrived at the Agency's mansion to break the Enigma code. But only one of them is the true decrypter; the others are just masterfully posing as cryptologists. Each of them has a unique secret mission. To accomplish the missions of their characters, the players view mansion cards in turns; each of these cards represents a room or an object inside the mansion. The invited experts work as a team, which means that upon looking at a mansion card, you must tell others what is there. You may either lie or tell the truth &mdash; that depends on your goals. Lying is always a risk, while telling the truth may allow your opponents to win.&#10;&#10;The player who first accomplishes their character's mission wins the game.

One way or another, you have fallen to the lich Yor'Mir. They have locked your soul within their phylactery, along with their other victims they have slain. Within this cursed orb exists a demi plane known as the Ragnorwald. A cursed forest with one purpose: to kill its residents. Death is not permanent within this realm, but it is costly. With each death, the victim loses a cherished memory, which forms into ghostly blue crystals known as Essence. This Essence is what Yor'Mir desires, and as such is used as currency within the Ragnorwald. Once drained of all your memories, you become Forgotten.&#10;&#10;But fear not, all hope is not lost. There is a way out, a gate which Yor'Mir uses to check on the Ragnorwald. Two small problems: First, whenever someone uses the gate, the Ragnorwald is reset. The second is the gate is guarded by a Keeper, a twisted monstrosity placed by Yor'Mir to keep the residence of the forest from escaping. Luckily for you, you are a Champion. A being capable of Awakening these memories. Remember your powers from your past life, collect essence to purchase powerful Items, and defeat the Keeper. However, you are not the only one with this plan...

Inspired by epic fantasy games such as Talisman, Runebound and Mage Knight, Journey takes these long winded, large scale games and condenses it into a shorter more palatable experience. Players will notice right away that in the Ragnorwald, death is not only common and inconsequential, but often convenient. Fast paced highly strategic deterministic combat keeps the game flowing, and it's heavy player vs player elements keeps players interested even when it isn't their turn. Move around the board, choosing which stories to Encounter. Each Encounter type offers different risks and rewards, from fighting Goblins, exploring Dungeons, and even discovering critical information about the Ragnorwald itself.&#10;&#10;Tabletop Simulator Link&#10;https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1510019854&#10;&#10;Discord&#10;https://discord.gg/GnV5TpyMAg&#10;&#10;YouTube Tutorials&#10;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSq5JJx-Oy7wecuwMQBVirw&#10;&#10;"
