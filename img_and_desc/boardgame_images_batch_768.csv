Instead, players decide as a group who will turn the next chapter card, and there are often grisly consequences for the one that does!&#10;&#10;Once revealed, the chapter card will explain the situation facing the group and what must be done to get through it. In the style of choose-your-path adventures, most chapters offer the group a choice about how to proceed. Bribe the drunken guards or attack them? Charge the beast or lure it out? Steal from the kitchen stores or keep moving?&#10;&#10;Each chapter is a mini-game and a variety of mechanics are required to complete it, from RPG-style skill tests for an individual character, to push-your-luck dice rolling as a team, to the playing of item cards collected along the way to bolster the tactical abilities of the group.&#10; &#10;When the players choose to enter (or fail to avoid) combat, all players roll their unique character dice simultaneously to make an attack against the enemy. They need to collectively muster the right combination of Might, Cunning and Wisdom to defeat the foe in question, or risk taking damage. Blocking, Resting, and the use of Weapons, Relics and Potions will help to keep the prisoners alive.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is for the group to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss.

In November 1914, Russia's 3rd Army pressed on Krakow, the center of Austrian Poland, while the Russian 8th Army threatened to break through the Carpathian passes into Hungary.  Desperate to relieve the pressure, Franz Conrad von H&ouml;tzendorf, Chief of the General Staff for Austria-Hungary, gambled on a counter attack about 25 miles southwest of Krakow.&#10;&#10;Conrad launched his 4th Army into the thinly held, 20-mile wide gap between the Russian 3rd and 8th Armies on December 3.  Austro-Hungarian forces rolled forward about 12 miles in just three days along a front from Lipanow in the north to Limanowa in the south.  Russian resistance stiffened on the 6th with fierce fighting erupting around the village of Limanowa.  Several days of see-saw action ensued until the lines crystallized on December 11.&#10;&#10;For once, Conrad's daring paid off.  In response to his gains, the Russians scrambled to secure their front and so abandoned plans to drive on Krakow and Hungary.  Conrad, however, paid a heavy price by suffering 12,000 casualties and expending the last of his elite 14th &quot;Innsbruck&quot; infantry corps to stop the Russians who easily absorbed and replaced their 30,000 losses.  Never again would the Austro-Hungarian Army win an independent victory; from now on, all progress depended on German participation.&#10;&#10;LLL is the second volume in the Red Poppies Campaign (RPC) system for gaming World War I battles.
