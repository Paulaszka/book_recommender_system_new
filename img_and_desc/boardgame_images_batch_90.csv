Just change the color of Goofy's socks with the Goofy sock dialer.  If his socks don't match, that's totally Goofy.  Now you get to move your pawn.  You may even get to spin a spinner to try and collect a Goofy figure.  But watch out.  If Goofy's socks do match, that's not Goofy at all. You must give up Goofy.  If you're the first player to collect four Goofy scoring figures, you're the goofiest of all.  You win.&#10;&#10;"

10300,,"Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #220.&#10;&#10;Group of Soviet Forces Germany features a simulation of a hypothetical Soviet invasion of Germany in the late 1970's. It is a two-player alternative history game intended to examine what could've happened during the first month of fighting had the Soviets opted to invade Germany during the Cold War.  An assumption is made that the invasion would've been executed without lengthy preparation or forewarning.&#10;&#10;This game is an update and revision of SPI's 1973 release, &quot;NATO: Operational Combat in Europe in the 1970s&quot;. Its time and space scales have been preserved, but the map has been improved by reflecting a more in depth terrain analysis. The system has been updated and the orders of battle are more fully developed. Air warfare has been added, at least as an abstract, and tactical nukes have been taken away except as possible game enders.&#10;&#10;The orders of battle for both sides are based on open-source documents that have become available since the parent game was first published. The system, though more complex than that of the original game, still comes in toward the lower end of today's complexity scale. Experienced gamers can expect to be blasting away within 90 minutes or so of first opening the box.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The Soviet units of maneuver are divisions, as are most NATO units, along with a few brigades and regiments. Each full game turn represents two days.&#10;&#10;The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the western portion of Germany and its environs in the late 1970s. There are 280 unit counters in the game, most of which represent combat formations. Others are also provided as informational markers and memory aids.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

10302,,"Camouflage is a card game from 1918. It consists of a deck of 56 cards. There are five cards each of nine different weapons of war: Airplane Gun, Tank, Howitzer, Mortar, Field Gun, Machine Gun, Rifle, Revolver and Bomb (hand grenade). There are 11 Camouflage cards, showing a camouflage pattern.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt one card. The first player is then dealt another card. If he is dealt a Camouflage card, he does not spin and play passes to the left. Otherwise, he uses the spinner, which has six results: 1, 2 and 3 places to the left and to the right. That player is the target. If that player's stack does not have a Camouflage card on top, the spinning player takes the whole stack. Either way, play passes to the left (dealing a card then using the spinner).&#10;&#10;If a player is dealt a Howitzer card, he takes all unprotected stacks from all other players. The player with the most cards when the deck runs out wins the hand and gets 10 points. The winner of the game is the first to reach 50 points.&#10;&#10;"

10314,,"Players sit on opposite sides of the playing board, with scoring columns in the lower right corner. Each player takes 27 regular chips (one will use the pink side while the other will use the orange side), 2 double chips and 1 stop chip. Each player puts all his chips into the holder and takes 3 scoring pegs in his color. The scoring pegs allow tracking scores from zero to 999.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, players alternate putting one chip of their color into any of the 4 center holes of the board until all 4 holes are filled. The first player then puts one chip on the board so his chip traps one of his opponent's chips. Trapping is custodial, as in Hnefetafl or Othello/Reversi, in any of the eight directions from the just-placed chip. Once a player traps an opponent's chip, he turns it over to his own color. Players score 1 point for each chip in the new row which has been formed (including the just-played chip and the own-color cap chips). Players may trap multiple chips at once or chips in multiple rows.&#10;&#10;Once a double chip is on the board, any row which contains it is worth double (for either player). If there are multiple double chips involved, they're added together before applying the multiplication (thus 3 double chips is sextuple score, 4 double chips is octuple score).&#10;&#10;If an opponent turns over a player's stop chip, this prevents the trapped chips in that row from turning over and voids the opponent's score for that row.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all holes on the board are filled. At the end of the game, each player adds one point for each chip of his color remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

10348,,(from the rules:)&#10;&#10;Second Front Now is a wargame simulating a hypothetical Allied invasion of France in September 1943.  The design combines factual historical detail with educated guesswork to produce an alternative history simulation covering the period from D-Day+1 to D-Day+80.&#10;&#10;The game uses a system similar to that used for their D-Day (historical) and Sea Lion games.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Command magazine #44 (Aug 1997)&#10;&#10;

Each pirate sails his ship around the game board recovering treasure chests which contain varying amounts of gold. The game ends when a pirate with at least one treasure chest sails across the finish line. That pirate gets a bonus for finishing first but does not automatically win the game. The winner is the pirate with the most gold. The decision to end the game is a risky one and the game remains exciting right up to the last move when all the pirates reveal how much treasure they have recovered and the winner is determined. In this 'nautical' game, each pirate must 'sail' his ship to where the treasure chests are. Each pirate chooses the direction to sail his ship on the hexagonal board and which treasures to go after. How many spaces he can move in each direction depends upon the direction the wind is blowing. He can sail more spaces if he goes with the wind and less if he sails on an angle into the wind. Since the direction of the wind changes according to the roll of the dice, and is somewhat predictable, a good part of the strategy of the game is learning how to use the wind in order to sail your ship to where the treasure chests are. No special prior knowledge of sailing is needed.&#10;&#10;"

A play is registered after each down or when a team scores.&#10;&#10;From scrimmage, players line up their formations. The offensive team lines up first and the ball is placed on top of the Center. The first down marker is placed 10 yards forward. On his turn, the offensive player gets three moves with which he can move one man three spaces, one man two spaces and another one space or three men one space each. The defensive player makes his three moves after the offensive player. Once the defensive player has made his three moves, the offensive player moves once again. Play continues until the ball carrier is tackled, a team scores or an incomplete pass is thrown. In order to tackle the ball carrier, the defensive player must land one of his men on the square occupied by the ball carrier. Dice rolls are used to resolve passing.&#10;&#10;The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Description from rulebook&#10;The N.F.L.

Stones threaten towers - whichever color presents the greatest threat to a tower controls it.  Towers weaken stones.  The board is scored after each player's turn. Once placed on the board, a tower changes ownership back and forth as players try to gain control of it.  The beginning of the game is very open, the midgame very strategic and challenging, the endgame is often a &quot;grab&quot; for the final tower.&#10;&#10;More games can be played with the components of this game.
