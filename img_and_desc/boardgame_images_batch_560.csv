It will take strategy, skill, and a fair amount of luck to make it to the treasure. Choose your equipment well for it may be the difference between untold wealth and leaving empty handed. However, the real question isn't if you can make it to the treasure but if you can make it back out.&#10;&#10;Echo Dungeon is a light PnP dungeon crawler. Where the objective is to make it to the Treasure Room and back to the Entrance Stairs first. The only drawback is that most of rooms have traps that are trying to prevent you from doing so. This is achieved by placing randomly picked tiles as you make your way through the dungeon.&#10;&#10;This game can be played with 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;"

136858,,"Smile and Like It is a family-friendly card game for 3 - 8 players with a unique twist.  On your turn, play a card and do what it says, simple as that.  Generally the card will instruct you to claim chips (some face up, some face down, all of which have smiley faces of differing levels of happiness on one side) from the center pot, trade chips you've already collected with other players, and so on.&#10;&#10;Here's the twist: you don't automatically get to draw a card at the end of your turn.  Instead, you have to claim a special &quot;draw&quot; chip (differently colored than all the other chips in the pot) and have it remain in your score pile until your next turn, at which point you can replenish your hand of cards... but that's all you can do on that turn.  Of course, there aren't enough draw chips in the pot for everyone.&#10;&#10;So the tension builds: how long do you dare wait to take the draw chip?  If you run out of cards, you lose chips from your pot to the players seated on either side of you... but if you happen to have a draw chip in your score pile at the end of the game, you take a massive penalty to your final score.&#10;&#10;The game comes with three unique methods of scoring right in the box.  One scoring system simply gives more points for happier smiley faces (very family friendly), one scores points for sets of different types of smileys (a bit more strategic, but still family friendly), and one uses patterns of smileys printed right on the cards, giving the players another option on how to play a card: playing it as a scoring card by spending the specific pattern of smileys in the score pile (introducing a hand management aspect to the game suitable for more hardcore gamers).&#10;&#10;All in all, Smile and Like It is a game that is simple to learn and play, and yet difficult to master in any of its incarnations, making it a game you'll come back to again and again.&#10;&#10;"

Willi, a reporter, is traveling around the world and takes the players with him to tell them about the wonders of the world.&#10;&#10;Aim of the game: All players try to reach the wonders depicted on their cards with the balloons on the game board. Whoever is first to reach five of his/her wonders and takes a picture of them wins the game.&#10;&#10;Setup: Each of the five balloon pieces is put on the corresponding starting point of the board. Each player gets three Willi chips, three compasses and three pips to go with the compasses. The cards are shuffled and each player gets a hand of five cards. Players only see their own cards. The remaining cards form the draw deck.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in several rounds, and each round consists of several legs: rolling the colour die to select a balloon for the round (all players move the same balloon during a round), discarding a card and drawing a new one (optional), choosing directions by marking them with the pip on their compasses, and moving the balloons on the board according to the directions on the compasses. If the balloon lands on a space that shows a wonder that is depicted on a player's card, he/she &quot;takes a picture&quot; (says &quot;Click!&quot; and reads the information about the wonder from his/her card) and draws a new card.&#10;&#10;Balloon movement in more detail: Balloon movement is done in three stages per round. First, the start player chooses one of his/her three compasses, then the next player etc. until all players have resolved all their three compasses. A player may choose not to move the balloon if they don't want to use a particular direction on one of their compasses, but they may not use that compass again in the same round.&#10;Spaces occupied by another balloon or a Willi chip (put on a space that the balloon leaves) are skipped. If a balloon reaches the edge of the board in north or south direction, no further movement in that direction is possible; the eastern and western edges of the map allow crossing over to the other side.&#10;&#10;"
