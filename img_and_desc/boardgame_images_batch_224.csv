The game covers the court conflicts and intriques in anticipation of the old King's demise. In a fragile monarchy, each member of the court will scheme to achieve as much influence on the coming succession as possible. And if victory seems impossible, it might be time to plan your revenge.&#10;&#10;There are seven unique characters in the game, each with its own special abilities and victory conditions. The King can be played by a Game Master but this is not mandatory, though reccomended. More players can act the roles of minor character, roleplaying the effects of the various cards being played.

During the game, each player will receive money and intrique cards and use these to increase their favor with the king, make alliances with other player or further their own goals. But as each player has a unique victory condition, alliances never lasts long in the court of the king. There are three distinct phases in the game, in the Audience phase ressources are distributed, in the Diplomacy phase off-table diplomacy occurs and finally the Council Phase is where players will make and discuss petitions. There is also a heavy emphasis on roleplaying, and each card and ability is recommended to be acted out by the players, as the King can grant Favor to those who perform particularly dramatic or cunning.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    31-page Rulebook&#10;    Seven Player Portfolios&#10;    Royal Bag of Coin&#10;    Coins of the Realm&#10;    200 cards divided into six different types&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each version game puts the players in the role of powerful mages and alchemists, who are trying to find a cure to the strange and sudden illness that stroke the king of Astoria. The material included (four glass flasks, 60 shining gems in six colors, 66 cards) is used differently, depending on the game played.&#10;&#10;The Combination Version is team-played. By placing gems, players put in place the components that will make them able to produce one of many different magic components. Those components will be used as reagents in the cure.&#10;&#10;The players use alchemy powers to prevent the opposing team from putting their reagents in play, or to speed up their own production, in order to produce the best cure for the king and be rewarded accordingly. The game ends as soon as one category of gems is depleted, so it is important to delay the end of the game if your team hasn't found the best cure yet.&#10;&#10;The other side of the board presents a completely different game named the &quot;Epic Version&quot;, that includes more diplomacy and roleplaying features.&#10;&#10;Players are powerful mages trying to save the city of Astoria from three disasters : a barbarian invasion, a revolt, and the wrath of a powerful dragon. They develop their powers by creating magic items and putting them in play. Magic items are from six different magic sources, and each source can be used for a different effect on the city. The players use those magical forces to fight off the barbarians and defend the city from the besieging forces. The barbarian hordes will also be reinforced by war chiefs and sorcerers that will add to the pressure on the city.&#10;&#10;The players objective is still to find a cure to the illness of the king of Astoria. But some of the mages are also traitors, trying to lead the king to his final rest and give victory to one of the enemies of Astoria. Players have to watch each other, and may accuse another mage of treachery. They also have to keep an eye for the king's health, for if he dies, everything will be lost for the defenders.&#10;&#10;The game has different endings : the king can die, or can be saved. Or the city may fall to the hands of one of the enemies of Astoria. If one of the enemy factions comes to its maximal force, the game immediately ends with the victory of this faction (and, possibly, the victory of the traitor that was secretly supporting it!).&#10;&#10;Both the Combination and the Epic Versions use a scoring method that makes it possible for players to play the game in competition and tournaments.&#10;&#10;"

This is a&#10;game were everybody plays equally - not where one player controls the bad guys and everybody&#10;responds/submits to his decisions. Each player controls his own little band of misfits AND controls&#10;the critters that another player will encounter. Each player is someone else's nemesis.&#10;All encounter and miscellaneous event rolls are done in the open, and are a surprise for everybody&#10;to enjoy. The whole point of this little endeavor is for everybody to have fun, so it helps&#10;if you don't take things too seriously. These rules are not intended as an overly detailed, exhaustive&#10;study in the complexities of subterranean armored combat. Nor will they require you&#10;to undertake a prolonged course of study in order to properly equip and prepare your party for&#10;eventual world domination.&#10;&quot;Elegance in Simplicity&quot; is the rule, even when it comes to brawling in the dark recesses of the&#10;dungeons. Hopefully you will find DungeonCrawl to be reasonably quick and reasonably fun.&#10;Enjoy.&#10;All players will begin the game with essentially equal parties. In the standard game, parties are&#10;composed of 1 fighter, 1 archer, 1 cleric, 1 thief, and 1 mage. For more advanced games, players&#10;may customize their party to suit their playing style. All players have roughly the same goal&#10;&ndash; get their party out alive with as much loot as possible. In the basic game, the winner is determined&#10;by the player with the most loot at the end. More advanced games have differing goals,&#10;or specific objectives to be accomplished in order to claim victory.&#10;But it all boils down to:&#10;Kill Critters, Get Goodies; try to get out alive so you can brag about it.&#10;&#10;"

Two maps cover Europe and North Africa from Caucasus to Ireland and from Sweden to Egypt. 780 counters personify land and naval units as well as every corps-commanding leader of that time. The combat units are army corps and fleets, and sometimes entire armies. Their content varies with the player&rsquo;s will and the contingencies of that era; Guard, line infantry, Elite, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, militia, Cossacks, and so on. The game turns are season-based and interactive, including a variable number of impulses. A budget phase occurs every fall.&#10;&#10;The game can involve two players (one French and one anti-French), or five players (France, Great-Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria), or even seven players (Spain and the Ottoman Empire have their own player). Of course, victory conditions vary accordingly.&#10;&#10;The operational part of the game points out the importance of leadership and line of communication; attrition can be very high. Evasive actions and interceptions lead to the deployment of armies followed by battle. Battle occurs in the same hex; troop quality, tactical choices and leader values are taken into account in the issue of the battle.&#10;&#10;At the strategic level, the players are responsible for their unit&rsquo;s production and maintenance. Diplomacy is the key point in creating alliances with other powers, major or minor. Moreover, many random events improve the Napoleonic flavor of that time.&#10;&#10;The overall purpose of the Grand Empire is to provide a strategic Napoleonic game that takes into account historical, military and diplomatic sights, and that can be played in a short period of time (one year is four turns and can be played in two hours) with a reasonable amount of rules.&#10;&#10;Contents :&#10; * Two maps&#10; * 3 countersheets (260 double sided counters each).&#10; * one rulebook and one scenarios booklet.&#10; * 2 dice.&#10; * Tables and charts&#10;&#10;"

The board, a 9x9 super grid of 3x3 mini grids, is simple enough to be drawn by hand.  There are two major components of play: a mapping mechanism and a system of glyphs, or patterns of orthogonally adjacent squares.  The mapping mechanism works as follows.  Your last move points to the mini grid in which your next move must be made.  For example, if your last move was in the upper left corner of a mini grid, then your next move must be made somewhere in the upper left mini grid.  The glyph system works as follows.  There are 19 named glyphs of various sizes from 1 to 9 orthogonally adjacent squares.  Glyphs that you form during play are worth points.  The majority of points scored in a mini grid wins the mini grid.  The winner of the majority of mini grids wins the game.&#10;&#10;For the complete rules to Scribe, see http://marksteeregames.com/&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Super Duper Games&#10;&#10;&#10;"
