They were intended to be used for group play and class exercises in ways that would be fun for children as well as sound in terms of pedagogy.&#10;&#10;The deck is made up of 56 cards, each featuring a fraction with a denominator between 2 and 12. On 15 of the cards, the numerator is a &quot;?&quot;, which can stand for any number less than the denominator.&#10;&#10;The rules booklet describes four group games and 13 class exercises. In the first game, for instance, the cards are dealt equally among the players, with any odd cards placed face up on the table. Play proceeds with each player turning over one card and by combining it with any other face-up cards, achieve a whole number. If successful, all the cards used are gathered up, and the player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

The rules booklet describes a Primary Exercise for first-year students, three Group Games and four Class Exercises.&#10;&#10;In Group Game 2, for instance, one of each vowel is placed face up on the table, and the rest of the vowel cards are distributed randomly to the players and also placed face up. The rest of the cards are distributed face down as equally as possible. Each player draws a hand of five consonants, and then in turn try to form words using cards in hand and vowels on table. Players may also play cards from hand that add to existing words and make new, longer ones. The first player to empty his hand wins.&#10;&#10;The rule booklet concludes with rules for using this deck to play Niloe, a word game published separately by Cincinnati predecessor Fireside Game Co. in 1896.&#10;&#10;"

These are games which fit on a A5 card. #0020 is 'Maurice vs. Niek', and was published for the 40 year anniversary.&#10;&#10;This game is an area enclosure game by Martyn F for 2-4 players. Each player controls 3 committee members on a 12x9 board. Each turn, a player moves one of his committee members in a straight line, and then places two blocking pieces (Ducosim members) on a spot where two of his committee members could move to. A player controls an enclosed area if he has the only committee member there.&#10;The person with the most enclosed squares (most are worth 1, some 11) wins the game when a player can take no more moves.&#10;&#10;"

You are supposed to assume the role of the militant feudal and to put a halt to the hostile lords&rsquo; encroachments on the throne of the fairy kingdom. Mercenaries will help you: they are ready to spill their blood on the battlefield for a pretty penny and promises of glory.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; vaguely resembles &ldquo;Battles of magicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;Memoir&rsquo;44&rdquo;. Lords&rsquo; castles are located on both sides of the game-board. Players can recruit troops and build fortifications there. The battlefield itself is two-sided and it contains special structures, giving bonuses to players who occupy these locations.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game, each player chooses one of the four mercenary factions, which will be his army. Characters of each faction are represented by the cards. They have their own  particularities, strengths and weaknesses. A lot of soldiers have not only ordinary characteristics such as velocity, attack and defence, but also some special abilities (which are very often unique for the army) that can be used during the game.&#10;&#10;The confrontation between barons is very swift. Having recruited troops from hand, a player can move forward and attack. As soldiers can move only forward, so five &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; appear on the battlefield where the major battles occur. But each player can activate only five units during his or her turn, and some characters can change the lines they move along. All these points transform simple mechanics into an interesting tactical puzzle. The more the player is experienced, the more difficult is to solve this puzzle. Moreover, spells, able to change course of action, are available for each player. Soldiers also can be sent to the Catacombs in the hope of finding treasures hidden there.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win: to help your mercenaries to end up beyond the edge of your adversary&rsquo;s field or to get 20 points for having struck adversary&rsquo;s troops and having destroyed his structures.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Royal Defense&rdquo; is a duel strategy game with low learning curve. Its rules are easy to explain and the game will not take long. Besides, rules also propose different options for three and four players.&#10;&#10;"

Therefore he has invited all Troubadours and Fools around to audition their best show. The winner will become Fool of the Feast and well rewarded.&#10;&#10;Fool of the Feast is a light pocket card game for 2 - 4 players where you try to put on the best show for the King. Only three cards are played in a game round, but with split cards and special actions there is a more complex strategy to explore.&#10;&#10;The second time a players show gets the king&rsquo;s favour - that player wins. A show consist of three rounds. Each round a card is played. First the entertainer presentation, then a fist act and lastly a second act. During the game the King reveal what he likes to see - and players now have to use the different card actions to make their show fit the Kings wishes.&#10;&#10;The show with the most points total wins the king&rsquo;s favor that round. The crown icons on a card is basic points you will score for act. So more crowns means a better act. This will be modified by what themes the king like and don't like. So if the king laughs at your rivals &quot;juggling monk&quot; - you might need to mess that show up.&#10;&#10;The goal is to become the king&rsquo;s fool - so basically everyone wins.&#10;&#10;This game was originally a submission for the 18 card contest 2015.

The game features multi-use cards and a time track that determines the players' turn order. The player whose ice cream truck is furthest back on the road goes next and may choose from several actions on their turn: stocking up on new treats, playing music over the loudspeaker to attract business, or passing out treats to fulfill customer desires. Every choice costs time and forces players to move ahead on the road track. Once a player is no longer in the rear of the pack, their turn ends until they find themselves lagging behind again.&#10;&#10;In addition to gaining loyalty points from happy customers, players can gain bonus treats in their permanent supply so that they can meet demand a little easier. Throughout the game, players also fight to earn the right to take over several of the different territories that make summer great: the beach, the pool, the park, and the ballfield.&#10;&#10;"

Each card played must share an emblem with the previous card (some cards have 2 emblems and either can be matched). In an ideal world, you want to utilise symbols that are not your own role as when it comes to apportioning blame (Accusation), the numbers of your cards vs the other person you have accused of being to blame will be counted.  &#10; Accusation is achieved by pointing your finger very vehemently at the accused player.  Keeping a mental track of what&rsquo;s been played is therefore a really good strategy as looking through the pile is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The player with the most of their own emblem in the pile takes the entire blame pile.
