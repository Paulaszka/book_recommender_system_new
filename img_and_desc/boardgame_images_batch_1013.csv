While the forces of heaven try to influence for good, the demonic fallen angels strive to draw the soul into darkness and despair. In the realm of the spirital world, mighty angel warriors try to hold their positions against onstorming demons and tormentors, by seeking to break their defenses, or by taking control of valuable crystals and living water fountains to slowly turn the tide of war to their advantage. The mighty and mysterious 6-winged seraphs summon new angels to gain a foothold on the enemy&acute;s flank. Meanwhile the archangels, God&acute;s chosen messengers, move like lightning over the battlefield, commanding their forces, and bringing fear to the hosts of evil. The archdemons, false gods of the ancient world, no less cunning, rise up to meet them in battle. They all know the victory belongs to the wisest leader. Are you that leader?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Take control of the forces of good or the hordes of evil. Command mighty seraphs or fierce tormentors. Each player begins with a starting deck customized by a unique general - either an archangel or archdemon. Each turn, you will use your Command markers to move troops or initiate battles and then use the cards in your hand to modify those movements or battles - or build your turn around an epic Tactics card that provides even more value! You can use your resources to deploy more units, increase your handsize, or gain more Command markers! At the end of your turn, you&rsquo;ll gain more resources if you control certain Areas - or even 1 Soul Point if you control the Human Soul. When either the good or evil side has 7 Soul Points - the game is over and the soul has been claimed!&#10;&#10;"

The third king devoted all his energies to the development of the country and set up many enterprises, but the unprecedented heavy taxation caused the people to protest. The fourth king reduced taxes for the benefit of the people, but he failed to produce any results and was ridiculed as an ornament king. The fifth king finally became resentful, and instead of listening to the people, he brought great prosperity to the country by his own means, but he was called a tyrant by the people with whom he colluded, and was forced to leave his throne.&#10;&#10;And the next king is about to be chosen from the candidates.&#10;What do the people want from their next king?&#10;Will they be able to live up to their hopes and show what it takes to be king?&#10;&#10;This is a confrontational, unusual trick-taking game where you have to guess your own subject while trying to sabotage your rival's subject.

The banished Grim Reapers wish nothing but regaining their power, so they assemble secretly, endeavoring to take back their control over the Reaper&rsquo;s Realm through a mysterious sacrificial ritual. However, the assembly room is already penetrated by the Jokers --- the orders of the offerings are disrupted, and the real class of the offerings can&rsquo;t be identified! The clock is ticking, and the right moment for the ritual is about to pass.

Players may start the ritual whenever the number of the character cards on the altar meets the requirements; however, to start the ritual successfully, the combination of the character cards have to be correct, too. That means players may also win the game by cheating their opponents, misleading them to start the ritual with a wrong combination and cause the ritual to fail. When there are 9 character cards on the altar, yet the ritual hasn&rsquo;t been started, the Jokers automatically win the game (they are already in charge of the Reaper&rsquo;s Realm, after

The goal is to clear all their hands of all cards before the game ends. If any player is left holding a card at the end of the game, they all lose.&#10;&#10;The game has a deck of 48 cards numbered 1-48. The cards are in sections each with their own theme, 1-9 (Kitakuba), 10-19 (butterflies), 20-29 (eyeglasses), 30-39 (yokai), 40-48 (fanzines).&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled and seven cards are dealt out face-down to each player. Players sort their hand and then choose a hand card, placing it face-down. Once everyone has chosen, they reveal their card, and the lowest card is placed first in the centre (onto an imaginary zero), and then the next card and so on (similar to Take 5. Cards are played into a pile, and lower cards are hidden and not to be examined later.&#10;&#10;Then each player draws a card so their hand is back to seven, and play continues in the same way.&#10;&#10;At any point, even at the start, a player can call for a trade, and all players pass a card to the left. Successive trades can be made in the same round, but only six trades are allowed in the whole game. A marker is moved along a track on the rear of the game box to count the trades.&#10;&#10;Discussion is allowed in the game, but is limited. Players cannot say or imply a specific numbered card, but can talk in general about their cards. For example, 'I have two 20s', or 'I have zero Kitakuba'. In this way, players can work out which cards would be good to trade or keep in hand.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot play a card to the pile legally, the first day of sales ends and the pile is set to one side. Play continues for a second day, starting at zero again. If a player cannot play legally again, day two ends and the players all lose.&#10;&#10;If the players succeed in clearing their entire hands before day two ends, they all win.&#10;&#10;(Note: this game was published in Japan in 2016, before The Mind in 2018).&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

The games base mode uses classic monopoly mechanics and is completely redesigned and re-themed around Paradise culture, history and community. The process of whittling down what would be represented from the town involved hundreds of community members suggesting and voting online what should be included. The result is a rich and well-rounded portrayal of our little town. My main purpose in the design of the game was for it to really give someone that feeling of home when they play it, whether you are from there or not. Nearly every person who was in Paradise that day lost everything. Not only their homes, pets and even family members, but they lost their community. The town was completely changed forever in a matter of hours. My intent is to capture the spirit of Paradise that so many love, cherish and miss dearly.&#10;&#10;I am not a game developer, by any means. I just had an idea, shortly after the fire, to create this game to commemorate the town. Since that idea I have learned many things and the idea has grown into a beautifully designed and well thought out game. I am currently in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign and fully expect to reach my funding goal so I can produce 3000 games. 100% of the net-profits from my company sales of the games and merchandise will be donated back to non-profits aimed at immediate rebuilding projects for lower income residents of Paradise. I intend to represent my town and help in any way I can.&#10;&#10;The game features fun, vibrant and colorful artwork and design by Traci Van Wagoner and Kurt Keller of Imagine That! Design in New York. They have done an amazing job with conveying the detail and nuance I wanted in every illustration and design. All of the metal game miniatures are custom designed by the very talented 3D sculptor, Chad Hoverter, and represent somethng special and unique to Paradise. Even the old &quot;houses and hotels&quot; are now Miner's Tents and Log Cabins, one of the many references to the very prominent gold rush history of the area. All of the &quot;Property&quot; cards contain a short story or description about the landmark or place they contain. Included is a full color information booklet with extended versions of the stories. For some playing that weren't locals or for kids who may not know all the history of their town the game serves as a fun learning experience of the towns culture and beginnings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

After making the move, the monster figure can be lifted to see the die. If the top face is showing a closed eye picture, this means the monster has fallen asleep and the player&rsquo;s turn is over. If the die is showing an open eye picture, the player can perform an action.&#10;&#10;After finishing the monster turn, the players then take a turn as elves, trying to find colored socks in chests and cabinets on the game board. If a matching pair of socks is collected, elves put them on their hands, feet and ears &ndash; and that&rsquo;s really hard work!&#10;&#10;The game ends when any one player has collected three pairs of socks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The first player to have three victory points provided by hatched dragons wins.&#10;&#10;The heroes are usually spending their time in the inn, waiting for adventure. They wait until all four are present in the party - fighter, thief, mage and priest. These days there is a high demand for captured dragons so then they go to the dungeon and return with a captured dragon egg (well they do their best to choose an egg with a dragon inside but sometimes they pick the wrong one containing something worthless like a giant snake or an ostrych). This is the most noble and heroic way to acquire a dragon egg. Real heroes do it this way.&#10;&#10;There are some players with less honor who take an easier approach. An approach that includes stealth and shady figures in cloaks. Those players may simply steal eggs from other players. (Actually this happens pretty often) You may say that this is not that heroic and noble but the result is the same and the dragon egg is as good as one that the heroes could get from a long and exhausting adventure.&#10;&#10;The acquired egg still needs to hatch. If you have the right cards - two mages - you can hatch the egg. This is a very delicate process where the mages have to use their magic very carefully so that the creature inside the egg is not hurt. (but usually they just blast it with fireballs) Hatched dragons give victory points and the player who first has three wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
