356525,,"Nambarz is a game of mental arithmetic and strategy for adults and children, age 7 and up. Played by anywhere from 2 to 12 players at once, either as individuals or in teams, it is an educational game which promotes the practice of mental arithmetic, as well as strategic thinking, while having fun.&#10;&#10;It does not require complex math exercises. The idea is to perform combinations of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) using numbers from 1 to 10. The goal of the game is that a player be the first to discard all of his or her cards. The sooner a player finishes, the better his or her ranking and the more points received.&#10;&#10;There are two possible means of getting rid of cards : either by finding a card that matches the card which is face up in the card pile (that is, sharing the same face number or picture), or by doing mental math (which is not limited to a certain number of cards or number of mathematical operations). The latter allows a player to eliminate several cards at once.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s challenge is to find mathematical combinations that allow the elimination of a maximum number of cards at one time. It must be kept in mind that strategy is required, both in the choice of cards and in the order of the mathematical operations performed, in order to create an advantage in the next round or for a teammate&rsquo;s next play.&#10;&#10;Four types of wildcards are included to make game strategy even more challenging and exciting. The variations that are built into the game allow players to advance gradually from beginners to seasoned players, depending on the number of wildcards that are used.&#10;&#10;"

Every day the Committee of Public Safety carts dozens of aristocrats and royalists to the hungry guillotines. But a mysterious hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, has been rescuing dozens of condemned Frenchmen and their families, whisking them away to the safety of England. Nobody seems to know who he is, for he and his League of supporters are masters of cunning and disguise. But can they continue to outwit agent Chauvelin and his guards who are determined to stop them?&#10;&#10;Based on the novels of Baroness Orczy, this card game sets each player a secret identity and a different win condition. The Scarlet Pimpernel and his League try to rescue as many prisoners as possible, against Chauvelin and his agents for the Committee for Public Safety who try to execute the condemned. Depending on the player count, there may also be a corrupt guard, out to make as much bribe money as possible, or a tricoteuse (knitting woman) who simply aims to be near the heart of the violence.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a maximum of seven rounds, corresponding to seven prisoners to be rescued, each with unique rule variations so that no two rounds are the same. Within each round, players must simultaneously place face-down cards containing coins, pimpernel flowers or swords at one of two potential rescue locations. Once all cards have been played, the location with the most bribe money (coins) is where the rescue attempt takes place, and at that site the fate of the prisoner depends on whether there are more swords (executed) or flowers (rescued). Players must use bluff and cunning to deduce the identities of the other players, then work with their allies to swing the outcomes to their favour.&#10;&#10;"

Just like partners you have to get your pawns from the home area to the target as fast as possible. Pawns are moved clockwise along the track according to the value of the card played, unless the card allows you to do something else (move backwards, split the value, swap spaces, put another pawn into play, etc.) Players are dealt 4 cards, and then have to swap one of the cards with their opponent (instead of their partner). The winner is the player who first get all his pawns (two set of three) placed in the target area.&#10;&#10;Differences from the original edition include:&#10;1) You do not play as a pair, but only 1-vs-1&#10;2) You swap a card with your opponent instead of your partner. This is very different, since your choice directly influence what your opponent can do, and your opponent also knows one of your cards.&#10;3) You have to get 2 sets of 3 pawns around the track (instead of one set of 4 pawns.&#10;4) Many of the cards have changed, now the highest card is 10 instead of a 14, and there are new abilities on some of the cards.&#10;5) The track is a bit smaller, 40 space around instead of 56 spaces.&#10;&#10;"

The animal dice indicates which animal counter can move and how many game board tiles it can go forward.

A 4x8x4 playing field.  Requires two sets of chess pieces, that even means two kings and two queens.  Each 3D row has alternating colors.  It is ideal to play facing each other along the long span of the board.  The game is intended to naturally extend the 2D-Chess game into 3D.&#10;&#10;The game was inspired by the 3D chess and checker boards depicted on Star Trek.  A 18-page booklet was published in 1970 entitled &quot;The Complete Rules of Three Dimensional Chess&quot;.&#10;&#10;All aspects of 2D-Chess are retained and extended into 3D, even some things you would not expect like &quot;Castling&quot; and &quot;En Passant&quot;.  However, there is one rule that remains ever unpopular and may seem counterintuitive.  'The Change in Distance Rule' (CID) It states that all diagonal or L-Shaped moves must advance or retreat to or from the opponent.  Yes, players do find it naturally intuitive to move on side-diagonals. But with the rule in place: The Rook nearly stays above the Knight in Piece-Power. Bishops &amp; Knights cannot just move around on their Back-Rank. This eliminates Extra Diagonal 3D King running room and expect a similar game length to regular chess.&#10;&#10;Two-Kings?: The rules were simplified by Robert Jr.  It was very unpopular to have to checkmate both kings.  Therefore, a King-fork, and/or either King being Checkmated wins.&#10;&#10;"

Cards show a colored item, e.g., a red ice cream spoon or a purple scarf.

The game is compatible for 2 to 5 players.

The game lasts, at a minimum, long enough for each player to be dealer. For longer games, each player may be dealer multiple times. After the final round, the player with the most accumulated points is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game is composed of 46 game cards. These cards are divided into three suits: HUMAN, DWARF, and DARK ELF, and one wildcard. Each suit is made up of fifteen different cards, each card having a distinct value, indicated by both the number in the top left and bottom right corners of the card. A card&rsquo;s value is akin to its strength or power. If two cards share the same suit, the card with a higher value will beat the card with a lower value, thus winning the trick (or turn).&#10;&#10;Each round consists of a series of 7 turns for each player, called tricks. Every trick, each player will play one card from their hand face up into the middle. One player will lead (that is, play the first card of the trick), and the others will follow in clockwise order. Based on the cards played, one player will be said to win the trick.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
