Political Factions tear the otherwise stable American political system into two deeply divided camps.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The President (Eagle Faction) under the Homeland Defense Amendment has moved to the Cheyenne Mountain complex in Colorado just outside of Denver, in order to counter what he called the growing internal threats to the American way of Life. He is isolationist and seeks to remain beyond a second term. He is supported by the Air Force.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The Congress (Flag Faction) wants to control what they see as the unchecked power of a Demagogue determined to seize total control. They are supporting greater State autonomy but are international in their economic interest. They are supported by the Navy. Eventually, the thunderclouds of civil war once again threaten to appear over the skies over America.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game is played on an area movement map of the continental United States. There are 22 areas and 19 cities marked on the mapsheet. &quot;The First player to gain control of THIRTEEN cities (two of which must be Denver and D.C.) and FIFTEEN areas is declared the winner.&quot;&#10;&#10;A Political Alignment Index (PAI) is used to determine which side has control of these spaces on the mapsheet. The side with an advantage on the PAI has an easier time establishing political control over areas and cities, while the other side has an easier time gaining military support.&#10;&#10;"

Rather, we have aimed at producing a more colourful and attractive package, hopefully easier to use and improving the feel of being at a speedway meet.&#10;&#10;The old plastic boards have gone in favour of a card version; this was done to enable us to produce a colour depiction of a speedway stadium. We hope you approve. If you find the board a little thin, try pasting the two halves onto some thicker card; I personally have not found the need and I believe the card track provided actually lies flat better than the old colour plastic versions.&#10;&#10;"

To give an example of one such ruleset, the simplest version of Angelspa&szlig; from Selecta Spielzeug has players load the fishing area with the 18 magnetic fish. Players then take turns fishing with the rod, with each player having two chances to catch a fish and reel it out of the box, before the next player takes a turn. The game ends once all the fish have been caught, and the player with the longest line of fish wins.&#10;&#10;Another version of Angelspa&szlig; from slightly older players brings a die into play. On a turn, a player rolls the die before fishing. If she rolls a color, she tries to catch a fish of that color while looking in the box. Catch an &quot;out of season&quot; color, and you have to throw the fish back. Roll a starfish, and you choose the color; roll an octopus, and you toss one fish held by an opponent back in the sea; roll a boot, and your turn gets booted! The first player to collect five fish wins.&#10;&#10;"

This is a statistic that operates under the revolutionary and controversial theorem that a pitchers value comes from his strikeouts, walks, and home runs allowed (because these are the only events over which the pitcher has total control).&#10;&#10;Each at bat starts on the pitchers card and while one of the outcomes from above (K, BB or HR) may come into play each batter has the final say.  The game includes split LH/RH ratings for all pitchers and hitters with at least 40 BF/AB against each side. Defensive plays such as range plays and errors are interwoven into the game so as to make it seamless.  All action comes from the players cards so outside chart lookups to determine the outcome of at bats are a thing of the past.&#10;Hitters are not left out as they are rated for where they actually hit the ball in the year represented.  Base running, stealing and bunting can be handled by the game engine for the solitaire player as well.&#10;&#10;Ballparks play a big part in IP.  Now each park will have its own card (look just like a hitter card)  that is referenced during game play.  Ballparks will be represented on more than just HRs allowed.  All hits, strikeouts and walks will be affected by the place a game is being played.  Just by looking at the ballpark cards you will see that the Astrodome will yield few HR chances while Coors Field will earn its rep as the launching pad.&#10;These ballpark cards have been seamlessly added to the game as well by not requiring any outside lookups.  They have also give the opportunity to add rare plays and the &quot;trying to stretch&quot; hits in the game.&#10;&#10;We have completed a sample game run through that shows how the game plays along with pictures to guide you the IP game play.  It can be found at http://forums.delphiforums.com/ISGF/messages?msg=214.1 .&#10;&#10;IP takes a unique approach to simulating the game of baseball.  From where you start with the pitchers card to how the defense gets involved the game just feels right.  So forget the 50/50 setup, forget the chart lookups and step inside the game of baseball with Inside Pitch.&#10;&#10;"
