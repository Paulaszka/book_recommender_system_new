Each player controls a faction of revolutionaries&mdash;Workers, Students, Neighbors, or Prisoners&mdash;fighting against the State in the streets of a city that change with each game. Build barricades, clash with riot cops, occupy districts, loot shopping centers, and liberate the city before time runs out and the military arrives! Bloc by Bloc features hidden agendas, deep strategy, area control, asymmetrical player abilities, and a special method for randomly generating billions of unique city layouts. Bloc by Bloc 2nd edition features brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!&#10;&#10;The game lasts up to 10 rounds. Each round is 1 night and each night has 2 phases. During the Nighttime phase, each player takes a turn: 3-5 actions followed by a police response that is controlled by the Police Ops deck and the level of Police Morale. Each player starts with 2 blocs in the city and can add more throughout the game. On a player's turn, they roll dice and take one action (such as looting, occupying, attacking, or barricading) for each die rolled with 1+ of their blocs. Players may use loot cards to enhance their actions. After all factions have taken their turns, the Sunrise phase begins, which is when police go on the attack and factions have a chance to liberate districts.&#10;&#10;The police and the State are the common enemies of all factions. Factions must build occupations in all of their own districts for the social insurrection to be successful. However, each faction also has its own secret agenda with a set of specific tasks that faction must complete in order to win the game. The majority of factions will have Social Agendas and they must cooperate to win the game together. But some factions may have Vanguardist or Nihilist Agendas that secretly pit them against the social insurrection. These factions can only win the game alone!&#10;&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition features a brand new art, streamlined gameplay, improved components and new objectives for the insurrection!&#10;&#10;"

Instead it uses tiles in 4 different suit colors (red, green, yellow, blue). In each suit color there are tiles valued 1 to 9 in sizes that vary by value. The breakdown of tile sizes are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All 1,2,3 value tiles are 4 squares in length&#10;     All 4,5,6,7 value tiles are 3 squares in length&#10;     All 8,9 value tiles are 2 squares in length&#10;&#10;&#10;At the start of the game and in turn order, each player will draw a hand of 4 scoring cards from a deck of 9 and choose one to keep. When each player has a single scoring card, all unchosen cards are returned to the box unrevealed. Each player will then take a turn blindly drawing 3 tiles from the bag of 36. These tiles are kept secret and are placed behind their player blind. The drawing phase continues in this manner until the bag is empty. Each player is then given one basket tile, which has 4 empty spaces on it where acquired fruit tokens may be placed. On the table is a 10x10 game board with fruit, basket, and insect symbols printed on it.&#10;&#10;Tricks are played using the tiles each player has drawn. The game uses standard &quot;must follow&quot; trick-taking rules with the trump suit always being the red suit. To begin a trick, the lead player places one of their tiles onto the game board. In turn order, each other player must follow suit by playing a tile of the same color to the board. If a player can not follow suit they may place any color tile they would like. When placing a tile it must be orthogonally adjacent to a previously placed tile. Anytime a player covers a fruit symbol on the board, a token of that type is taken from the supply and placed in the middle of the table. If covering a basket or insect symbol a player receives immediately receives it. Once all players have placed a tile onto the board the trick's winner is determined:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If a player's has no empty spaces on their basket tile(s), they are not eligible to win the trick.&#10;     If any player couldn't play a tile to the board during the placement phase, they are not eligible to win the trick.&#10;     The player who played the highest value of the lead color or the highest trump is the winner of the trick.&#10;&#10;&#10;The trick's winner will take all fruit tokens placed in the middle of the table and place them into their basket(s). Any fruit that can't be placed in an empty basket space must be returned to the center of the table. The trick winner then leads the next trick. If any player isn't able to play a tile to the board due to unavailable space, that player is skipped and the game proceeds in turn order. It is possible for a trick to be comprised of a single tile.&#10;&#10;Play continues until either one player is out of tiles or no player is able to place any more tiles. When either happens players proceed to scoring. All players score points based on their score card drawn at the beginning of the game. For each insect token a player has in front of them, one of their highest valued fruit is discarded and will not be scored. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

You'll think together to optimize your progression to have a chance to defeat one of the 4 bosses.&#10;&#10;Combats are turn-based. Heroes take action first. They can either use their weapons, use their skills or use a consummable object. Once they all did an action, it's the monsters' turn. Monsters tends to attack the hero holding the defender token. Some of them can choose their target.&#10;&#10;The dungeon is a layout of 6 to 15 cards (at the end of the games). Heroes enter the crypt by turning a card face up (Monsters, chests ...). They resolve the card before deciding to go back to the camp or going deeper in the crypt and therefore turning the next card face up. Once they are at the far end of the dungeon, they can decide to face the boss or the go back to the camp. At the beginning of the game, being a coward is the only option. At some point, you'll have to face your ultimate nemesis. Beat him and you'll win but fail to do so and you'll lose the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Satoyama is the area between arable flatland and the foothills of the mountains (sato &#233;&#135;&#140; means village, and yama &#229;&#177;&#177; means hill).&#10;&#10;In the game, players are placing cards in a pyramid, representing the food chain in a Satoyama area. The players' goal is to keep the area healthy by maintaining a good balance between vegetation, herbivores and carnivores.&#10;&#10;The cards show anime-style images of the plants and animals as cute girls. Foreign or alien species must be kept out to allow the native speices to flourish. A good balance must be kept, otherwise the ecology will collapse quickly. If there is too much food, the predators will increase and overload the system. If there is not enough food, the predators will die out.&#10;&#10;Players can win in different ways. By eliminating alien species, they can achieve an aggressive win. By causing the other players' ecosystems to collapse, or eliminating three native species, they get a passive win. By maintaining a system and scoring more points, they gain a judgement win.&#10;&#10;The designer likens the game to Tsume Shogi, which are Shogi puzzles in which a player must force a win or lose immediately. The game is designed to show the fragile nature of ecosystems in Japan.&#10;&#10;The game can be played solitaire. A revised edition was published with extra cards, improved graphic design, added  trivia and a supplementary set of rules by the designer.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Over a series of rounds, players engage in sealed bid auctions to determine turn order and acquire cards from a shared market. When revealed during market setup, Cartographer cards are immediately placed in a dedicated area instead of the market, and replaced with a new card. All other cards must be used immediately: Explorer, Crew, and Vehicle cards are added to build or enhance one of your two expedition teams (discarding any previous card of that type in the team if needed), Patron cards are sold for money (with a bonus if matching your player screen), and Special cards are either played for their effect or sold.&#10;&#10;Accumulating 3 Cartographer cards in this dedicated area triggers an Expedition to the current active mythical location. Players decide which of their teams (if any) to send. Team strength is dynamically recalculated based solely on the expedition's specific requirements. All participating teams earn monetary rewards based on their strength. Players also earn artifact tokens for each participating team, with their value determined by the player's current position on the Initiative Track. The strongest team wins the Expedition card itself. After rewards, every participating team loses one card (chosen by the highest-initiative opponent for the expedition winner).&#10;&#10;After four expeditions, the game ends. Players tally their reputation points from their collected Expedition cards, the value of their artifact tokens, and their remaining money. The player with the highest reputation wins, with position on the Initiative Track breaking any ties.&#10;&#10;"

The first two cards allow players to pass a lolly to another player or to the candy boy in the middle of the table, but only if they are the only one doing that action, so if two players both try to pass a lolly to a third player, they deny each other and keep their lollys. The third card blocks attempts to give you a lolly that round, and the final retrieves one card to be played again on a future round, neither of these are affected by other players choosing the same action.&#10;&#10;When all players empty their hands, players collect their used cards and continue.&#10;&#10;When a player empties their supply of lollipops, they win!
