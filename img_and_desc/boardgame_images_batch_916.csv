Remaining Attack Cards are placed in a draw pile. The attacking pirate chooses a defending pirate and plays an Attack Card. The defender can play a higher matching suit Attack Card, play a no-suit defense card, or accept the attack. If the attack is defended, the attacking player or any other player can launch up to 6 attacks total against the defending player, or with as many cards as the defender has, whichever is fewer.&#10;&#10;Upon a successful attack by any player, the battle ends. The lead attacking pirate may look at two Legend Cards and select one, while the other attacking pirates may only draw one Legend Card. Alternatively, attacking players may choose to draw up to two Attack Cards (as able) or destroy a revealed Legend Card instead. There are different kinds of Legend Cards, and a player may only ever hold one of each type of Legend Card. If ever a player draws a Legend Card matching what they own, that player secretly discards this card to the Legend deck.&#10;&#10;After the battle, all Attack Cards played against the defender will enter the defender's hand regardless of the outcome.  The defender's cards will enter the bottom of the Attack Card deck face-down. The defending pirate will be the attacker in the next attack.&#10;&#10;Between attacks, players may choose to reveal Legend Cards, which, in addition to furthering the win condition, will give them a significant upgrade to their actions and firepower. However, showing a Legend Card opens the possibility that another player will choose to destroy their Legend Card versus collecting one of their own. Knowing when to show a Legend Card and when to rely on your hand is paramount to winning a game of Gunpowder &amp; Gold.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You must have seen a lot: miraculous worlds, battles with dragons, good triumphing over evil... You also must have suspected that dungeons were not designed on their own and dragons did not collect all of those riches they usually guard. That's what we do &mdash; create fabulous lands that would meet your highest expectations! Since there are more and more of you coming, we're overloaded and ready to hire you if you want to try your hand!&#10;&#10;Cutterland is an innovative strategy board game in which you get to cut the cards &mdash; literally cut them into pieces and compete to create your own fabulous lands. You will divide the cards, distribute the pieces between the players, and score victory points for the creatures inhabiting your land. Whoever has the most attractive land at the end of the game wins!&#10;&#10;Cutterland includes a mode in which you can play with the cut-up pieces, and two &quot;recharge&quot; packs will be available for the game: &quot;Classics&quot;, which contains the base set of cards, and &quot;Mashroom&quot;, which features a new creature of the same name!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
