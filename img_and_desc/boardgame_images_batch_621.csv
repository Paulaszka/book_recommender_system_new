The arena: a sheet of paper set between the players. The fuel: Ultimate Battle cards and a good, thick marker! Do you have what it takes to out-think, out-maneuver, and out-sketch your opponents? Combine cards, launch devastating attacks, and defend against a barrage of creativity!&#10;&#10;In Ultimate Battle, the goal is to utterly destroy your opponent. In this creativity-fueled game it's one-hit destruction, so players must plan attacks and defenses carefully.&#10;&#10;The gameplay centers around two to four players each drawing from a deck of Ultimate Battle Cards. These fully illustrated cards contain everything from powerful weapons and creatures (like sharks and poison) to more mundane objects (like a brick). Using their imaginations, players must illustrate attacks against their opponents on a large sheet of paper rolled out between both players. The attacking player uses any combination of cards in their hand to launch their attack. The defending player must then use cards from their hand to defend.&#10;&#10;If players disagree on whether an attack or defense is valid a Disagreement Card is drawn, which quickly resolves any qualms. This gets the group back to playing as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;If a player can't defend an attack, or loses a disagreement when trying to defend, he or she is destroyed! Whether a world-class artist or a stick-figure impresario, everyone can draw out wild attacks in Ultimate Battle. Think quick, sketch even quicker, and may the best battler win!&#10;&#10;"

Players start by building a battlefield, recruiting knights to their army, then deploying them. Players act in turn to maneuver their knights on the battlefield, and the combat potential for each type of troop differs, with heavy armored units moving more slowly and fighting better than lighter units. Pikemen can stop cavalry, while archers and longbowmen want to keep enemy units below them and light cavalry are ideal for chasing archers on horseback. The unique system of combat results has no randomness.&#10;&#10;Players look for advantages and opportunities, attacking the enemy when it's too tired to run, for example, or claiming good terrain position. By using the power and mobility of his forces, a player tries to control more strategic points than his opponent and thereby win the game.&#10;&#10;"

A time of warring Earls, claiming whatever lands they could... establishing fiefs, cultivating powerful vassals, fighting and engaging in endless political struggles &mdash; all while Vikings roamed not just the sea, but the land. It is truly a Dark Age. Or is it? Lasting for 600 years, until the Norman Conquest of 1066, this era decided the future of a great kingdom that would become England.&#10;&#10;Designing your Earl Deck before play begins is one of the key features of the game. Ortus Regni is a deck-design game, rather than a deck-building game &mdash; that is, you are entirely in control of the deck that you will begin play with in a game of Ortus Regni. Several canonical Ortus Regni deck design concepts exist &mdash; such as a Lord deck, an Army (Land) deck, a Politics deck, or an Emissary (Monk) deck, and more &mdash; but such concepts are only the start of your design options. The Earl Deck you put together can be a subtle hybrid of several concepts, or something entirely different and unusual.&#10;&#10;Your opponents in Ortus Regni will have access to exactly the same suite of cards that you do when they design their own Earl Decks for game play. So it all comes down to your choices and your strategies! There is also tactical space during a game to zig and zag, even if you find yourself against an Earl Deck design that you did not anticipate. You might pull out an unexpected win nonetheless if you play your deck well.&#10;&#10;"

You might spend all your Action efforts to build up enough items to fulfill an order for a specific Client, but then the Player before you fulfills them leaving you at a disadvantage with items that you might not need now!!

After the First Apocalypse, the Terrans built endless numbers of space platforms to colonize space, and an agreement was brought forth between the Terrans and a mystical sect of great influence to lease the space platform CETUS-7. The ancient arena was rebuilt on top of the platform, taking the galactic fights into space.&#10;&#10;The Atomic Brotherhood holds all the broadcast rights for the Arena, netting them trillions of Credits for every minute of every fight. Their aptitude for organizing unconventional games makes them exceedingly popular with the masses, and now the time has come again. Gladiators from all over the galaxy are gathering on CETUS-7.

Each hero has different stats and abilities, allowing unique builds that depend on player choice.&#10;&#10;The game is played by 2-6 players and can be played as 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. In 1vs1, the players follow a draft procedure and pick 1-3 heroes out of the ten available. After both players have chosen their heroes, they prepare them to enter the Arena. Heroes can equip weapons and special abilities before combat. The arena board consists of a grid of hexagons with starting positions, secret traps, and treasure crates.&#10;&#10;Both players secretly choose, then reveal heroes, placing them on the two starting positions of the board. The hero with the highest initiative score plays first. The player controlling him is considered the attacker and his opponent is the defender. Each hero has a number of action points that can be used to perform his special abilities, to defend, or to attack. A ten-sided die is used for attacking and defending. The attacking player adds his hero's attack score to his attack roll and the defending player respectively adds his hero's defense score to his defense roll. When a hero is wounded, he loses health points &mdash; and at zero health, he's defeated.&#10;&#10;"

Who will be the best Hiyoko dripper?  \&quot;Hiyoko\&quot; means chickpea, but these chickpeas are so cute they almost look like little chicks.&#10;&#10;Players take turns in trying to tip out a combination of beans.  But you need to be careful as sometimes 1 bean may tip out...or a LOT!  Only the player who is able to get the right combination of beans over a certain amount of rounds (depending on the number of players) can be declared the Mame-ista winner!&#10;&#10;On a turn you tip out some beans, if you get a blend/straight combination you can try one more time to get another combination.  If you are unsuccessful, you remove 1 bean from the ones that fell out, and try one more time.&#10;&#10;"

Pick a deck - be that the horde of zombies, the superhero, the spaceship, or the fantasy army - and sparingly play cards to take down your opponents.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, players bid to determine the total cost of the cards they can play this round - however this is linked to the amount of drink consumed.  Cards, ranging from permanents (which remain in play until removed by the effects of another card) to counters (which can be used on an opponent's turn to hinder their strategy), are utilised to decrease a player's life points. Once they reach 0, they are eliminated.&#10;&#10;"

Castles are formed by 6 cards or locations, numbered 1 to 6.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players secretly roll a die and assault the matching location of their opponent's castle. However, players are allowed (and encouraged) to lie about their die result. The consequences of getting caught are dire, but getting away with the lie will bring victory much more swiftly. In addition, players have the option to manipulate luck by employing the services of powerful reinforcements.&#10;&#10;Whenever a location is destroyed, the card is flipped and can't be used or assaulted again. Once the Heart of the Castle is destroyed, the owner of the castle loses the game and their opponent is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;"
