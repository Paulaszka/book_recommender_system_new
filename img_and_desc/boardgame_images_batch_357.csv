Example: with PAT, you could name sPAT, PArT, sePAraTe, etc.  Then the score is the sum of the cards' values time the number of words stated.  There is a maximum of 5 words, and a time limit is recommended for the turns.  If the player thinks no word is possible he declares a Stymie, and if no one else can think of a word he gets 100 points; if someone can, she gets 50 points while the declarer loses 50.  After the deck runs out, highest total wins.&#10;&#10;There are several variations:&#10;&#10;1. Juniors - For younger players, use 2 cards instead.&#10;&#10;2. Sliders - use 2 cards, and only 5-letter words with both letters adjacent are allowed, one each of XXxxx, xXXxx, xxXXx, and xxxXX.&#10;&#10;3. Twos - Use 2 cards, and think of any number of words (up to ten), of any length, with both letters adjacent.&#10;&#10;4. Famous Names - Use 2 cards, and try to think of a famous name with those initials.&#10;&#10;5. Initials - Use 2 cards, and think of a phrase, or two related words, the begin with those two letters.  (E.g., with MD, Medical Doctor.)&#10;&#10;6. Solitaire - use 3 cards, and find only 1 word per triple; try to find one for each triple dealt.&#10;&#10;7. Charades - Use 2 cards, and act out a phrase starting with those two letters.&#10;&#10;"

You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops.

In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;The game is the first in a series.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is a stand alone game that is set on the Eastern Front and follows the German 11th Panzer (Ghost) Division&#10;&#10;Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.&#10;&#10;"

Many units (generally representing 5 or so vehicles) have primary and secondary weapons, with separate classifications, strengths and ranges for each. There are rules for artillery, air power, night fighting, minefields, and specialized tanks (Rhinos, flail tanks, etc.), among other things.&#10;&#10;Tables of organization and equipment are provided for the American, British, French, Soviet, German, and Italian forces for 1939-45.&#10;&#10;"

If the word is verified, the caller takes the entire packs containing the cards he used, and places them at the bottom of his hand.  Red letters may only be used as the first or last letter of their word.&#10;&#10;If two players call out at the same time, the longer word wins; if tied, the packs involved go into the pool.  If a word is wrong and challenged, the challenger gets the packs; if the challenge was incorrect, the challenger's pack goes into the pool.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one who gets all the cards; or, after a set length of time, it is the player with the highest total value in his cards.&#10;&#10;"
