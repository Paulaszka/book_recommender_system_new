Be the first to return them to your base and win the game! You need to dig through the pile of buff tiles in the middle row of the board to create a way to get to the other side. You use one of your Diggerdo pawns to turn over tiles on your opponent&rsquo;s side of the game board, digging up treasure in a square. Once you successfully find all 5 bags of treasure in your opponent&rsquo;s base and use your Gobbler pawn to bring them back to your base, you win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

They then proceed to move one of their pieces according to the chess moving scheme represented on the card (if you play a bishop you can move any of your pieces as if it was a bishop).&#10;&#10;Pieces are captured the same way you do in chess, but following the roshambo logic (eg: a scissor piece can only capture a paper piece).&#10;After a player has moved he draws another card and the turn passes to his opponent.&#10;&#10;Pieces  captured can be respawned in game using special cards and every capture is a point.&#10;&#10;After 15 turns the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. If a player is able to capture all 3 pieces of his opponent before he is able to respawn any of them the game ends immediately by knockout.&#10;&#10;Full rules and manual can be found on the official Scamorra site.&#10;&#10;"
