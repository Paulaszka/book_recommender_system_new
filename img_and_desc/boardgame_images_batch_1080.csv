In the game a fugitive known as 'Rabbit' has jumped bail, and John, the bondsman, has hired Bounty Hunters to retrieve him. Therefore, the game pits the Rabbit against 1 to 3 Bounty Hunters.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game differs between the Rabbit and the Bounty Hunters. The Rabbit's goal is to collect funds from his stash houses or jobs while evading the bounty hunter(s), and the Bounty Hunters goal is to capture the Rabbit before they run out of money.&#10;&#10;It is a roll and move game that's quick pace and fun, and also features a set of cards that directs the players of their actions.&#10;&#10;There are three different options for playing, so the fun can last anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours. Only one question remains: Will you be the Bondsman or the Rabbit? Your fate will be decided by the roll of the die.&#10;&#10;"

On your turn, you can move one of your pieces to an open square, move to take an opponent's piece or &quot;fend&quot; it (sending it to their reserve), place one of your reserved pieces on an open square, withdraw a piece, pass, or use various special moves and aspects of the pieces in play.&#10;&#10;Many of the core elements of chess are inverted, removed, or altered to more closely resemble corresponding aspects of fencing. For example, there is no check, and two-way checkmates are possible. There are multiple methods by which a player can make two moves at once, and a wide array of special moves allows for unpredictable ripostes. The 4x16 board is subdivided lengthwise into four &quot;measures&quot; which allow for unique piece movements and flexible range constraints.

The operational environment consists of a dynamic, modular interface constructed from 1 to 4 interconnected data-crystal mechanical matrices. A fixed neural-interface console serves as the primary interaction point, its haptic feedback and augmented reality overlays directly influenced by the spatial arrangement of the data-crystal matrices.&#10;Each data-crystal matrix represents a discrete, yet interdependent, sub-system of the EVA core. Their internal logic is deeply embedded and non-linear, exhibiting emergent behaviors that defy conventional algorithmic prediction. The optimal operational sequence for each matrix is not immediately discernible, demanding iterative experimentation and intuitive understanding of their intricate feedback loops.&#10;&#10;The primary challenge lies in orchestrating a synergistic interaction between all active engine elements. Failure to achieve a state of resonant collaboration will preclude successful core restoration. Activation of individual elements triggers cascading, sequential effects. However, the resultant output is highly context-dependent, dynamically shifting based on the spatial adjacency and operational status of neighboring matrices. This proximity-based influence can yield either beneficial cascading repairs or detrimental system instabilities.&#10;&#10;At times, a counter-intuitive approach may be necessary, deliberately guiding element activations towards seemingly adverse outcomes. This may be a manifestation of the engine's internal &quot;learning&quot; protocols, offering delayed, unpredictable rewards in the form of stabilized or repaired components several operational cycles later. The EVA core communicates not through explicit data streams, but through subtle shifts in its energy signature, haptic pulses through the neural interface, and cryptic visual patterns within the data-crystal matrices &ndash; a form of bio-digital learning that demands patience and unconventional problem-solving.&#10;&#10;Current Status: Awaiting operator input. Core integrity at critical levels. Time is a diminishing resource.&#10;&#10;"
