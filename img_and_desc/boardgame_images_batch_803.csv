He commanded tribute from Israel&rsquo;s neighbors, expanded Israel&rsquo;s borders, built roads and fortresses, and kept the peace within the land. His merchants filled the kingdom with exotic goods such as spices, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Perhaps most famously, Solomon also built the Temple in Jerusalem, a golden place of worship lasting hundreds of years.&#10;&#10;Wisdom of Solomon is a 1-5 player worker placement game taking place during the reign of King Solomon. Players act as Governors for Solomon, sending out workers to gather Resources, build structures, and expand Solomon&rsquo;s influence in the kingdom. The player who curries the most Favor will be crowned the winner!&#10;&#10;The Wisdom of Solomon board is divided into two sections. The section on the right side of the board is a map of Solomon&rsquo;s kingdom where players will build custom houses and roads. As a Governor expands their influence in the land with new roads and houses, that Governor&rsquo;s network will become more powerful and pull Resources from more and more areas. These networks of custom houses will control the flow of Resources in Wisdom of Solomon!&#10;&#10;On the left side of the board is a miniaturized version of the city of Jerusalem. Within this city is the Market area, a region of the city where workers will be sent to buy, sell, and trade Resources and also to play powerful Fortune cards that have been acquired. Elsewhere in Jerusalem is a Foreman who has the plans for building new structures throughout Israel. A Governor can use their Resources to build these structures and create new houses of influence in the kingdom, while granting the Governor new ways to gain Resources and Favor.&#10;&#10;Finally, within the city of Jerusalem a Governor may visit the Levites to help build the Temple of Solomon. Workers send to the Levites can donate Resources to raise this awesome structure and gain great Favor and Fortune! Next to this Temple are the Holy Places, the most sacred of objects that groups of workers may visit and receive great things!&#10;&#10;Wisdom of Solomon ends when a Governor no longer has a Custom House to build or the Temple of Solomon has been completed. When that occurs, the round ends and each person reveals their Temple Tokens. Each Governor tallies their final score and the person having the most Favor wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

At the end of each turn, players gain points based on the placement of these blocks. Three times during the game, it will snow and this is when players receive extra points based on the number of cubes of their colour present in the level being tallied up. The snowdrifts are then added to each building, fitting around and hiding the level that has just been tallied, therefore limiting the remaining space available to gain points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game&#10;Each turn, a player draws a card illustrating a type of construction block, taking the one indicated from the stock pile. They need to add the block to one of the buildings in line with the rules of play: a wall must not be more than 3 cubes high; blocks must be within limits shown on the foundation tiles; blocks must not be inserted underneath another one already in play etc. Once the block has been placed, one point is awarded for each newly added cube of the player&rsquo;s colour, with further points being added for all the cubes already in play of the same color that this new block touches. Therefore, players should try to have as many of the cubes already in play of their colour touching those of corresponding colour in the newly placed block to maximize their score per turn. Also, strategically played ally cards and colourless blocks allow players to increase their scores.&#10;When a snowflake card is drawn from the construction-block deck, the game stops, and points are awarded to each player based on the number of cubes of their colour found in the level being tallied. The snowdrifts are then added. This happens three times during the game. When the first snowflake card is drawn, points are tallied for the first level of each of the three construction sites. When the second snowflake card is drawn, points are tallied for the second level. Finally, when the third snowflake is drawn the tally is done for the third and final level, and the game ends. The tally sticks placed next to each building indicate how points are attributed each level. On the tally sticks there are +, - and x 2 symbols indicating how many points players win or lose based on the number of cubes of their colour in the level being tallied.&#10;&#10;End of the Game &#10;The game ends when the third snow flake is turned over. Points are tallied for a final time for the third floor of each construction site.
