To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&#10;&#10;The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&#10;&#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.&#10;&#10;"

There are 10 'incident' cards which are put face down on the table, and each player also has 14 movement cards, on which there are depicted 4 possible actions and one or more arrows.&#10;&#10;The players choose a movement card simultaneously and put them together. The arrow(s) on the card of player 1 determine the actions player B has to take and vice-versa.&#10;&#10;First to finish wins the game.&#10;&#10;Originally released by Edizioni Giochi Lasco from Milan, 1952, this game was re-released in 1993 by Edizioni Lo Scarabeo from Torino.&#10;&#10;"

Physics-based systems model aircraft performance differences correctly and simply through the use of only two elegant playaids; graphical computers known as nomograms. Missiles fly out towards their targets without player intervention, using proper kinematics from launch and flowing seamlessly into the underlying flight engine. The core of Birds of Prey is the PHAD - the Pitch, Heading, and Attitude Display, a simple tool allowing players to track their the orientation of an aircraft in three dimensions. The PHAD makes it trivial to find the relative position (bearings) and relative motion between maneuvering aircraft. It also makes figuring blind spots where you can't sight other aircraft a trivial exercise, regardless of whether the aircraft is flying straight and level, has its nose pointing straight up, or is in the middle of a wingover.&#10;&#10;The lavishly illustrated Birds of Prey tutorial guides you through learning the game solo, while the rulebook is a reference for rules questions only. The play aids are built to keep the rulebook in the box during play. Laminated play-aids use a system of hints that lead players through flight and eases return to play. Full-color box-miniatures are placed on tilt-blocks and stacking tiles showing altitude, pitch, roll and heading and bringing the three-dimensional fight to life.&#10;&#10;"

Each player has 15 unique pieces in his own color, arranged on the dark squares of the nearest three ranks. From left to right, the pieces are one through five stars (first rank), moons (second rank) and suns (third rank).&#10;&#10;The pieces move one square diagonally in any direction to a vacant square, or must leap over one opposing piece (only opposing pieces, but without capture - there are no captures in Salta) if the square immediately beyond is vacant. Only one jump is made (no chain jumping), and missed opportunities to jump may be forced by the opponent, although a player is free to choose among several available jumps. Blockading all of the opposing pieces is not allowed, although some may be temporarily blocked as long as the opponent still has a legal move.&#10;&#10;The goal is to be the first player to move all of his pieces seven rows ahead - i.e. into the starting places of the opposing piece. However, the order from left to right and front to back should be kept. Thus, reading from left to right, the goal position is one through five suns (tenth rank), one through five moons (ninth rank) and one through five stars (eighth rank). The player first achieving this position wins by as many points as the number of moves opponent would need to achieve his goal position.&#10;&#10;If neither player reaches the goal position by the time 120 moves have been made by each player, the score is calculated as the difference between the number of moves each player would need to reach the goal position, as if the board were clear of opposing pieces.&#10;&#10;"
