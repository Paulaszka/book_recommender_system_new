The cards are numbered from 1 to 60; you initially place them in your rack in the order they're dealt. On your turn, you draw from the deck or the discard pile, swapping the card with one from your rack.&#10;&#10;Super Racko let's you play with double racks and double the fun!

First, I wanted to give the wargamer a realistic simulation of Ranger operations. Second, I felt the need to keep the game playable. Most tactical games have hundreds of complicated rules to memorize, but bear no relation to actual field maneuvers . . . Patrolling suits solitaire gaming fairly well. While conventional operations are the result of the efforts of numerous commanders and staff officers, patrols generally depend entirely on the patrol leader's actions . . . I made every attempt to present the tactical situations as the patrol leader would experience them. I wanted the game system to avoid excessive administrative bookkeeping and rules memorization . . . I tried to simulate patrolling from my own experiences and not be tied to more standard wargame conventions . . . The element of chance throughout Ranger is by design. No patrol leader can control his environment. He can only plan for as many possibilities as he has time and be alert and prepared to implement these contingency plans if necessary. Even the most experienced player making all the correct decisions will occasionally be destroyed. Combat is always dangerous, but even more so when forward of friendly lines.&quot;&#10;&#10;Components: Rules of Play booklet, Patrolling Tactics booklet, Tactical Events booklet, laminated game map, laminated Patrol Record Log, plastic Tactical Template, Glossary folder, Combat Results Card, Tactical Reference Card, Extended Patrolling Card, 18 Mission Cards, 2 six-sided dice, China marker pencil.&#10;&#10;"

Drang Nach Osten! is a complete wargame of the largest invasion in history, but may be incorporated into the larger series of game/simulations collectively titled Europa. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian Campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942.  Unentschieden (Europa II) continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire war in the East, 1941-45.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Five 21 x 27&quot; mapsheets (numbered Europa 1 through 5).&#10;    One set of eight unit countersheets (for a total of 1792 counters) consisting of:&#10;    Two Europa sheet 1&#10;    One Europa sheet 2&#10;    Three Europa sheet 3&#10;    One Europa sheet 4&#10;    One Europa sheet 5 (half-sheet)&#10;    One rules folder and cover.&#10;    One set of charts and tables consisting of:&#10;        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle&#10;        One Soviet Order of Appearance&#10;        One Soviet Units Appearing Chart&#10;        One German Initial Order of Battle&#10;        One German Order of Appearance&#10;        One German Units Appearing Chart&#10;        Two Combat Results Tables&#10;        One Unit Identification Chart&#10;        One Time Record Chart&#10;        One Terrain Effects on Combat Chart&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Notes:&#10;&#10;Each hex is 16 miles, each turn is two weeks. Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. There is a fair amount of unit specialisation, although at 20 pages the rules are far less intimidating by today's standards than when they first appeared over thirty years ago. Drang Nach Osten! lasts for 19 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Mar II 42), so allowing for the initial set up 20 sessions of several hours is a realistic playing time.&#10;&#10;"

Morale fluctuates as units move, rest or attack. Should you pull this battalion out of the line to rest ? Or will one more push carry the position ?&#10;&#10;Artillery plays a crucial role too. Good observation posts are essential for accurate fire.

6978,,"Neutron is a two-player abstract strategy board game played on a square board with a 5x5 grid.&#10;&#10;Each player has five tokens of different colors that start on the baseline of the board closest to them. A single token of a third color called the Neutron starts in the center of the board. To win, either surround the Neutron or move it to your baseline. On a turn, a player does these two actions in this order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move the Neutron: Move it any direction to the furthest vacant square possible without leaping over other tokens; if you can't move it, you lose (because the other player has surrounded it).&#10;    Move one of your tokens: Move it any direction to the furthest square possible without leaping over other tokens.&#10;&#10;&#10;On the first turn, the starting player skips the Neutron move.&#10;&#10;Neutron was invented by Robert A. Kraus and first appeared in 1978. Bobail is nearly identical to Neutron, except in Bobail the Neutron can only move one vacant adjacent space. The publishers of Bobail claim that it's a traditional African game that pre-dates Neutron, but there is no evidence to back up this claim.&#10;&#10;"
