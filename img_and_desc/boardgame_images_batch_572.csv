The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etc. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;This new Big Box contains the base game, plus the most popular of the expansions: Inns &amp; Cathedrals, Traders and Builders, Princess &amp; Dragon, Abbey &amp; Mayor, and Bridges, Castles, &amp; Bazaars.&#10;&#10;"

All the cards from those suits are shuffled, and drawn one-by-one.&#10;&#10;Each time a card is drawn, one member of the matching gang is allowed to take to actions, such as move, shoot, aim or recover. When a court card is drawn, all members of that gang are allowed to act.&#10;&#10;If a player does not want to perform an action, he can hold the card, and use it to interrupt another player later on in the game.&#10;&#10;"

If you have bad tires, have a lot of fuel or are in a sharp turn, you are limited to a maximum of four spaces. On good tires on the straight way you may have a speed of ten spaces at a maximum.&#10;&#10;Your car starts with proper tires, and you may choose to use the highest speed die. The actual number of spaces you move on your turn is evaluated by rolling a die (premium edition) or drawing a card (basic edition), so if you're unlucky, you may move only three spaces when rolling a ten-sided die, while another player moves six spaces although he was limited to a maximum speed of six (using the six-sided die). Reducing your amount of fuel allows you to reroll the die or add a number of spaces to your die result equal to your position (1 when you are the leader, 6 if you are the last in the field).&#10;&#10;Your tires lose quality when completing a round, crossing curbstones, or driving into cars in front of you, so you may be forced to take the pit lane, refresh your tires, and take new fuel.&#10;&#10;Slicks is probably the first racing game in which the condition of your tires directly impacts your maximum speed. Although some luck is needed, the strategy of when to make a pit stop or when to take a worse position to stay on a better space is important and makes Slicks unique in the category of racing games.&#10;&#10;"

Every units will have a generic behaviour depending by the orders thay have and will change that only if a new order is delivered. Greater armies will have a more complex chain of command so orders must be delivered by voice or by other means (banner bearers and herlads can be too far) so couriers are employed.&#10;&#10;The careful management of orders given or changed during a game is the key to vistory because you must be able to react to the situations that can arise!

Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.&#10;&#10;All was well in the galaxy &ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &quot;Wolf&quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.&#10;&#10;All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &quot;Shepherd&quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.&#10;&#10;You are a Sheep.&#10;You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.&#10;You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.&#10;You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.&#10;You know how to defeat Wolf &ndash; &quot;Ewe's The Force...&quot;&#10;&#10;Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),&#10;     Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or&#10;     Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).&#10;&#10;In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.&#10;&#10;Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player's cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.&#10;     If players have found a Defender, place the player's cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards &ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &ndash; then the Infiltrators win.&#10;&#10;Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).&#10;&#10;"

At least two teams oppose each other, competing to score the 3 decisive goals that lead to victory. The teams usually belong to powerful corporations or mere independents, and the players come from the entire Galaxy (human beings, androids, genetic experiments or aliens). ULTRIUM SPHERE has become the most popular game throughout the universe and is watched by hundreds of billions of entities. The players who manage to survive the game and perform outstandingly well are virtually elevated to the rank of Divinities and are named the ULTRAs. &#10; In ULTRIUM SPHERE, each player is the leader of an Ultrium Sphere team, which he/she tries to lead to victory.&#10;Each team consists of two decks:  25 Ultra Cards and 25 Interaction Cards. The Ultra Cards represent the team members and describe their race and various characteristics, offensive (tackling, attack, shot) and defensive (resistance, save, pass). The Interaction cards are the different strategies that the team can apply. &#10;At the beginning of the game, each player draws 4 Interaction Cards and 6 Ultra Cards. The 6 Ultras are to be laid out in two lines, the attack line and the defense line (3 Ultras in each line). The Interaction cards stay in hand. &#10;The Ultras can be used either for their special ability or to carry out various actions according to their place on the field. The strikers can undermine the opponent&rsquo;s defense (tackling, attack) or try to shoot a goal. The defenders can make passes to strikers (a pass must take place prior to every shot at goal) or stop the opponent&rsquo;s shots. The player must activate the Ultras (i.e. turn them at a 90-degree angle) when he/she uses them. Once activated, the Ultras can no longer be used. Therefore, the player must not activate all his/her Ultras during his/her turn, since the activated Ultras will not be able to defend during the opponent&rsquo;s turn. When the player chooses to play an action, he/she must cast a 12-sided die and add the Ultra&rsquo;s personal bonus for the action chosen. To know whether the action succeeds or not, the player compares the total to a success threshold, which must be exceeded or not depending on the type of action.&#10;The Interaction card may be used at any time to strengthen one&rsquo;s own Ultras or weaken the opponent&rsquo;s Ultras. &#10;When the turn begins, the player draws 1 Interaction card and set all his/her Ultras upright. First, he/she can replace Ultras and have 2 Ultras swap place. He/she can then use the Ultras and Interaction cards.&#10;When the player can no longer or does no longer want to carry out any action, or when he/she scores a goal, his/her turn ends and the opponent can begin his/her turn.&#10;The game goes on until one of the players scores 3 goals.&#10;&#10;"

Nevertheless, throughout the 1800&rsquo;s and early 1900&rsquo;s, periodic tensions arose between the two North American neighbors, whether over direct political, territorial or trade concerns or (in most cases) by extension of the rivalry between the United States and the British Empire.

Taking its name from the 1930 U.S. Army-Navy Joint Board War Plan Red color designation for Canada (&ldquo;Crimson&rdquo;), the game presents hypothetical warships designed for service in the unique environment of the lakes, and characterizes the potential actions for control of the region through 12 battle and 22 operational  scenarios.  All of the pieces necessary to play the game are present: a 24 x 28-inch operational map of the Great Lakes region including lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior, a 24 x 24-inch tactical map, 50 &quot;long&quot; double-sized ship pieces and 180 standard-sized pieces, all of them laser-cut and mounted.&#10;&#10;"

The first player to control six mines wins in this lightly strategic game of dice rolling and area control.&#10;&#10;Player turns consist of three phases: Terraforming, Recruiting, and Deployment. Terraforming expands the play area by adding new mineable Tiles to the board. Recruiting new Stations is done by rolling and re-rolling Station Dice; each Tile can only be mined by specific Station Dice combinations, for example: sets, straights, larges, odds, etc. The Deployment phase is when you place your Dice on the board. As Stations are deployed, they attack and possibly destroy enemies in neighboring sectors. Each Tile grants an advantage for either mining or deploying Dice to them. And no turn is ever wasted, with single use Utility Cards that are provided to players who are either unable or unwilling to make a deployment.&#10;&#10;"

A player may have no more than one queen at a time except when capturing a pawn or a queen that stands on a red square and in the next move must move one of the queens off a red square.

Your instructions are to carry the war to the enemy in the manner you best see fit, but not so as to endanger either the realm or the royal purse. If you fail, there will be... displeasure. Your duties commence at once. Do not return without victory.&#10;&#10;In 1741, while the rest of Europe involved itself in yet another interminable succession war, Sweden and Russia squared off in yet another of their own squabbles for dominance in the Baltic. The Russian monarchy was unstable, and a cabal of Swedish hawks - whose party was known as the Hats - sought to replace the current empress with one friendly to Sweden. France, Sweden's paymaster, encouraged the plan, hoping to distract Russia from affairs in Europe. The Swedes would claim some of the territory taken from them during the Great Northern War. Either the new empress would grant them the land out of gratitude for their aid, or their armies would simply take it. It was a daring plan, and one beyond Sweden's means. And yet it came very close to success. The coup went off as planned, but the Russian Army, led by one of Europe's best marshals - Peter Lacy of County Clare - struck first, upsetting the Swedish timetable. Instead of the Swedish army managing the palace coup from the Winter Palace, it was floundering in the snows of Karelia when the new regime took power. Now, unable to acquire the territory they desired through negotiations, the Hats foolishly challenged the full might of Russia to a trial of arms...&#10;&#10;The Russo-Swedish War of 1741-1743, otherwise called the Hats' War or the War of the Hats, has to be the most obscure conflict Red Sash Games has tackled so far. Measured by the butcher's bill, it was hardly a minor one, however, with something like 50,000 casualties. Historically, it was a fiasco for the Swedes, but partly this was due to bad luck - an epidemic ravaged their fleet - and partly due to internal politics. Surely, as the Swedish generalissimo, YOU can do better? If you choose to play the Russians instead, you will have many, many troops, and excellent commanders to lead them, but you will be faced by deadlines as the diplomats are already discussing peace terms. Will you be able to make a name for yourself before they pull the curtain down?&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;ALW is a two-player operational study of the War of the Hats, fought between the Swedes and the Russians in the years 1741-1743. Included in the game is a set of the latest basic rules, charts, and tables (version 3.75) for the Lace Wars system.&#10;&#10;A few key concepts in this system include Operations Points, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. Operations Points are accumulated during periods of inactivity, in order to be spent during the course of active campaigning. If a player is unable or unwilling to spend OPs, his forces suffer attrition instead. The further forces are from their base of operations, the more severe the penalties will be. Whoever has the most OPs also has the initiative.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players alternate moving their formations, laying siege to fortresses and engaging in battle with the enemy field forces. The players have a degree of flexibility in what they do with their forces, but they are constrained by the Campaign Plan or plans that they choose. These dictate what objectives (usually fortresses) must be taken. A successfully completed plan will garner Prestige for a player. At the end of the game, the player with the highest prestige wins. In addition, bonuses can be won for victory in battle, and these may be used to buy rewards that improve a player's chances, or be used as influence.&#10;&#10;The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sommar Skr&aring;la - The Baltic, 1741-1743&#10;&#10;Sommar Skr&aring;la is the second of a set of games covering the Age of Sail at an Operational level. While the War of the Austrian Succession raged elsewhere in Europe, and around the globe, in the Baltic Sweden and Russia faced off in the little known War of the Hats. At one level, the war had been engineered by France to keep Russia from helping Austria, but at another level, it was a war to reclaim Sweden's lost empire. The war was poorly managed by Sweden, and for a number of reasons they suffered a catastrophe of the first water &ndash; especially, the war was begun to help a Russian princess overthrow the current dynasty (in return for territorial concessions that were not forthcoming); a war with such an object was sure to be a confused affair.&#10;&#10;Sommar Skr&aring;la also examines the possibility of Danish intervention. In reality, the Danish Prince Royal was an heir-presumptive candidate for the Swedish crown (the Swedes having an elective monarchy), and the Danish King assembled men and ships to help Sweden defend this choice against Russia. But Sweden, in the end chose a candidate favored by Russia (as the price of peace) and the Danes very nearly went to war against Sweden instead.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Sommar Skr&aring;la is a two player strategy game. You command either the Swedish or Muscovite (Russian) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organizing your &quot;sail&quot; (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at &quot;battle readiness&quot; is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters in play is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players. A special campaign scenario allows the players to link Sommar Skr&aring;la with its companion Lace Wars game &ndash; A Lesser Wrath.&#10;&#10;"

Six pre-generated characters are included as well as blank cards for  people to create their own. Each Hunter character is rated 1 to 5 on six different attributes. Event cards and player actions will test the skills of each Hunter character.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players execute two actions from among nine different choices. The players are attempting to find a good hunting area while increasing their rating on the Deer Encounter Meter, which is a measure of progress toward finding where the deer are located. Eventually, players will execute Hunt actions in the hopes of seeing deer. Once a player determines that deer are present, the deer need to be identified and brought in close enough for a shot. As the deer move closer and the encounter continues, the alertness level of the deer will generally begin to increase as they sense danger nearby. If the players aren't careful, the deer may flee and ruin their chances for a shot.&#10;&#10;Players have to manage their Energy levels, items, Hunter cards and save up for bonuses while staying aware of what the other players are doing and attempt to blunt their efforts where possible.&#10;&#10;"

Both players use action cards to move pawns around the districts, but they each have very different goals.&#10;&#10;The rebels use hidden rebel cells and their rebel leader to fulfil plots by doing sabotage, making assasinations, and spreading propaganda throughout the districts.

This allows riots to spread from the slums towards the imperial palace. If that happens, the rebels also win.&#10;&#10;The empire player, meanwhile, try to either uncover the plots by sorrounding cells with armies and revealing them, or to capture the rebel leader by clever use of both armies and the secret police. If the empire player uncovers all three plots or captures the leader, he/she wins.&#10;&#10;In order to win you have to plan carefully while still being able to adapt to an unlucky draw of action cards.

A player is allowed to move either pieces of their color or grey pieces, but with these two cardinal rules: First, they are not allowed to move any grey pieces the other player moved on their previous turn, and, second, no piece may ever be separate from the rest of the pieces at the end of any action.&#10;&#10;When a player scores a Trigram, they flip the piece that landed on it to its other side, which now makes it a normal grey piece.

Score points by comparing the total number of koi of a suit in your pond and your house. Score points equal to the *lower* number. Score each suit of koi in this manner.
