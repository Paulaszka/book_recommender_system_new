Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.&#10;&#10;When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

The number on the tile dictates how many spaces the player moves around the board, and an arrow on the space where the player ends his turn indicates the row or column where that tile must be placed.  This row or column is then scored based on the tiles present in it.  Red and blue tiles belong to each player; yellow tiles placed in the center can be scored by either player provided the row or column including them contains more points in his color than his opponent.  Once a row or column is scored, it cannot be scored again for the rest of the game.  Highest score after all possible tiles have been played wins.&#10;&#10;"

Before the players hand in their guesses, R chooses three players of which he/she thinks that they've guessed correctly. The chosen players show their guesses and R shows his/her answer. For each matching answer R gets one point, the chosen players get 2 points if they've guessed correctly. Now all the other guesses are collected and counted. All other players (i.e. everyone except R and the 3 chosen players) get one point if the majority has guessed correctly. Then the next player becomes R. The game ends when each player has been R once. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;Suggested minimum number of players: 8&#10;&#10;3) A situation and the three reactions are read. Each player decides how he/she would react and writes down the corresponding letter on a slip of paper. The answers are handed in. Now each player guesses how many people have chosen answers A, B and C. They right the numbers down in a table. Then the answers are counted. Players get 3 points for a correct guess, one points if their guess is off by one.&#10;The game ends after 14 situations.

This is particularly obvious in the person who was intended to be the driver. He gets behind the wheel. It's a 20-minutes' drive. There is no bus that late at night and we want to get home fast.&#10;Possible reactions: &quot;A: I ask the driver if he's confident he can do it. If he says yes, I'll go with him this one time. After all, it isn't far and we can take back roads.&quot; &#10;&quot;B: We judge who's most likely to be capable of driving and decide on a driver that way.&quot; &#10;&quot;C: Under no circumstances am I going to drive or take a ride with a drunken driver.

Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected.&#10;&#10;Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends).&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes!&#10;&#10;In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed.  The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately.  Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects.&#10;&#10;Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.  It's easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes.&#10;&#10;"

At the start of the game, the ears are randomly (and without knowing the colour) distributed on the starting spaces.&#10;Players take turns rolling the die. A die roll can be used to move one ear the corresponding number of spaces vertically or horizontally, or the roll can be split among several ears. If a player rolls a six, he/she has several options:&#10;- He/she can move ears as in a normal roll.&#10;- He/she can roll again and look at the colour markings of a number of ears corresponding to the die roll.&#10;- He/she can place an ear of which he/she knows it is his/her colour directly onto a target space.&#10;A player can decide not to move on his/her turn and use a joker card instead. The active player then rolls the die to determine how many ears he/she may inspect.&#10;When players have found out which ears are theirs, they try to move them to their target spaces as secretly as possible. When an ear has reached a target space, it is turned over and the colour is shown to all players. If it is the wrong colour, it goes to one of the target spaces of the player it belongs to.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of one player's ears have reached their target spaces. Each ear that has reached its target space is worth 5 points, each joker card that hasn't been used up is worth two points. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

You play as the leader of one of these tribes, each with a unique method of governing their people, a specific moral alignment, and explicit spiritual beliefs. You are leading a small group of lieutenants and followers. Your objective, specific to your unique character and motivations, is to mold this emerging world in the way you best see fit.&#10;&#10;Explore the wasteland to find essential materials, find and recruit other small pockets of survivors, and discover the competing tribes. You must conquer hearts, minds and bodies if you want to emerge as your region's guiding force in forging the world to come The Day After Tomorrow.&#10;&#10;In the early game, players explore and expand by revealing hidden tiles, hoping to find modest food sources that will allow them to add tribe members, find groups of other survivors who may be interested in joining forces, fighting for their autonomy, or simply keeping an arms-length relationship. Most importantly players are hoping to find precious rare materials such as ammunition, horses and power sources to assist their growth and expansion.&#10;&#10;Through exploration players discover one another on our unique modular hex map system. Then the main phase of the game begins, where culture and religion pass between connected tribes, where the leaders fight for the best people, and each tribe's rare and valuable resources are being plundered during daring raids and defended by courageous sacrifices. Tribes will need to work together in order to achieve shared ends, but ultimately the most important thing is: will your particular vision for the world to come end up proving dominant?&#10;&#10;The characters in The Day After Tomorrow are brought to life with voluminous text in a choose-your-own-adventure style. You will need to carefully roleplay your leader as adhering to his or her particular moral, spiritual and governmental predilections is required to achieve success. There will be numerous character choices for players to make and, for those who want The Day After Tomorrow to do so, the design is intended to support deep RPG-style character play.&#10;&#10;"

The terrain can be as elaborate or as simple as you like; but the game is best played with lots of cover (buildings, trees, rocks, downed landing ships, etc). The playing area can represent anything from a futuristic cityscape to an alien forest to a Bug-infested hive!&#10;&#10;Each player controls a Force that can be as small as a squad (6-15 models) up to a platoon or even a company in size (40-100 models or more). Some Forces may involve more models than others since they consist either of less skilled human troops (like colonial militia or poorly armed and trained conscripts) or aliens whose strength lies in their overwhelming numbers. As players become more experienced, they can control larger numbers of troops as well as vehicles and incorporate more advanced rules for future warfare. At its most basic size (squad level), a game of Alien War should take an hour or less to play.&#10;&#10;"

The players buy, assemble and paint miniatures for use with the game. The miniatures come with stat cards, these stats will also be available in a rulebook. The stat card tells the player how far the model can move, how many dice it uses to attack, how many dice it gets while defending, how far its combat reach is how many hits the model can sustain before being removed from gameplay as dead and the level of faith it has in its God.&#10;&#10;Monsters, heroes, and gods of different pantheons battle in a miniatures skirmish game. Intuitive dice-based combat.  Cards list what models can accomplish, and dice rolls determine hits and blocks. Rolling the power die in special situations can prevent un-blockable hits.&#10;&#10;Players start off by choosing a God from a pantheon to play as their main character. Players then decide on a point total for the game they want to play. Once the point total is decided, each player puts together an army with models (using the models point cost) that equal up to the point total decided by the players. Players can only use models from their chosen pantheon at this time. There is the possibility that some  pantheons may be able to benefit from rogue legends in the future. Players are allowed to select one coin that they possess to use during the game. Different coins will be manufactured with different abilities. Some coins will be standard while others will be collectible items sold only during certain times of the year or at specific locations.&#10;&#10;If a God is killed during the game, the faith scores of all the models on that team are reduced making them more likely to fail psychology checks. If a God is the only model left on the board, the God loses the ability to use any influence. Influence is a score that tells a God how much magic he can use every round. When a God is left without followers, he loses his magic ability.&#10;&#10;"

They have convinced Bilbo to embark on a most unexpected journey &ndash; but first Gandalf, along with the Dwarves Dwalin, Kili and Fili, must find the other ten Dwarves who are lost in the Hobbit holes of Hobbiton.&#10;&#10;In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the players first build the game out of LEGO bricks, then they take turns rolling a special six-sided die. If a player rolls 1-3, he moves his figure the number of spaces rolled and uses a torch to lift a piece out of the Hobbit hole on which he landed. Hopefully the bottom of the piece shows a Dwarf. If so, the player keeps the Dwarf and play passes to the left. If a player finds a Hobbit instead, he lifts a piece out of any other Hobbit hole on the board in an attempt to locate another Hobbit; if the player finds a match, he keeps the pair of Hobbits and is rewarded with the opportunity to peek at the bottom of a piece from any other Hobbit hole.&#10;&#10;Instead of a Hobbit or Dwarf, some pieces feature a picture of breakfast. Matching two breakfasts allows a player to take a Dwarf piece already obtained by an opponent and return it to the Hobbit hole of his choice. The last possibility when revealing a piece is to find a picture of a rune. Matching two runes allows a player to select another Hobbit hole of his choice; if he finds a Dwarf in this location, he keeps it and play passes to the left. The custom die also features a picture of a map on one side. Rolling the map allows a player to move to any Hobbit hole on the board.&#10;&#10;After all ten Dwarves have been found, the player with the most Dwarves wins. The game comes with variant rules, including one that shifts the location of Hobbit holes by swinging portions of the board into different configurations. Another variant requires players to find Thorin, the leader of the Dwarves, last. Another places Bilbo in one of the Hobbit holes.&#10;&#10;"
