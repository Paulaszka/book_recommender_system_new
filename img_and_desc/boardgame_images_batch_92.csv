Younger players play it just like the classic Memory game by turning over two cards and trying to find the pairs. Older players play it by trying to find the four cards that match objects named in a riddle. The pictures are beautiful.&#10;&#10;"

Elections take place in the citadels, markets and temples around the city. These elections will name the nine representatives who will sit at the high council. Each party must carefully divide its soldiers, merchants and priests, to obtain the majority of votes during the elections. These elections follow each another in each of the areas of the city. The struggle is tense and all manner of dirty tricks are allowed. Each faction has the capacity to apply pressure on the others and has the chance of canceling their votes. Tyrus is thus a game of careful application of power, force and influence in order to affect the best outcome possible for your political party. Throughout the game you must try to carefully conserve your troops, because you never know when they will be needed. Both parties start the game with equal forces, so Bluff and misdirection are your main weapons to win the day, and become Master of the city.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bo&#195;&#174;te &#195;&#160; jeux (turn-based)&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;"

You then pause the VCR and score whatever points are shown, double them if the space on the board you are on matches the event you just watched. You will then be given the number of spaces to move your token on the board which represents a mountain with three different ski trails down it and ski lifts back up. You can begin to collect medals by accumulating 500 points in a certain event and then landing on a special space for that event to collect the next medal. The first to do this in each event gets the gold for that event, the next the silver, and so on. There are also spaces on the board that can set you back or have you draw a card. The cards can add to your score, set you back or be a lift ticket, which entitles you to move back up the board at any time. After all nine gold medals have been won the game is over and the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This is a great game for the whole family and the replayability of this game is very high. Even after going through the tape many times each game is still unique.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to win the gold?&#10;&#10;"

10624,,"EmotrionsOnCards is a strategy card game for all ages that belongs to the Emotrions line of games, which also includes board games (soon) and digital games (in development phase). The main feature of the Emotrions line is that it introduces the issue of Emotional Intelligence into a sector traditionally focused on the development of analytical intelligence.&#10;&#10;EmotrionsOnCards is a really entertaining and addictive game. It's also easy to learn due to its few and consistent rules. There's a conscious balance between a distillate simplicity, which makes it possible for everybody to play in a more relaxed - &quot;light&quot; - manner, and a depth of game which will satisfy the classic strategy game hard players.&#10;&#10;In EmotrionsOnCards, the cards, called emotrions, represent the basic human feelings: love, hatred, joy, sadness, fury, indecision... Some emotrions score points, others take them away. And they keep intermingling in your hand, when playing each trick, and even when you win!&#10;&#10;It is very powerful as a strategy game. The miracle lays in its innovative logic, with negative and positive playing cards.&#10;&#10;With only 36 cards and some minimal rules you'll be able to unfold many complex and shady situations. And you can also play different games with the same set of cards, such as The Pareo Game.&#10;&#10;Strategy, psychology and luck &#10;EmotrionsOnCards sets off from a Standard style featuring a careful balance between Strategy, Psychology and Luck. But you may just as well alter this balance with The Winner's Options, to suit the winner of the previous hand. Thus, the most &quot;psychological&quot; players will prefer a more uncertain style, and the lovers of sheer strategy will demand a more analytical style. The possibility of modulating the game allows players with different profiles to enjoy, and feel the game as just right for them.&#10;&#10;Philosophy&#10;All the game is a carefully made metaphor on how we manage our emotions, and other people's, in everyday life. As you try to master the strategy, you'll learn that in order to win in the long run (the game), it is always necessary to consider the effects of a particular battle (stake/trick), even if it means losing it.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of the game is to make us reflect on the fact that in real life there's no such thing as obviously good or bad situations, but more or less complex positions in which the thin line between success and failure relies on our managing little things. It is possible to win, even if we get a bad hand.&#10;&#10;"
