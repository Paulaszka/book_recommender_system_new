Each turn the player moves through the station building the map with a deck of room tiles. In between movement a die is rolled to see where Robots and Aliens show up and wait to attack the player. The combat is fast and simple requiring only one d6 to determine success or injury. The game is divided into 3 missions, each with their own objective.&#10;&#10;During this short 20 minute adventure the player is tasked with shutting down the security robots, locating the deceased operative who failed HIS attempt, destroying the Alien nest of eggs, and finally escaping!&#10;&#10;More and more enemies appear the further the player progresses, but there is Battle Armor hidden in the Lair to even the odds - but is it worth the detour?&#10;&#10;This is a light print and play game which requires very little paper and not much cutting. Players will need to provide their own token to mark their location and a six-sided die.&#10;&#10;"

The rules refer to a board, but a diagram on page 4 shows that it is very basic, essentially a square enclosing two diagonals. One diagonal is for the vehicles and the other for the pedestrians.&#10;&#10;Rules are included for four different games using the set. The first is a suit-following game. One player places one of the four vehicle or pedestrian cards on the appropriate space. Everyone else must either follow suit, pass, or play a Stop card on top of the pile. The next player must pass or play a Caution card on one of the other three spaces. Then a Go card must be played, and the player after the one placing go leads off the new suit in the location designated by the Caution/Go cards. The policeman card allows a player to stop the play in the current suit and immediately start a new suit in its proper location. The first player to empty his hand wins the round and each other player is penalized for the values of the cards still held. A game is four rounds, with lowest total points winning&#10;&#10;The rules do not specify a publication date, but the box has a &quot;Patent applied for 9963/38&quot;, which suggests a 1938 publication date. The clothes on the people in the illustrations scream the 30's. Also, Zebra Crossings were introduced to Britain in the 30's and this game may have been published to take advantage of the interest in such things. Indeed, the rule book notes that this was one of a series of &quot;Road Sense&quot; games being published as &quot;a splendid means of encouraging thought in road usage&quot;, adding that &quot;Police Chiefs, Local Authorities and Safety First Associations, etc., recommend this series of games.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

However, don&rsquo;t be fooled by the simple objective! You will be tested in many ways, and perhaps if you make smart moves and think strategically then you will emerge victorious. Accomplishing the objective will be much harder than it seems, especially since you are racing against opponents that have every reason to prevent you from reaching your objective so that he or she may win the game. Think you are winning big time? Seconds later you are losing horribly. Got a strategy you think works every time? Not so much. Prepare for excitement and disappointment, structure and disarray, this is Organized Chaos!&#10;&#10;Everyone starts the game with one card in their hand. A token marks each players draw pile because it is very likely that one or more may end up face up at some point in the game. During a turn a player draws one card, giving them two in their hand. Each card has two sides, each with a different ability. The player may choose which card to play and which side of the card to invoke. Most cards have a side that is offensive and one that is defensive. For example, the most common type of card has Burn on one side and Refresh on the other. Burn allows you to choose an opponent and they must &quot;Burn&quot; or place the top X cards from their draw pile directly in their discard pile. Whereas, Refresh let's you take the top X cards from your discard pile on the bottom of your draw pile in any order.&#10;&#10;There are also special cards that let you do things like flip yours or an opponents draw pile face up so everyone sees what their next card will be, another that lets you switch your entire deck with one of your opponents. There are several other cards that do similarly things to turn the game upside down.

With civil war looming as a near inevitability, the challenge was to find a way forward after years of degenerating political discourse in the increasingly divided American electorate. In the end, after months of contentious campaigning between four (!) major parties and over a dozen smaller ones, the election was won by the Republican dark horse candidate, a little known Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln who hadn't even been the first choice of his party's senior leadership.&#10;&#10;Divided Republic is a card driven two to four player game representing the last calm before the storm that was to become the American Civil War. Players represent the four major parties (Constitutional Unionists, Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Democrats) and attempt to win the presidency by defeating their opponents with dirty tricks, platform speeches, and the manipulation of key historical events. All the while, President Buchanan interferes, radicals riot, and the country continues the downward spiral toward civil war. If one party wins the election by achieving the necessary 152+ electoral votes, or wins in the case of an electoral tie thrown to the US Congress, history may well change. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that the population of South Carolina will finally explode into open rebellion and secede, ending the game, at which point everyone loses!&#10;&#10;This is a light to medium weight game with intense player interaction, card-driven play, and a play time of about 2-3 hours depending upon how events proceed. There are even a few laughs along the way as the mudslinging between parties heats up. Literally anyone can win - it's not simply a cut and dry Republican victory. This is a different kind of US election game, a game where there are not two, but four parties, set in a period when candidates did not generally campaign for themselves, and run in an era when the Republicans were still liberals and the Democrats were the vanguard of traditional American conservatism.&#10;&#10;"

There are numerous cards such as, Press Report, Disciplinary Hearing, Result, that sort of thing.&#10;The idea is to buy players who are good in the Division you are currently in, and improve the team's performance. The track on board is octagonal and six sides relate to week-days and two sides relate to Saturday morning and afternoon. On that afternoon you collect gate receipts when you pass the square designated for that purpose. This improves as you rise up the divisions. Also in this section, you can choose to earn 1 point for your match (the game was a draw) or you can purchase a Result card and take your chances.&#10;The designers were two British footballers, quite well-known.&#10;&#10;"
