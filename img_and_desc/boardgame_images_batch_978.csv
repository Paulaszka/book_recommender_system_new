Initially designed to remain within the 35,000-ton Washington Treaty limit, the final displacement was just over 40,000 tons. As well as being good-looking ships, the Littorio-class included a number of new features including high-velocity guns. They were probably the first of the &lsquo;fast battleships&rsquo; that would come to dominate capital ship design in the late 1930s and onward.&#10;&#10;Vittorio Veneto saw extensive service in World War Two, participating in the Battles of Cape Spartivento in November 1940 and Cape Matapan in March 1941. Though struck by a torpedo at this latter engagement and again later courtesy of a British submarine, she would escape unscathed from the British raid on Taranto of November 1940. 1941 and early 1942 was spent attempting to attack British convoys en route to Malta, until fuel shortages forced the end of such activity. In the armistice of 1943, she was surrendered to the Allies after Italy withdrew from the war, spending the next three years under British control in Egypt. Thereafter she was allocated to Britain as a war prize and was scrapped.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The term Mare, which in Latin means &quot;sea&quot; was erroneously applied to such features by telescopic observers of the 17th century who mistook them for actual seas. In actuality, Maria are huge basins containing lava flows marked by craters, ridges, faults, straight and meandering valleys called rilles and are devoid of water. Maria are the largest topographic, dark and relatively young features on the Moon. Together with the bright, heavily cratered and very old lunar Highlands (Latin: Terrae), they form the landscape of the Moon. Maria are less reflective than the Terrae and can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. Back in the days, the Apollo program, led by NASA, brought back many samples of lunar rock and soil material. It proved that among other minerals and elements, Maria are to be rich in Iron, Titanium, Magnesium and Silicon. Even three new minerals were discovered on the Moon and named Armalcolite, Tranquillityite and Pyroxferroite. Since then, besides being a research object, the Moon becomes increasingly, a point of interest to many of Earth's public and private companies, which perceive it as their next source for acquiring and extracting resources in the future ...&#10;&#10;... in Luna Mare: Mineralis &amp; Dominatio game, players compete in collecting elements discovered on the surface of the Moon with aim to discover additional, valuable, new resources and minerals. In addition to gathering resources they also fight for control over Maria to establish a rewarding Moon dominance.&#10;&#10;Gameplay introduces and smoothly combines 2 core mechanics of pick up &amp; deliver and area control in a single game. Together with light combat, score rivalry, units and cards management or team play, it provides a deep, tactical experience.&#10;&#10;2 to 3 players may compete with each other in multiplayer games. Also, 4 players may play the game by being divided into 2 teams of 2 players. Playing cooperatively team members compete with the opposite team.&#10;&#10;The game is based on a strong, realistic theme. Included map represents quite real boundaries of the lunar Maria seen from the Earth, as well as the Apollo landing positions. Also elements and minerals with their names, amount and composition are based on real discoveries, research and available publications.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;TWO GAMES IN ONELuna Mare: Mineralis &amp; Dominatio is a single board game that consists of 2 separate gameplay modes and experiences - Mineralis and Dominatio.&#10;&#10;Although sharing the same goal concept, each gameplay mode offers different mechanics ratios and ways of playing the game, forcing players to adapt their skills and tactics. Mineralis focuses more on a pick up &amp; deliver mechanics with a support of an area control. While Dominatio strongly prefers an area control with a complementary assistance of a pick up &amp; deliver.&#10;&#10;Besides using the same, basic gameplay mechanics and components, both modes also introduce their own, unique features. Mineralis has its element delivery and new resource discoveries. Dominatio, on the other hand, provides a constant fight for domination over the most valuable regions and elements.&#10;&#10;Each mode comes with a dedicated map, rulebook and a few additional, individual components.

The subject of this small two-player card game is America's Quasi-War with France, viewed through the lens of factional conflict within the Federalist Party. One player assumes the role of the supposedly obnoxious and disliked President John Adams, and is opposed by that ten dollar founding father without a father, Alexander Hamilton.&#10;&#10;The players purchase cards from a market, play those cards in front of them for influence in three categories - Politics, Military, and Opinion - and activate those cards for special effects. Political influence comes easier for a veteran intriguer like Hamilton than for the somewhat guileless Adams. Each player has an advantage within their preferred branch of the Military - Navy for Adams and Army for Hamilton. Opinion allows players to wage a war of words, usually by discarding enemy cards that have not had their powers activated.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to best your opponent in at least two of these categories when the Coup of 18 Brumaire brings the Quasi-War to a close. But there's one more wrinkle: your score across these three categories must also best that of the non-player Thomas Jefferson, who has been quietly accumulating power and influence while you and your opponent are tearing each other apart. Beat Jefferson and you (or your preferred candidate in Hamilton's case) win the election of 1800. Come up short and Jefferson wins. This historical result is the most likely, but with skill and a little luck, you can defeat your opponent with enough strength intact to secure ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Players must contend with the effects of plague, tax rebellions, slanderous pamphleteers, and events from abroad. From the Haitian Revolution to the Battle of the Nile, from George Washington to Napoleon Bonaparte, this short little game with a tiny deck captures the chaos and flavor of a fascinating era in American history.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

It is played on the spaces (squares) of a 10x10 square board. At the start of the game, white partisans are placed on the a4, g1, d10 and j7 squares, and black partisans are placed on a7, g10, d1 and j4. Additionally, each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color outside the board.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayWhite plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, move a partisan of your color to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;Then, place a stone on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the partisan was moved, with no enemy pieces in between along that line. This is called shooting.&#10;&#10;Note that partisans can move and shoot over friendly partisans and stones as well as over empty squares.&#10;&#10;To compensate for the advantage of moving first, White is not allowed to shoot on their first turn, but they must still move a partisan.&#10;&#10;If you have no moves available on your turn, you lose.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesPartisans is based on Amazons, a game designed by Walter Zamkauskas in 1992.&#10;&#10;"

They have to make decisions that do not only depend on the state of the pastures, but also on daily challenges related to life in the steppe. At times, it makes sense to invest money and buy extra fodder; at others, sheep have to be sold at the market; and sometimes, cooperating with your neighbours is the best choice.&#10;&#10;The players&rsquo; goal is to obtain as many animals and as much cash as possible. In the end, it will be seen whether this is best achieved by exploiting the lands or through considerate resource utilisation.&#10;&#10;The players possess livestock herds, monetary resources, rangelands, and their own labour force which is expressed in action points. Not all pastures on the board are equally productive: fertile grasslands, as well as barren steppes, provide the dietary staples for the animals, and both are easily exhausted. Herd mobility is therefore vital.&#10;Moreover, the players have various options for action so they can persist in the face of external adversities and prevail against the others. At the market, they may buy fodder, sell part of their livestock, or purchase additional animals. Development cards open up new options and alternative income sources.&#10;&#10;The challenges faced by nomads are considerable. Year after year, they have to cope with different types of unexpected events. Recurrent external influences, whether local (drought, snowstorms, illness, legislation) or global in nature (price increases in animal fodder), determine their scopes of action. Only those who are flexible enough will prevail in the world of NomadSed.&#10;&#10;NomadSed is entertaining and instructive all at once. Current problems that are faced by nomadic societies across the globe have been adapted into a game which offers insights into a unique subject matter. It has successfully been used in schools and universities to delve into the complex social-ecological conditions of land use in drylands. &#10;The board game can be borrowed for educational purposes in an easily transportable version whose design has been registered.&#10;The game was jointly developed in the context of the DFG-funded Collaborative Research Centre 586 &lsquo;Difference and Integration&rsquo; in cooperation between the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research &ndash; UFZ Leipzig, the University of Leipzig, and the Berlin University of the Arts.&#10;&#10;"

Players play stronger cards than each other to win the game by getting rid of their hand.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are two types of card ranks: numbers and colors (symbols).&#10;&#10;At the start of a game, whether you are playing for numbers or colors hasn&rsquo;t yet been decided. If the subsequent card has a stronger number, you play by numbers, and if it is a stronger color, you play by colors. If you play a card with stronger number AND color, the rule remains undetermined, and the next player will have options to choose.&#10;&#10;To win, it is important to plan ahead and take control of the dynamic card strengths.&#10;&#10;&#10;Ambiente Abissal is a shedding game for 2 or 3 players, which is to say the first person to play all cards from their hand will be the winner of a round.&#10;&#10;The cards used in the game vary by player count, but there are an equal number of card ranks and suits, and each of these give the players a way to rank cards.  That is, if a person plays an Orange 2, it could be beat by any higher ranked card (number) or any card of a higher suit (color).  In addition to playing one card, the first player could play 2 cards (of the same number or same suit), which can be beat in similar ways.&#10;&#10;Play continues around the table with players playing 1 or 2 cards to beat the current high play or passing.  Once all but one player has passed, the current trick ends and the last player to play begins anew.&#10;&#10;Once a player has played all of the cards from their hand, they will earn points, and when a player has earned a given sum of points, they are determined to be the winner.&#10;&#10;"

And also for Alfonso X, Maim&oacute;nides, Wallada, B&eacute;cquer, Teresa de Jes&uacute;s&hellip;!&#10;&#10;In this new &Ntilde; game (the fourth in the series), the players have to combine cards correctly with the aim of acquiring more points than their opponents before everybody has played their hand. There are five types of cards: 1) &lsquo;Character cards&rsquo;, 2) Object cards, 3), Scenario cards, 4) League cards, and 5) Action cards.&#10;As is the case with Mahjong, there are special card combinations that add up points (&lsquo;Character&rsquo; + &lsquo;Object&rsquo;; &lsquo;Scenario&rsquo; + &lsquo;Character&rsquo;; or according to &lsquo;Work&rsquo; or &lsquo;Author&rsquo;). There are also card combinations like &lsquo;Heroines&rsquo;, (Benina, Teresa or Esperanza), or &lsquo;Villains of Literature&rsquo; (Do&ntilde;a Perfecta, Bernarda Alba). The value of each card is determined according to the &lsquo;&Ntilde; value&rsquo;, (main value), &lsquo;Wisdom value&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Strength value&rsquo;. Unless an &lsquo;Action card&rsquo; specifies otherwise, the &lsquo;&Ntilde;&rsquo; value is the one that should be used to score points.&#10;&#10;During the game, players have to take turns choosing cards that allow them to score or undermine their opponents. The cards can be found in four different states of play: 1) in the players&rsquo; hands (each player receives a set number of cards at the start of the game), 2) on the table (visible to all players), 3) in the scoring area of each player, or 4) out of the game (used cards). Cards in the hand or on the table can be used to score points, while cards in the scoring area of the players or among used cards are irrevocable, meaning that they can not be placed in another area.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

As your Doomlings assert their dominance, Catastrophes will befall the planet, causing setbacks for each competing species.

There are opportunities to increase your Gene Pool (hand size), which can give your species a leg up by providing a larger pool of Traits to select from each turn.&#10;&#10;A lightweight card game for 2-6 players, Doomlings can be played casually amongst friends, or competitively by the gaming enthusiast family.

In this 2-player, 3-hour game, the blue team is the Federals, agents of the government in Washington. The red team is the Rebels, militia groups trying to seize control of states, highways, and cities. The conflict spreads across the entire continental US, from Miami to Seattle and from Los Angeles to New York.&#10;&#10;Two scenarios are presented. One depicts a rebellion that emerges from rural areas in the Midwest and South. The other puts the rebellion in urban areas along the coasts. As such, the game is open to multiple interpretations of future politics in the US. The game was designed not to make political statements of one kind or another, but rather to accurately model counter-insurgency operations in the continental US, regardless of who the rebels happen to be.&#10;&#10;Many of the game mechanics are familiar from the existing body counter-insurgency sims. The resources and operations available to the two players are different; the insurgency is depicted as an asymmetric conflict. Gameplay is card-driven, however with events depicting situations that may arise in the US context. For example, if a civil war to occur, the Supreme Court is likely to make rulings that affect the conflict. Therefore, there are SCOTUS cards involving the Second Amendment and the government&rsquo;s ability to make arrests. Other uniquely American features include truck stops as information networks, police brutality events, and the sports-entertainment complex.&#10;&#10;While some of the game&rsquo;s mechanics are familiar, 2040 brings many new mechanics to the table. For example, there is a fully fleshed-out social media system that affects the power of the rebellion. The Rebel player does his recruiting and fundraising through the internet, so that Federal online control measures can dramatically reduce the Rebel&rsquo;s money and troop levels. This net-based conflict adds a third dimension to the insurgency, one that has not been extensively modeled in previous commercially-available simulations.&#10;&#10;Another noteworthy feature, unique to the US, is that the suburbs and central cities of an urban area can be at diametrically opposite poles of the revolution. This creates a difficult strategic problem, in that operations that pass between two urban cores must necessarily go through the suburbs of both cities along the way. If those suburbs are enemy-controlled, the transit may be blocked. Forces inside cities can effectively be trapped by hostile suburban forces. Thus, the suburban / urban political conflict in the US has important implications for operational effectiveness.&#10;&#10;The game components include a 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map of the continental US, broken down by regions, cities, suburbs, and highways. Wooden pieces represent Militias (red) and Federal Security Agents (blue). Counters are used to indicate the status of a given space, from Order (pro-Federal) to Revolt (pro-Rebel). Each player has a Player Aid that summarizes the possible actions of both players.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;    Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;    Solitaire suitability: 8 out of 10 (similar to games like Twilight Struggle)&#10;    Time scale: Not specified, but approximately one year per turn, covering a 4 to 5 year conflict&#10;    Unit scale: one unit = paramilitary cell&#10;    Players: one to two, best with two&#10;    Playing time: 2-3 hours&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
