The Rollcall deck, backed with stars on blue, contains a card for each state, showing an outline of the state, the cost of campaigning for the state, the number of electoral votes it provides, and one of eight symbols representing different power blocs. The Campaign Deck, with red and white striped backs, consists of five types of cards used to capture states: Campaign contributions (money), Splinter Party, Favorite Sun, Endorsement and Party in Power.&#10;&#10;The state card deck is shuffled, and the first six states are laid on the table. Each player receives a hand of seven Campaign cards. On each turn, he uses his hand to take states either from the table or from other players. Once he has made as many moves as he desires and can afford, he ends his turn by drawing two more Campaign cards from the deck.&#10;&#10;States on the table can be obtained by discarding campaign contributions greater than or equal to the campaign cost of the state. No change is provided. States can be taken from other players by using the other cards. Using Endorsement, a player must pay 1.5 times the normal cost to take a state from another player; using Favorite Son, he pays only the normal cost; and using Splinter Party, he pays only half the normal cost. The most powerful card is the Party in Power, which allows the taking of one state from each opponent for half their normal costs - but the player must take and pay for a state from each player.&#10;&#10;The final element to strategy is the assembly of power blocs. When a player manages to assemble three or more states with the same symbol, he pays $1M per state and places them in front of him as a group. After that, only the top card is vulnerable to attack, and the attacker must pay double the normal cost.&#10;&#10;Once the last state has been taken, electoral college votes are tallied and the player with the most votes wins.&#10;&#10;"

In the game the players try to help Andi tell Mrs Fink about his adventures with his grandma and then tell his mother about how he helped Mrs. Fink.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 8 to 10 rounds, depending on playercount. Each player has a hand of three cards. In each round, the active player flips an apple token from the tree, revealing either grandma (green) or Mrs Fink (blue). Depending on the colour he tries to fulfil as many of the cards of that colour until a timer runs out. To fulfil a green card the player has to roll a certain combination with four coloured dice as fast as he can. To fulfil a blue card the player has to stack the dice in a certain way. Whenever the active player finishes a card in front of him, the next player in turnorder lays another one out in front of him and the active player continues.&#10;&#10;Once the timer has run out the active player has to shut his eyes immediately. On each green card is a word, on each blue card a chore. So the active player either has to tell a story with the words on the green cards or recount the chores he did on the blue cards. He has to do both in order. Each card correctly remembered goes into a scoring pile. Once a mistake was made, the rest of the cards are put away, and the next player becomes active player. After the last turn all the saved cards are counted up, and the group can rate their score based on a scale. The goal is to save as many cards as possible for scoring.&#10;&#10;"

Move, plot and fight competitively, cooperatively or solitaire, in a fast and furious mini dungeon crawler of epic proportions!&#10;&#10;Each game is played on a five-by-five grid of dungeon room cards, randomized before every game. Players start by choosing their Heroes and placing their tokens in the corner rooms of the dungeon. Each Hero comes with their own set of four double-sided Action Cards placed on the table in front of the player.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you will use two of those cards, performing Actions like attacking monsters (but not other Heroes), searching through rooms, moving or preparing for the next rounds. After using an Action Card, you will flip it to the other side, featuring a different Action.&#10;&#10;Each Action can be boosted by using the Boon effects from any number of Fate Cards from your hand. Fate Cards are drawn from a common Fate Deck at different points of the game (usually when using the Prepare Action). But Fate Cards can also be used for their alternative Bane effect, which allows you to move monsters, make unexpected changes to the layout of the labyrinth, or snatch treasures from other players.&#10;&#10;Each turn will end with the active player drawing one Fate Card for its third and final effect: monster spawn and movement. This is also the time when most monsters will be able to attack the Heroes, dealing damage some of which can be easily soaked, while other have to be placed on their Action Cards, making them unavailable until the Hero is healed.&#10;&#10;"

Each round you will gather a new pack of 7 lovable pups. You must groom them for success by bidding on how well you think they can perform at the show. After everyone has placed their bids the action begins as the pups start facing off! If your pups can win the number of showdowns you bid before the round ends you will earn the reward treats. But watch out&hellip; if you miss your bid you must gain the penalty poos. The player who can collect the most treats is the winner!&#10;&#10;Pups is a lighthearted twist on classic trick-taking card games. 45 vibrant and adorable illustrations make up the deck in Pups and these cards are split between 5 unique suits: Lap dogs, Working dogs, Guard dogs, Family dogs and Mutts as a unique fifth suit. Combine a Mutt card with any other suit in the game to increase its value!&#10;&#10;Players place their bids each round by picking a bid card from the center of the table. The 1, 2 and 3 bid cards are all double sided, with one side displaying a safer &ldquo;At Least&rdquo; bid, and the other side displaying the more difficult (but more lucrative) &ldquo;Exactly&rdquo; bid.&#10;&#10;Pups is a fun and thoughtful game that is easy to learn for both gamers and non-games alike. It was designed to introduce a new generation to the fun of trick taking games while proving unique and challenging to veterans of the genre.&#10;&#10;"

A motley assortment of Indians, Australians, and Brits are trying to hold Singapore and Malaya against the Imperial Japanese war machine.&#10;&#10;Clever fatigue rules simulate the mounting exhaustion and dread. Nuanced air rules-- that's right, baby!, Air rules!-- and the assignment of tank and anti-tank assets deftly emphasizes their importance in modern warfare. The Commonwealth is in a desperate situation, but the game's just as tough for the Japanese, who must win a total victory, or no victory at all. It's WW2 gaming at its finest, and it's coming in the sixth issue of Yaah! Magazine.&#10;&#10;The game uses 84 counters, one 11x17 inch map of Malaya, and an 8.5x11 inch inset map of Singapore. Extensive designer's notes and historical background material is provided as well.&quot;&#10;&#10;"
