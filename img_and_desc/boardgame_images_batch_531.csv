The object of the game is to collect trade tokens which are acquired by moving from space to space along a track on the map as directed by the roll of a die.  Some of the trail squares have further instructions like &quot;miss a turn&quot; or &quot;lose a token.&quot;  Each player also begins with &quot;life&quot; tokens which can be lost along the way.  Lose all 3 and you are out of the game.&#10;&#10;The unique feature of the game is that it lasts for exactly 23 minutes so a timer must be provided.  The amount of time represents 5 seconds for each year from A.D. 793 to 1066.  This obviously makes for a very fast game.&#10;&#10;The drawback of the game is that the movers and tokens and die as well as the timer must be provided by the players.  They can use buttons or coins or parts from other board games.&#10;&#10;
