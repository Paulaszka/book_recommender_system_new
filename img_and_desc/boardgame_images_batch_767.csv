Players take on the roles of China, the United States, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  They simulate current political tensions through card play and structured negotiation keyed to real world events in an effort to &quot;move the needle&quot; to their side.  Unfortunately, the cards with the greatest chance of moving that needle, such as Chinese Coast Guard and U.S. Freedom of Navigation Exercise, are also most likely to trigger armed conflict.  If and when that happens, play transitions to traditional hex-and-counter format on a map scaled at 45 nautical miles (nmi) per hex and turns of 3-7 hours.&#10;&#10;SCS is derived from Breaking the Chains (BtC), but is definitely a different game.  How do the two differ?  SCS begins with political turns that can lead to victory without armed conflict.  For armed conflict, SCS focuses more closely on the South China Sea (45 nmi per hex) rather than the larger southeast Asian region of BtC (70 nmi per hex) and uses smaller units such as air squadrons, ship pairs, and land battalions.  Therefore, the SCS map shows more detail, but less territory.  SCS employs streamlined versions of BtC's turn structure and strike mechanisms that expedite play by dispensing with numerous cycles and strike paths.  SCS nodded to ergonomics by putting all scores on one side of each counter &ndash; less flipping.  Most important, SCS allows naval units to move more than one hex in a single turn, but includes a mechanism, based on stealth, that enables the other side to &quot;check&quot; multi-hex moves to create a more dynamic, variable, and volatile environment.  This last adjustment allows quick moves at a distance, but prevents close-in ships from &quot;jumping&quot; through the beaten zone of modern anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), 290 nmi in some cases.  And, every turn has the option for a negotiations phase with some structure to enhance political play if desired.&#10;&#10;"

Each of these events will increase the Tension between the European Nations and cause a Crisis roll, a roll modified by both the current Tension and the amount of Alliances that have been made by the major powers of Europe. Eventually, unless Tension is managed carefully, such a Crisis roll will spark the Outbreak of the Great War, ending the game after resolution of the war and a final Scoring.&#10;&#10;Will the strongly Authoritarian Empires of Central Europe hold out against rising Liberalism? Will the Workers combine forces with land-hungry Farmers and marginalized Intelligentsia to oust the ruling Bourgeois, Nobility and Monarchy?

Each player then takes it in turns to spawn units, take two actions for each unit (move, build or attack), constructing buildings that will either give them money (for building and upgrades), weapon tokens (for attacking and defending) for creating more units (for making actions). Players can build in an empty space, so long as they have the resources, however if the space has an enemy building, they can attack+build (redemption!) to create a building of one level higher than that attacked (for the cost of a lower level building). After each player has taken a turn, you roll for obstacles (Meteorites, etc) which can land anywhere and destroy buildings, whilst also being &quot;Redeemed&quot; by players to give them an easy higher level building.&#10;&#10;Each race has their own goal, such as to own the majority of the board, along with a unique ability that aids them in this goal.&#10;&#10;Once a player has reached this goal, they win the game after one more round.&#10;&#10;"

Manipulate the market &ndash; and each other &ndash; using your shrewd bargaining skills to trade with your fellow merchants and collect resource sets to maximize profits.&#10;&#10;Hafid's Grand Bazaar is played in a series of rounds based on the number of players. Each round consists of four phases during which players will take turns bidding on caravans, influence, and customers; collecting goods from caravans; trading and negotiating with each other to collect sets of goods; and selling their goods for maximum profit. Goods are divided into five categories, with five different items in each category. Players can see which categories of goods their opponents are holding by the symbols on the backs of the cards, but do not know the specific item the cards represent in those categories.&#10;&#10;This isn't your typical trading game and player interaction can get raucous and intense as players get creative with their haggling! The player with the highest value of talent coins at the end of the game wins. The marketplace is dynamic and ever-changing.

To do this, they use the elements available on the different sections of the central board. In each round, players obtain one element from each of the four sections over four turns and with these elements players form planets and moons. These then collide with each other, causing them to increase in size, develop rings, form atmospheres, and of course create life. Players do all of this in order to fulfill their own objectives, which like the rest of the elements of the game, are obtained from the central board; at the end of the game, these provide the victory points that determine the overall winner.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;En una partida de Cosmog&eacute;nesis, cada jugador crear&aacute; su propio sistema planetario partiendo de una estrella y un cintur&oacute;n de asteroides.

The game consists of 88 cards with beautiful historical illustrations. No, it is not just a question of placing cards on a timeline! There's much more to it than that...&#10;&#10;The first version of the game is light and easy, specifically designed for families. It's the year 2031: you are one of the very first time travelers and you have been sent to the past. However, your time machine does not work as it was supposed to (isn't that typical!) and you are left stranded in the past. Now you have to get back to the year 2031. Each game round the players must jump into time but the problem is: not everybody will want to travel to the future like you do, some will want to jump to the past. And if you can't place anything on your timeline, you run the risk of being absorbed by the time-space continuum. It's a tug-of-war in time &amp; space. Duration of play: 20 to 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;The second version, The Time Bandits, is heavier and semi-cooperative. In this game lets the players choose between being the secret agents or the thieves. The thieves, sent to the past by a criminal organization, must collect four historical artifacts before the eighth card has been played. The agents have been hired &amp; vigourously trained by the government to hunt the criminals down before they end up changing the past and thus also automatically...the future. All players receive a deck of 18 cards which represent their time machine's battery allowing them to conjure up a wormhole in order to jump into time. The players must keep a close eye on the level of their battery: if it's empty, they will not be able to jump in time anymore and they will end up Lost in Time. Both the agents and thieves can make use of famous historical characters (Elizabeth I, Napoleon or Lenin...) to help them stop their rivals! Duration of play: 30 to 40 minutes.&#10;&#10;The third version is a solo variant. Before traveling to the past, you must decide how many batteries (deck of cards) to bring along. Every leap in time costs an amount of energy and even moreso if you end up in a period of disaster. When your batteries are empty, you are stuck in time, so you must be economical with your available energy! Will you jump in time immediately and save your battery, or will you press your luck and spend more energy in order to find a data chip that will help your travel through time more easily? Duration of play: 15 to 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;Can you survive the past?&#10;&#10;"
