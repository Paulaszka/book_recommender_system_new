For additional offensive and defensive capabilities, the Power Cards help randomize gameplay. And then, there are dangerous obstacles like Terrain Obstacles to worry about, and the SPR-8 Markers are the Mother of All Game Changers for each player. It's like chess on steroids. Finally obstacles like Black Holes and Terrain/Obstacles, featuring some of the exoteric landscapes and flora seen in our soon-to-be-released online comic!

On each turn, you play three cards from your hand to move your ships. Your cards have a basic movement number, and often a secondary action. You may use one or the other to move your ships down the track or gain special advantages.&#10;&#10;Each of the three tracks winds through the Caribbean islands toward your ultimate goal: the Spanish Treasure Galleon at Trinidad. Along the way, there will be detours that lead to merchant ships that may be plundered, and towns that may be visited to cash in your plunder for treasure. Plundering merchant ships and visiting towns also allows you to recruit more crewmen (cards) for your crew (deck). The better your deck is, the faster that your ships are able to move, so deciding when to take detours for plunder and recruiting and when to sail on toward your ultimate goal is an important decision that every pirate captain must make.&#10;&#10;The first pirate captain to reach the Treasure Galleon at the end of any track ends the game. Each pirate ship scores points based on what place they finished on each track, as well as for the treasures earned by selling plunder.

So, for example, the last three cards are a Wargame, a Party Game and again a Wargame, you can call it.&#10;     The second difference is that the game has some scoring: 4 points for being the first one to throw all your cards, and 1 point for each Entrejuegos set.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Its purpose is to show the dynamics and characteristics of the original siege, allowing one to see events unfold in a realistic manner, and thus, understand them better. The game system replicates the siege with the gamer watching events unfold toward resolution as the giant Roman ramp grows ever closer to the fortress plateau...and destiny.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;Masada is a game on the epic siege of Masada in 73 A.D.  You as the Roman are trying to win as timely as possible. The game system replays the siege. The sequence of play is simple as it has an events phase and an action phase. Both these phases involve rolling dice to see what the Roman accomplished or how game events up to that point impact the turns die rolls.&#10;&#10;In the Action Phase, the Roman is hoping that they get to place a ramp. Placing a ramp means the X Legion is getting closer to the plateau where they can assault the redoubt. What can also happen is the result ends up with you rolling on the Defenders Response Table. It's a series of simple calculations - add together the current Supply Index and the sum of 2 dice, comparing it to the current number of ramps placed. If the Defenders total is higher the result is simply no effect. HOWEVER if it is lower - urk...roll another die and compare that to the current Defender's morale Index to get your results.Upon conclusion of the action phase, you end that turn.&#10;&#10;It is interesting to note there is no turn limit in the game as historically the Romans were committed to destroying this last resistance.  Upon placing the 16th Ramp, the siege ramp is now completed and combat now happens.&#10;&#10;First though you roll to see if the defenders commit mass suicide (the historic result) or if there is a fight to the death. The combat phase can last up to 19 combat rounds. Each Roman roll of 6 eliminates a defender, and Romans roll first. There is no simultaneous combat where each side gets a chance to roll before results are implemented.&#10;&#10;The system neatly handles the increasing Roman legionnaire presence on the plateau as each turn the Roman combat value increases by one to a maximum of 19. This means the Roman would roll 19 combat rolls for the final combat round. The surviving defenders roll with each die roll of 6 moves the Combat rounds forward. Each 6 combat rounds the defenders survive results in the Roman Victory Points being lowered by 1.&#10;&#10;"

Counters (5/8th inch) represent individual soldiers that are individually named and rated for marksmanship, morale, melee ability, leadership rank, and weapon.  The map scale is 17 yards per hex, and time scale is between 45 and 60 seconds per turn.  A variety of scenarios enables gamers to conduct firefights between individual squads.  The game was designed for two-players.&#10;&#10;Like all Minden releases, this game series emphasizes historicity and playability.  Games and modules may be freely combined.  The first two releases cover the titanic struggle on the east front, at the smallest scale possible... individual German and Russian soldiers.  The counters reflect the strengths and weaknesses of each army.  Note that players must supply a six-sided die and deck of standard playing cards to play, and the two-sided counters must be cut apart prior to play.&#10;&#10;Tanks?  No tanks!  The Combat Leader system is a two-player game designed to simulate tactical infantry firefights between individual soldiers and leaders in an historically faithful yet highly playable manner.  And yes... more games and nationalities for the Combat Leader system are planned.&#10;&#10;While the Combat Leader game system was designed for two players, many solitaire enthusiasts would consider it &quot;solo friendly&quot; since it is low complexity, there are not many units on the map at any time, and there is some &quot;chaos&quot; and variability built into the system (similar to other two-player games published by Minden).&#10;&#10;Combat Leader: Core Rules is Minden's rulebook for the entire Combat Leader game system. It includes all standard, advanced, and optional rules to play the game. The book also contains portions of game maps and soldier counters to allow you to play sample scenarios. To fully employ these rules, it is assumed that players have access to at least one Combat Leader game, module, or game component set.&#10;&#10;COMBAT LEADER: CORE RULES is a 52-page book containing all the standard, advanced, and optional rules for the system, covering German and Russian soldiers (including rules for Green, SS, Assault Engineer, and Volkssturm squads, and commissars)&#10;&#10;"

As you build your chain of reactions, you'll recreate real-world logic behind addition mechanisms, just like in a molecular puzzle.&#10;&#10;&#10;         HERE GOES A VIDEO-TUTORIAL ABOUT hardcore version!&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;https://youtu.be/BVWY6mEje1M&#10;&#10;You can find the simplest versions in our page.

That&rsquo;s because the game teaches everything you need in just a few minutes.&#10;&#10;https://youtu.be/pWKRF4iICMo?list=PLhdfiv12OleVsMOVvXUmD6pUTlsJlCeIZ&#10;&#10;&#10;     Chemistry is Also About Emotions&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;If there&rsquo;s one thing that drives learning, it&rsquo;s emotions. And few things feel better than completely dismantling a friend&rsquo;s seemingly perfect strategy. That&rsquo;s the heart of ChemiProject.&#10;&#10;To capture that thrill, we introduced BreakRules cards, allowing players to interact in ways that, in real life, might be... questionable.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Real Science, Real Strategies&#10;&#10;&#10;Every reaction in ChemiProject is grounded in real chemistry. Of course, in a real lab, purifying compounds and synthesizing molecules might take weeks&mdash;or even months&mdash;with frustratingly low yields. But here&rsquo;s the good news: in the game, the science is accurate, but the pace is way more fun.&#10;&#10;All versions share the same scientific spirit.

You will write scathing reviews of entertainment properties, spreading vitriol while also refining your unique identity. In other words,score points with cards and win if you have the most.&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;A PAIRS deck and a way to keep score.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Setup: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of six cards to each player. Players will then draft a hand of five cards, because all good games start with a draft.&#10;&#10;The Draft: &#10;From your starting hand of six, choose one card to keep, and pass the rest to the player on your left. Keep your selected cards on the table in front of you. You will do this five more times, but rather than passing the last card, you discard it.&#10;Each player should now have a five-card hand. With this hand you will now play five rounds.&#10;&#10;Each Round:&#10;You will play cards trying to score points. The highest unique card wins each round.&#10;&#10;First, deal one card from the deck face-up into the center of the table. This card represents a new entertainment property that some group of misguided fools have poured their hard work and time into, but which is an insult to all true fans of the genre.&#10;&#10;Players will then &ldquo;review&rdquo; the property by playing a card from their hand. This play is simultaneous. The number on the card represents (roughly) the amount of spite and vitriol in your review.&#10;&#10;Next, the reviews are scored. First, discard any cards that match the center card or that match each other. These reviews are unoriginal and worthless.&#10;&#10;Next, look for the highest card among the reviews that remain. The highest number wins the round,but the lower numbers also score points.&#10;&#10;If your review was unique, whether it is the highest or not, you keep it aside for points. In addition, the player whose review was highest (not counting the discards) scores the card from the center.&#10;&#10;If all reviews were duplicated and were therefore discarded, the center card is also discarded.&#10;&#10;Winning: &#10;The highest total score wins the hand. If there is a tie, count it as a win for all tied players.&#10;&#10;The first player to win three hands wins the game!&#10;&#10;"
