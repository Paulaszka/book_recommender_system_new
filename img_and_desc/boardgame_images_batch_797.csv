(Because you can never have enough of bizarre.)&#10;&#10;If you are not afraid of monsters, U.F.O.s or anything supernatural, the kids could really use your help. Save them from disasters and look out for enemies while constantly making sure you have enough cards to survive another turn.&#10;&#10;So, in conclusion, Monsters and Kids is a turn by turn strategic card game created by two architects. The strategies range from developing cute illustrations, attractive intro videos, nursery rhymes, dark themes, self-referential humor to deadly aggressive attacks for pulling in maximum people.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The game was launched at November 2017, after intensive testing with different kinds of audiences and revisions.&#10;&#10;The pack consists of a deck with 75 cards (60 of countries with contents and stats, 12 special cards, a card with 60 country flags, 2 cards with shortened game rules), a rulebook and a world map. Each country card has the flag, location and capital, as well as stats like population, life expectancy or gdp. The game mechanics is &quot;turn-based&quot; and the goal is to get all the opponents' cards, which are initially distributed to everyone, forming a stack for each player (upside down).&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of 4 phases. In the first phase, each player places 5 cards in his hand and can play special cards that change the course of the game, such as stealing the opponent's turn, double the winning prize, exchange all hand cards between 2 players or cancel any of these effects. In the next phase, the turn owner chooses a card from his hand, puts it upside down on the table and will have to decide between asking a question about the card to an opponent of his choice (flag/location/capital) or choose a statistic that will have to beat all opponents cards. For the latter, after the turn owner announces the statistic he chose, each opponent will have to pick a card from his hand and put it upside down on the table, to win the duel. This adds suspense, bluff and fun on each turn, forcing the player to carefully choose his plays. At the end of the turn, the winner receives as prize x cards from the opponents hands, depending on the special cards played, the duel type (question or statistic battle) and player count.&#10;&#10;Many educational/general knowledge board games lack the fun and socialization offered by CardsLab. It's an 8-80 trivia &amp; strategy game designed with a simple mechanics that can easily put 3 different generations playing at the same table. Also, without noticing, we are learning much faster than by reading a book.&#10;&#10;CardsLab - Improving Knowledge Through Gamification.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The players take turns performing two actions each, which can be the same or different, and which can involve the same Dino or T. Rex, or not.&#10;&#10;A Diplo has one single goal: eating grass tokens. It moves in a straight line until it's blocked by another Diplo, a T. Rex, the edge of the playing area, or a grass token. In this last case, the Diplo takes the grass token to eat it and immediately applies one of the six effects: birth, T. Rex appearance, Diplo move, etc.&#10;&#10;The T. Rex has one single goal: scaring the Diplos away. The movement rules for the T. Rex are the same as for the Diplos'. When it meets a Diplo, the T. Rex is placed on the Diplo's space, and the Diplo is placed back into its owner's pool.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no grass tokens remain in the playing area. The player who has eaten the most grass wins. A game can also end when a player has no Diplo of their color in the playing area.&#10;&#10;"

The aim of the game is to publish your newspaper editions earlier than other players thus gaining the trust of your audience and of the advertisers and boosting your global presence as an International media outlet.&#10;&#10;In the beginning of the round, news come out in different countries around the world in different fields (politics, economy, sports, culture). Each story is associated to countries with the roll of dice. Players have in their disposal a Press team and send its members to cover some of the stories, by interviewing people and getting their news copy back in the paper. &#10; Each edition is divided in 4 blocks (newspaper columns) and has to cover at least 10 content points which derive from the news pieces that journalists bring back or, later in the game, from advertisements. Once the edition content is complete, the paper goes to the editors while journalists are free to get some more news stories from around the world.&#10;&#10;After the editors have checked your story, the copy moves on to printing and is published. Its time to collect money, to pay your Press team and to hire better journalists, or more editors or printers to get your next edition even faster. Remember, the competition in the media is fierce and if you lose time the other media outlets will get your story out and it will then be worth nothing to you or your audience.&#10;&#10;Based in the queuing theory, Newsroom is an easy to learn but hard to master worker placement- economic management game where speed and effectiveness determine the winner.

In fact, no two games will ever be the same.&#10;&#10;Players can all play with the same faction abilities by playing as &quot;Civilians&quot;, or each player can choose to play as a Demigod - a unique faction with special abilities and Rages. Play as a Warlock, Earth Elemental, Giant, or one of the other unique Demigods.&#10;&#10;Throughout 5 days, players will track their time using a unique and intuitive time track. This track consists of 24 spaces. Each player begins with 12 time before the Midnight Oil ends their day, but through upgrades it is possible to improve Ambition and start the day with more time. Each movement through the city and actions at a building costs time, so plan your route and day wisely. Whoever has the most time remaining in the day will always play next - so player order is dynamic. Once you enter the Midnight Oil your day will end.&#10;&#10;Players move their characters throughout the game board using a one-of-a-kind worker placement mechanic. Your character blocks building action spaces. When you move, the building action space becomes available. Each game includes 9 randomly placed buildings. Depending on your strategy and immediate needs you may want to visit the Butcher to gain Bloodstones, or the Blacksmith to buy gear. You may wish to travel to the Market to make some important trades, or maybe you need to visit the Grand Palace to improve your influence. During all of this, your character is also tasked with slaying the demons that lurk at buildings and playing quests. Slaying demons and playing quests allow a character to gain influence at a building. This is tracked through a dynamic area control mechanic which makes use of a character's energy. Quests are also assigned to 1 of the 5 council members. Each member has specific themes attached to the quest, and at the end of the game, you are rewarded for having a variety of council members showing. This means you must diversify your strategies in order to impress the entire council.&#10;&#10;Each day players will try to improve their engine to maximize the income at Day's End. They do this by unlocking dormant cubes and visiting the Philosopher's Study for upgrades. Spend the Bloodstones you have collected from slaying demons to upgrade your character. Some upgrade examples are: Income (silver, gold, energy regeneration, etc.), and Ambition (more time).&#10;&#10;Your character starts with 18 energy cubes. These cubes are incredibly dynamic and will be used for combat with demons, upgrading abilities, area control influence, and more.

During the game, loyal Captains must rally their forces to defend the Citadel against the emerging threat of a creature from the deep. Think Gandalf rallying the forces of Minas Tirith in Return of the King.&#10;&#10;This is not a tower defense game, but blends several mechanisms including dice drafting (there are custom dice and rolls can be mitigated), tableau building (the player boards are extra large to organize the various cards), and worker placement (in terms of the various buildings your Captain will visit).&#10;&#10;Your Captain&rsquo;s tableau will include soldiers, wizards, heroes, mounts, and wyverns. Some of these characters are for offensive purposes (attacking the Monster etc) and some for defensive purposes (building your resources including your dice pool). During the game player will also complete quests for the King, buy items from the Town Hall, ride a Mount, fight creatures in the streets of the Citadel, upgrade their Captain at the Armoury, visit the Dwarven Grotto for gold, and find helpful trinkets in the Fountain.&#10;&#10;The game supports &quot;true solo&quot; (a solo player need only control one Captain), fully co-op multiplayer against the Monster, one vs one (one player controls the Captain, the other player controls the Monster), or one player (controlling the Monster) vs up to four Captains. All play modes feature long or short variants.&#10;&#10;There are five monsters included in the game (Dragon, Enchantress, Behemoth, Vampire Queen, and Orc War Chief) both featuring &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; sides for greater challenge and variation. The game engine can be further adjusted with Difficulty Tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You are racing your opponent to find your mummies by collecting information about them. This could be the canopic jar, the embalming material, the amulet, or even a death wish. This information is depicted on the cards and these are what you collect over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;However, the main dynamic of the game are the dice. These are all bespoke dice that slow up an opponent or speed you up in your race to collect the cards that you need. They have low, medium or high numbers on them and this determines the range of choice that you have to select cards on your turn. Once found, you can then collect the reward for your found Mummy. The player with the most reward money, wins!&#10;&#10;This family-friendly game plays at a number of levels, from simple enjoyable gameplay to more complex strategies to win! Over time, players develop a better understanding about how to find their mummies in the quickest time.&#10;&#10;The artwork is very detailed and allows for children to really explore the area of Egyptian mummification. They are actively learning about a period of history, without actually realising the information is going in! This is the power of this little card game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
