The very center of the deforested area has been spared as it is host to trees producing smelly durian fruit. The exploiters of the future plantation simply could not stand the smell and left this small group of trees alone. Contrary to the loggers, Borneo orangutans love durian fruit, but their access to the trees has now been cut off.

Cats are unique, befriending the smallest and the largest dogs in their color, as well as other cats.&#10;&#10;Pack o&rsquo; Dogs has two included versions in the rules: the Base Game and the Complex Game.&#10;&#10;The Base Game has a little less strategy than the Complex Game so it is perfect for first time players, younger kids, or when you simply just want a faster more relaxed game. The scoring is based on the number of cards you have in your score pile and the game ends when you reach the bottom of the deck (no reshuffling the discard pile). The score pad is not used for this version.&#10;&#10;The Complex Game requires more strategy than the Base Game. It involves planning out your moves, remembering what cards you know your opponent has, and which cards have already gone past to determine the best card to play. The game consists of a best of 7 rounds (i.e. first player to win 4 rounds ends the game, but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily win the game). The score pad is used to write down your points for each round and tells you which rounds give you bonus points. You get bonus points for winning streaks and for winning the later rounds, so winning that final round could turn the whole game around!&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;Deck of 45 Cards - 4 colors (white, red, black, yellow) of various sizes (numbers 1-10 and a cat, for each color), and 1 treat card&#10;6 Reference Cards - 3 for each player for quick rule reminders&#10;1 Score Pad - 20 sheets with 3 games per sheet (60 games total)&#10;1 Rule Sheet&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
