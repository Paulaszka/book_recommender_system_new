Points are awarded in winter for the most coverage of each region in the park.&#10;&#10;Gain your ground in the park to be victorious in Bosk!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Bosk is played over 4 seasons, 2 playing seasons, 2 scoring seasons -- each one unique!&#10;&#10;Spring&#10;Players grow each of their 8 trees (numbered 1 through 4) on intersections of the grid lines on the park board.&#10;&#10;Summer&#10;Hikers visit, travelling the trails. Players score points for having the highest (or second place) total value from trees in each row and column. 2 points for 1st, 1 for second.&#10;&#10;Autumn&#10;The wind starts to blow and leaves fall. In turn, each player blows leaves from one of their trees. The wind board determines which tree (a 1 tree in the first round) and which direction the wind is blowing. Players choose a tile from their hand of tiles (2 through 8, and a squirrel) to determine how many leaves to blow from their tree. Leaves are placed in a meandering path in the direction of the wind, covering the various terrain squares. Players may cover other players leaves by returning 1 leaf to the supply for each leaf being covered. The squirrel can jump up to 3 spaces in the direction of the wind, cover any sized pile and can't be covered.&#10;&#10;Winter&#10;Players score again, this time for having majority (or second place) based on coverage per each of the 8 regions on the board -- 5 points for 1st, 3 points for 2nd. The highest scoring player is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

The 98 cards in the set include new heroes, villains, equipment, locations, constructs, and features two different approaches to play. The Sinestro side is built around attack and forcing his opponent to take bad cards, while the Green Lantern side prefers drawing extra cards and a strong defense.&#10;&#10;In more detail, players take on the roles of Green Lantern and Sinestro. Each oversized character card has a cost of 9, 12, or 15 and has a unique ability. As they are defeated, the characters grow in difficulty to take down, and their abilities also improve. Players start off on an even playing field with identical decks of cards. They then use the cards in their hands and special abilities to buy bigger and better cards. As the game progresses, each player's deck becomes unique, strengthened by their decisions. Players attack and defend until Green Lantern or Sinestro stands supreme over his iconic rival!&#10;&#10;The DC Deck-Building Game: Rivals &ndash; Green Lantern vs. Sinestro is fully compatible with the earlier Rivals &ndash; Batman vs. The Joker and the Confrontations set. It is also compatible with all other Cerberus Engine games.&#10;&#10;"

The paths all meet in Moscow, where the danger of a coup exists if any of those People markers makes it that far. In addition, three tracks representing the Soviet economy, media and culture greatly impact the overall situation. A card draw determines which paths and tracks move against you this turn, and the number of &quot;Efforts&quot; which you earn that you can use to move them back in your favor (if the Effort die roll succeeds). The presence of Gorbachev himself gives you additional Efforts -- but he is often on vacation!&#10;&#10;Managing Efforts is key to the game, and you never have as many as you want. You can obtain more by calling in the KGB or gambling away your army in Afghanistan and Eastern Europe, and your nuclear missiles, in disarmament deals: a short term strategy that can cost you victory points in the end. You can even abandon your Warsaw Pact allies to win Western goodwill (and more Efforts) as the Cold War comes to an end. Your success at disarmament will depend on how the US President views your policies, making the 1988 election -- George H.W. Bush vs. Michael Dukakis -- important.&#10;&#10;Each risky gambit is aimed at averting a military coup against you, which can end the game suddenly. Your success (or failure) in controlling the five paths of public opinion helps determine how many individual Politburo members are still on your side when a coup plot is hatched, so the better you play the game, the less chance the coup gets off the ground.&#10;&#10;Can you hold the Soviet Union together long enough to achieve a treaty with your restive Republics and win the game?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

One to four players work together to try to keep Little Red Riding Hood safe from the Wolf, and get her to her grandmother's house. If the players can do this in under eight minutes, they win. If they run out of time, or connect LRRH to the Wolf by the paths, they lose.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is similar to the Ravensburger game Labyrinth. A series of square cards are laid out, six between LRRH and Grandma's cottage. Two more rows of six are laid above and also below, making a grid of 30 squares. Some of the cards show a wolf, all of the cards have paths, turning and branching.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player takes one of the four remaining path cards, and inserts it into the grid from the edge of one of the four sides. This pushes all the path cards along, until the final one becomes open, and this goes into the player's hand for next turn. Players cannot insert a card on the line where LRRH or the cottage are sitting.&#10;&#10;After moving the grid, players check to see if LRRH has a clear path to a Wolf, and then a clear path to the cottage. If she is connected to a wolf, they lose. If she is connected to the cottage but not a wolf, they win. If they cannot get LRRH to the cottage before 8 minutes are up, they lose.&#10;&#10;Players can make the game harder by restricting the time available, or limiting the actual game turns, to 16 turns suggests the designer.&#10;&#10;The game was released at the Tokyo Game Market in May 2018 and early buyers were rewarded with a special set of stickers.&#10;&#10;"

One side of the cards show a number from 2 to 7, the other side shows a Japanese hiragana character.&#10;&#10;There are several modes of play. All of them require the players to find words quickly in order to earn points.&#10;&#10;In one mode, the deck is shuffled and placed in the middle of the table. Then, one player flips the top card and places it besides the deck. All players then try to find a word starting with the character just revealed containing exactly the number of characters indicated by the card on the top of the deck. The first player to say a correct word takes the character card as a point and another card is flipped until there is only one card left in the deck.&#10;&#10;At the end, whoever collected the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Play every person for themselves, or divide into two even teams. To play cards into your/your team's bank that aren't already in play, you need to have a minimum of three of a kind or two with one wild card. Once a collection is started for a number in the bank, each player of your team that follows can add as many cards to the bank as they may have in their hand. For example, if your team could not yet collect queens because no one had laid any in the bank, and on your turn, you put three queens in the bank, the next player in your team to play, can add a single queen on top of that pile. Every card laid in your team's bank counts as points for your team, while every card remaining in your hand counts against your team at the end of the hand. The goal is to be the first team to get to 1600 points.&#10;&#10;What's your playing style? Do you hold on to those high scoring cards, never discarding them? Do you play with risky strategy, only banking three of a kind when you actually have five? Will you end the round and catch the other team with handfuls of cards to count against them? This game can get as crazy and entertaining as you make it.&#10;&#10;This deck of 162 cards (three unique and custom designed decks of 54 playing cards including Jokers) will allow play for 2-8 players.

This era saw the birth of the most renowned captains, famous for their incredible feats. Here are gathered the pirates that made their marks on history: some were great fighters or great adventurers, others relied on cunning to reach their goals. Choose your captain and play with your very own deck of action cards to get the advantage. Manage your hand by drawing weapons, items, movement and cannon fire cards. The seas being full of dangers and opportunities, take advantage of the fair winds but beware of storms, the Royal Navy and the Kraken. What will be your strategy? Brutal, quick, opportunistic or crafty? Get the most treasures, and bring them back to the capital!&#10;&#10;In Terre Pirates, a card-driven game, each player embodies one of six famous pirates, such as Blackbeard, Anne Bonny and Bartholomew Roberts. Each pirate has his own deck of cards, leading to different strategies: while some are better at boarding ships, others are good navigators, or focus on stealing treasures from the others. On each turn, you will be able to play cards to move, fight or get treasures, and draw up to five cards from four different decks, depending on your current needs: navigation cards to move your ship, cannons to shoot your opponents, weapons to board ships, or items to get treasures. The first player to bring four treasures to the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;"

A co-operative game for 1-4 players, Sewage Panic takes place inside Brighton's sewer network while the action of the main game rages in the streets above. Survivors must fight, scavenge and craft their way through ever-increasing waves of zombies. Can they survive until sunrise? This fold-out A3 board comes with rulebook, plastic playing pieces, 60 cards and even a bonus game on the back. Limited to 250 copies.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;A co-operative game, players must work together to survive the zombie hordes. Players each get 2 actions per turn, which can be spent moving around the sewer base, fighting a zombie, scavenging for scraps, or crafting those scraps into survival tools.&#10;&#10;Each player has a coloured pawn, which means they can attack any like-coloured tiles (so a red pawn can attack red tiles and so on), so some tactical manoeuvring is required to make the best use of fighting, scavenging and crafting.&#10;&#10;Some turns, players will come across equipment which can be added to what they manage to craft. Other turns an unfortunate event will occur, which can see zombies gaining in number, or survivors being hindered.&#10;&#10;When all players have used their actions, all zombies on the board move one space towards the base, then more spawn depending on how many turns have been taken. The more turns, the more zombies will spawn.&#10;&#10;If a zombie reaches the base then the players have lost. If they make it through 20 turns then mop up any remaining zombies, then they have won.&#10;&#10;NB: If you have a copy of ZomBN1: A Board Game All About Brighton, then you can use the components from that game to replace the standard plastic pieces with this.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Both players select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them simultaneously. The players then look up results on their team sheet.&#10;&#10;The love of football and passion for football begins for many with high school football. Chris Doelle and Michael Wright encapsulated their passion for American high school football in their exciting vision of the sport in Friday Night Legends. Friday Night Legends (FNL) allows you to play historic high school teams of the past with team results based on their actual stats.  The core of the FNL game engine is based on hours of in-depth and meticulous hours of research.&#10;&#10;The game system is elegant in its simplicity that allows you to do what you want to do coach and play games with your local gridiron heroes. Players act as the coach for their chosen team and make all the critical decisions like their real life counterparts do. In a matchup between two players, you each simultaneously select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them.  FNL elegance comes from its years of development, using a system of a few simple die rolls and simple math of the addition and subtraction of results when the players look up those results on their respective team sheets.  Team tendencies in terms of their breakdown in running vs. passing plays are tracked on the simple game day pads. The easy to use individual team chart replicates the strengths and weaknesses of each team. FNL's unique and easy to use system enables you to compare and play powerhouse larger schools against the small &quot;Hoosier&quot; type size high schools. The fast playing time of 60-90 minutes both allows you to play more games in short order while still capturing the fun and essence of high school football.&#10;&#10;Although FNL started out as Texas High School Football, the game's fans started clamoring for teams of their local teams and FNL has started meeting that need.  The game designers responded with adding more teams across the country and continue to meet that demand from game players with the plans to expand their high school football team universe.&#10;&#10;"

Curiously, the inception of this love triangle also marks the genesis of much paranormal activity in Sleepy Hollow. Tales of a mysterious &quot;Headless Horseman&quot; have rattled the community, and the whispers imply that he seeks to head off any engagement to Katrina,,, literally.

In Genotype, you play as his assistants, competing to collect experimental data on pea plants by trying to control how the plants inherit key Traits from their parents: seed shape, flower color, stem color, and plant height. The observable Traits of a Pea Plant (its Phenotype) are determined by its genetic makeup (its Genotype). The relationship between Genotype and Phenotype and the nature of genetic inheritance are at the heart of Genotype: A Mendelian Genetics Game.&#10;&#10;During the game, players get Pea Plant Cards which show a set of Phenotype Traits they hope to produce and collect (such as pink flowers and tall height) in order to score points. Each round, Dice are rolled to represent Plant breeding, which may result in the Traits players are looking for. After the Dice Roll, players take turns drafting Dice towards completing their Pea Plant Cards or advancing their Research.  The Traits produced during the Dice Roll come through the science of Punnett Squares, which show how the parent genes combine, one from each parent plant.  By changing the genes of these parent plants, players can influence the likelihood of rolling the Traits they need.  The completion of Pea Plant Cards via the Dice Draft is the main way players score points.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of 3 phases: Worker Placement, Dice Drafting, and Upgrades.&#10;1) During Worker Placement, players take actions to get more Plant Cards, change the genes of a parent plant, Garden, Research, stake Phenotype claims, gather new Tools, or even position themselves ahead of other players for the Dice Drafting Phase in a couple of ways.&#10;2) Dice Drafting features a couple of interest steps, including the possibility to get first pick of dice, but only for one type of Trait (like plant height), or the possibility to get a pick of any dice, but only after those first picks have happened.  De Novo Mutation Dice allow players to change the Trait of other Dice or gain additional Research.&#10;3) The Upgrades phase lets players spend their Research to gain upgrades that let them work on more Plant Cards, draft more Dice each round, or gain additional Workers to be used during the Worker Placement Phase of each round.&#10;&#10;Players work to match their Pea Plant Cards to the outcome of the Dice Draft and complete the cards for points.  If they've placed a Phenotype marker, they will earn bonus points for every completed card that matches their claim.  At the end of 5 rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

In a battle, you take turns in clockwise order. On your turn you can add a dragon to your dragon flight, add a storm to your storm front, challenge, or pass.  Both dragon and storm cards have instant effects when played.  Some cards have ongoing effects if the they are the top card in your dragon flight or storm front respectively.&#10;&#10;Each round is played either during the day or the night, as selected by the player who starts the round, but some dragon cards allow the player to change from day to night or vice versa.  Most cards have different combat strengths during day versus night and many cards have different abilities in the day or night, so control of the battle may switch back and forth. Play continues until all but one player has yielded.

When spies take a move action, they must announce some information about their location to the villains, who use this to deduce and track the spies. Both sides have the ability to unlock new tools and get access to more dice each round.&#10;&#10;To win, the spies must hack eight times before the villains hit them five times with their weapons.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

You will move along a path using a Carrom style flipping mechanic to determine how far you can move.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players will flip a chip in a box that is filled with numbered squares. The chip must bounce off the far wall and (hopefully) land on one or more of the squares. Your opponent will then look and the squares covered and decide which value you will move. You may choose to move forward or backward on the path.&#10;&#10;There is only one dagger in the game. To capture it, you must land on it by exact count. You may also steal it from your opponent if you land on his or her piece.&#10;&#10;The path is marked with yellow squares which give special events and shortcuts along the path. The first player to carry the dagger and land by exact count on the Taj Mahal is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The clientele of customers is represented by a deck of cards with various Chinese dishes on them. Customers are served one at a time while a 30-second sand timer is running.&#10;&#10;Each order requires a combination of ingredients to make. The board is used for tracking the levels of ten prepared ingredients in the kitchen. To prepare more ingredients, players spend dice in different combinations. All players are in charge of different tasks and all must work simultaneously because the timer is running!&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players pool their money and invest in different options to grow their business: acquire new recipes, upgrade preparation cards, or send out coupons to get more customers. The players must have a certain level of profit by the last round to keep the restaurant open and win!&#10;&#10;The third edition of Wok Star contains new gameplay wrinkles: You can re-roll dice by &quot;washing dishes&quot; and modify dice by using &quot;hustle&quot;.

Place the cards in a circle around the stage, then place each of the playing figures on a separate card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you roll the die, then move your figure the indicated number of spaces in either direction. You then take the card you've landed on and any other card in the circle and you hold those cards near your face within view of the phone's camera. The app reads the image on the back of each card and transforms each half of your face in some way. Perhaps your left eye grows to an enormous balloon, while your right eye curls like a rainbow. If the cards don't transform your face in the same eye, you return them to their places in the circle, with everyone else remembering what they saw on your face. Perhaps they should tell a story about what the objects you saw in the museum and why they made you look that way.&#10;&#10;If you don't make a match, you lose one of your life tokens, and if someone runs out of tokens, you lose the game. If you do find a match, then great! Remove those cards from play. You're one step closer to escaping the museum.&#10;&#10;The app randomizes which cards have which effects each game.&#10;&#10;"

There the heroes will face increasingly numerous and deadly enemies as they venture into ever more dangerous chambers in their quest to defeat a deadly foe, recover a long lost relic, or other bold deed.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Slayer is unique from other dungeon crawlers in that it makes no use of miniatures or tiles, relying solely on the placement of hero and adversary cards to define the space of the passage or alcove in which combat occurs. This makes Dungeon Slayer easily portable and quick to set-up, while still preserving the feel of a heroic quest.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
