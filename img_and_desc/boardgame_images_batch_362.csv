Players then take turns to move pieces in knight's moves, with the slight difference that the pawns may not jump over other pawns. If three pieces of one player form an orthogonal or diagonal line they are removed from the board. The winner is the player who first removes all of their pieces from the board.&#10;&#10;"

Players then draw further pieces from a bag and add them to their puzzles. When a puzzle is completed it is turned over to reveal the colours. Players may then trade pieces between their own and other players' puzzles. The first player to make 3 puzzles of a single colour each wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.&#10;&#10;In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.&#10;&#10;And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Combat Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&trade; print-n-play packs.

As 1918&rsquo;s campaign season opened, the Central Powers had defeated the Russian Empire and dominated much of Europe, yet less than a year later the Western Allies were triumphant.&#10;&#10;The concept of &ldquo;victory points&rdquo; (VP) is central to play of game. Players begin each scenario with a designated number of VP. They may expend them to gain reinforcements and carry out certain actions. They gain new VP as a result of achieving objectives; they lose VP when they lose units in combat. To win the game you must have more VP than your opponent; so play is a balancing act between expending VP and attaining objectives.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player game: one player controls the Central Powers; the other player controls the Allies. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. The map shows all of Europe from London to Moscow and south to Italy and Greece. Each game turn represents two months. Units of maneuver are mostly armies, along with certain elite and specialized corps. There are 17,500 words in the rules. Two experienced players can finish the shorter (historical) scenario in about four hours. Designed by Joseph Miranda.&#10;&#10;The rules cover such things as: mobilization, replacements, unit conversions, trenches, fortified zones, fog of war, railroads, headquarters, air bases, naval bombardment, seasons, neutrals, Bolshevik and nationalist forces, critical cities, psychological warfare, morale, stand-fast orders, shock troops, proto-mechanized warfare, the Poles, the Allied Blockade, alpine units, the USMC, guerrillas, the Arab Legion, and much more.&#10;&#10;S&amp;T issue 261&#10;Reprinted in Command Magazine Japan #140 in April 2018.&#10;&#10;"

English version distributed by BANDAI AMERICA. The game is anime stylized but is not based on an anime (until later versions) it was created by Michael Elliott, game designer for MTG, and also creator of Duel Masters.&#10;&#10;There are six different categories of cards. Each represented by a different Gem stone. Ruby, Diamond, Amethyst, Sapphire, Topaz, and Emerald. Each gem set possesses specific powers, abilities, and types of spirits which are unique to each gem set.&#10;&#10;The game is based around a &quot;core&quot; concept. Each player begins with 5 life which is represented by gems included with the game; also players begin with 4 &quot;core&quot; in their reserve that are also represented by the same gems used to indicate your life total. The goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life to zero, or through &quot;crushing&quot; your opponents deck so they can no longer draw any cards.&#10;&#10;As players receive damage from their opponents actions their life transfers from your life area to your reserve where you can pay for spirits, spells, and nexus's essentially adding a balance to the game; so that even though you may be on the receiving end of an assault you are gaining the ability to respond with a counter attack. Your reserve refreshes at the beginning of every turn with each core you had spent on the previous turn and you gain 1 additional core every turn.&#10;&#10;The game at its base is very simplistic, but as you play in more advanced degrees it tends to have a &quot;poker&quot; feel to it, as you can bluff and certain plays give away &quot;tells&quot; and whatnot, it takes about 45 minutes to play a match (best 2 of 3 games)&#10;&#10;Although the game requires basic strategy, there is a lot of involvement in the deck building process, because your resources are on a differing track from your deck there is no mulligan, such as in MTG, however you only begin with 4 core in reserve so you want to include spirits and cards in your deck that work with your &quot;core&quot; production curve. This concept makes a large portion of the spirits and spells in the game to be very attractive to deck building which makes individual cards very cost effective.&#10;&#10;Battle Spirits is currently on it's 4th edition with the 5th set releasing Sept. 10th. It is relatively unknown because it is only distributed to local hobby retailers and online hobby stores. It is currently unknown when the game will hit the mass market, but is expected to gain high popularity with the younger crowd as the anime will be hitting US airways hopefully in the spring of 2011.&#10;&#10;BANDAI AMERICA will send you a free demo deck (all constructed with cards from the first set) they are white backed which indicates they are not approved for sanctioned tournament play, however they are adequate for casual gaming and can give you a good taste of the game mechanics.&#10;&#10;For more information please see Bandaicg.com/battlespirits regarding how to play, how to obtain your free demo deck, you can also watch videos on YouTube by searching for &quot;Bandai CG&quot;.&#10;&#10;On behalf of the Battle Spirits community, I warmly welcome you to the game! &#10;-Brandon Anderson (Top 8 X-championship GenCon 2010)&#10;&#10;"

Black Prince: Crecy &amp; Navarette (BP) reflects that diversity by simulating two battles, both of which represented a clash of distinct weapons and tactics.&#10;&#10;Navarette is a simulation of the conflict between English and Castilian forces and their French allies near the Spanish village of Najera on 3 April 1367, during the Hundred Years War. The battle marked the culmination of the Black Prince&rsquo;s campaign to overthrow the usurper Henry the Bastard and regain the throne of Castille for the rightful king, Pedro the Cruel. The scales are 50 yards per hex, 500 men per standard counter, 1,500 per double-length counter, and 20 minutes per game turn.&#10;&#10;At Crecy, in 1346, the French knights in Philip&rsquo;s army were the elite of the country, and felt themselves to be the epitome of chivalry. That led them to treat the foot soldiers of both sides with contempt. Thus, when charging, only English knights were worthy of their attention. Also, when their own archers faltered before the hail of English arrows, they saw them as cowards and traitors not worthy of being on the field. The scales here are 80 yards per hex, 400 to 500 men per standard counter, 1,200 per double-length counter, and 40 minutes per game turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Rules cover such things as: rout, plat armor, English longbows, crossbows, leadership and much more. The turn sequence for both games is as follows.A. First Player Turn&#10;1. Rout Removal Phase&#10;2. Rout Movement Phase&#10;3. Movement Phase&#10;4. Fire Combat Phase&#10;5.

A fast and furious take on traditional Rummy! Players race to get rid of the cards in their hands by creating sets and runs in the middle of the table. Don't have the right cards? No problem -- grab from a set or run already on the table, or play your cards on any existing set or run.&quot;&#10;&#10;Part of Out of the Box's Fun to Go series, the tin contains 72 cards: 1-12 in five colors, 9 wild cards, and three draw-3 cards. The entire deck is dealt out, then each player takes a hand of 8 cards from their draw pile.  There are no turns &mdash; players may do any of the following six actions, at any time and in any order: play a set or run, play a wild card, draw a card, add to or draw from a set or run, or play a draw-3 card. A set is 3 cards of one number; a run is 3 consecutive same-colored numbers. They are set down so that each player can see and reach them. When a player has got rid of all the cards in their hand, the round ends immediately. Each other player must then add points to their score for cards remaining in their hands: 5 points per number card and 10 points for each wild or draw-3 card. After four rounds the player with the fewest points wins.&#10;&#10;"

The players have do discover 5 cards of toxic waste before they are rusted through. The rusting progress is simulated on a rust-o-meter by 50 grommets and after each round one six sided die is rolled and that number is removed. If all are removed before the last barrel of waste is uncovered the players have lost.&#10;The gaming area is set up by mixing all brown cards face down including the five toxic cards and forming a 5x6 pattern. On these the yellow action cards are placed face down as well and finally all green landscape are placed on top face up. The game uses a currency of power beans of which each player gets one six sided dies worth each round. These are used to remove landscape cards 10 for a small card and 20 for a big card and players are allowed to pool power beans. If an action card is unearthed it is turned and the required action is read. This action then needs to be executed in order to remove the yellow card to gain access to the lowest layer of brown cards. Once the brown cards are accessible they may be turned without additional cost.&#10;&#10;
