At this time of the year there is a competition, where you have to get and cultivate special plants and harvest their fruits.&#10;&#10;Before each round, the players have to decide which actions they want to take and how much value they give these actions. To do so, each player secretly bid with their hand cards, for the actions.&#10;&#10;For harvesting fruits, you get victory points.

The player who draws the Crow card has to &quot;kill&quot; the other players.&#10;&#10;Each player separates from the other players and goes into hiding, somewhat like hide and seek. However, some players will reveal themselves at times. For example, a character with the Shield needs to pass it on, and so, they will search for others to pass it to. The Hunter wants to be able to observe others in order to find out who potentially could be the Crow. The Crow needs to hunt (seek) the others. Typically the Seer and the Villagers try to hide but also be receptive to finding the Shield. And so, each turn is an interplay between hiding, finding out more information, and finding ways to end the round in their favor.&#10;&#10;The Crow &quot;kills&quot; another player by simply whispering into their ear / near them, &quot;You're dead.&quot; Alternatively, they can say, &quot;You're dead; you're my Zombie&quot; to the one chosen Zombie character per round. The Hunter &quot;kills&quot; another player by loudly saying, &quot;Bam! You're dead!&quot; then revealing that they are the Hunter. No other player has the capacity to kill, aside from if someone reveals to the the Crow when they are tagged &quot;dead&quot; that they have the Shield.&#10;&#10;The other players have to identify the Crow and defend themselves with a &quot;Shield.&quot; Some of the other players also have special abilities to partner with other players, defend themselves, or kill other players as well. The Shield must be passed from player to player every minute and is only way other players can protect themselves from being murdered.&#10;&#10;Rounds can last from roughly 3 - 20 minutes. When a round is over, the cards are reshuffled, the Shield is reset, and a new round begins with the dealing of the cards. Participants can play as many rounds as they wish. No formal score keeping is necessary. The game is adaptable and comes with extra cards for the option of building out custom rules.&#10;&#10;"

The outer edges of the board are also covered with walls.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsTwo adjacent cells, and any pieces on them, are linked if their shared edge segment does not contain a wall.&#10;&#10;A group is a piece along with all other like-colored pieces one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked pieces of its color.&#10;&#10;A liberty of a group is an empty cell linked to at least one piece in that group.&#10;&#10;Similarly, a territory is an empty cell along with all other empty cells one could reach from it through a series of steps between linked empty cells.

After all removals, the following conditions must be met:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Your newly placed piece must be part of a group with at least one liberty.&#10;     The cell on the other side of the wall of your newly placed piece must not contain an enemy piece.&#10;     The current board position, ignoring walls, must be different from the board positions at the end of all your previous turns.&#10;&#10;&#10;Otherwise, your placement is illegal.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession.

Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play.

The board has 10 spaces with a 3 letter word on each.

One die has all Ps, but includes a different number on each face.  The second has either an N or a T.  The third has the five vowels and a blank.  Before the dice are thrown, players bet on which word will come up.  They may bet multiple chips on one word or more.

Ten different Prime Ministers served during Victoria&rsquo;s reign, with varying degrees of success. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to experience Victorian political life, taking on the role of a historical politician. Will you make your mark as a Backbencher? Stir up trouble as a wily Opposition Leader? Or successfully govern the world&rsquo;s greatest empire as Prime Minister?&#10;&#10;In Prime Minister, 1 to 4 players vie for political power and prestige by campaigning for public support, selecting and debating bills, pursuing official appointments, recruiting influential Victorians as supporters, garnering favor with the Queen, and, when the time is right, challenging other players for their leadership roles. Gameplay is partly cooperative with shifting alliances, but only one player can win by holding the Prime Minister&rsquo;s seat at the game&rsquo;s end.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard multiplayer game, Prime Minister includes a dozen scenarios of varying length and a &ldquo;Clockwork&quot; system featuring automated opponents for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Compete to assemble the most powerful Chili Pepper Gangs (sets of cards) and become the most respected mafia boss. In Chili Mafia, you will find existing Chili Peppers from around the world that are the main characters of the game. Just to mention a few, such well-known Chilies as the Jalape&ntilde;o, the Tabasco or the Carolina Reaper clash with each other. To reflect hierarchy, each pepper carries points that are in proportion to the respective Chili Pepper's strength on the Scoville scale.

Your goal is to bring them to Mexico for a peace summit.  As you arrive in the Chihuahuan desert, the spicy criminals jump out of your luggage. It&rsquo;s obvious they have no interest in peace.

The goal of the game is to score as many victory points as possible by the end of the last round. Each round, players take turns in clockwise order, beginning with the starting player. On your turn, you can invite a hero or use one of your settlers to take one of these seven actions:&#10;&#10;1. Construct a building &#10;2. Explore a terrain &#10;3. Hunt a monster&#10;4. Build an outpost&#10;5. Activate a region&#10;6. Activate a street&#10;7. Activate an outpost&#10;&#10;On your turn, if you have the required resources, you may spend them to invite a hero in your settlement. Heroes are useful because they bring you victory points. Sometimes, a hero's score depends on your buildings, terrains, or outposts; some heroes also provide you with extra settlers. You may pass immediately after playing your turn if you're ready to end the current round. If you cannot do anything on your turn, then you must pass.  Take a new artifact among the available ones, then return your previous artifact. Once all players have passed, the round ends.&#10;&#10;At the end of the sixth round, the game ends, and you sum points from your hero cards and buildings. The player with the most victory points wins, and their settlement becomes the main outpost of the land!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"
