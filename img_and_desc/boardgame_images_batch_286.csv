Some have even argued about it. Now you can play it for yourself to see which side would win.&#10;&#10;This game was developed to help cross-understanding of the two different chess systems.&#10;&#10;One side plays with the Western Chess pieces, the other with the Chinese Chess pieces.&#10;&#10;Due to the differences in western and eastern chess boards, both halves of the board retain the characteristics of each side. The number of squares have been increased to accommodate the slightly larger Chinese chess board. A central row on the Chinese chess side terminates at the &quot;river&quot; to merge into the western chess board. Units playing at the central row interface play as per normal but with a termination at the end of the row. Bishops and Queen moving along the diagonal will side-step across the central row to maintain the same colour of squares.&#10;&#10;Because of Eastern initial advantage checkmating with catapults in first move, West starts.&#10;&#10;All usual rules apply.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Western - King - 1 step in any direction&#10;     Eastern - ji&agrave;ng/shuai (General/Marshal) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)&#10;     Western - Queen - moves diagonally and vertically/horizontally&#10;     Eastern - sh&igrave; (Scholar/Official) - 1 step in any direction (restricted to within fortress) (Korean Chess Rules)&#10;     Western - Bishop - moves diagonally&#10;     Eastern -  xi&agrave;ng (Elephant/Minister) - moves in 2 step diagonals (blocked by a piece along its diagonal) (cannot cross river)&#10;     Western - Knight - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; (blocked by a piece along the long side of the &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)&#10;     Eastern - ma(Horse/Cavalry) - moves in 2/1 step &quot;L&quot; ( blocked by a piece along the long side of &quot;L&quot; when in Eastern territory)&#10;     Western - Castle - moves vertically/diagonally&#10;     Eastern - ju (Chariot/Wagon) - moves vertically/diagonally&#10;     Eastern - pao (Catapult/Cannon) - moves vertically/horizontally, takes enemy piece by leaping over another piece&#10;     Western - Pawn - 1 step forward, takes enemy piece 1 step diagonally (1 or 2 step opening move)&#10;     Eastern -zu/bing (Private/Soldier) - 1 step forward (across the river, 1 step vertically/horizontally)&#10;&#10;&#10;Other rules;&#10;Western Chess Unique Rules&#10;1.

The Eastern cavalry upon crossing the river into Western territory, will no longer be subjected to the blocking (horse-leg) rule whist in Western territory&#10;6.

32970,,"Pirogue: The Trinidad and Tobago Tarpon Tournament is a trick-taking game inspired by big game Tarpon fishing in the warm, blue waters of Trinidad and Tobago.  The name of the game references the local hand-made flat-bottom wood boats used for fishing in the shallows of the surrounding Caribbean and Atlantic waters.&#10;&#10;The play of Pirogue will be challenging play and good fun for gamers who enjoy games such as Tichu, Sticheln, Pinochle, M&uuml; &amp; Mehr, Spades, or Oh Hell!  The game will also be a great companion for sportsmen who want to play a card game which couples concentration and skill with the same sense of anticipation and suspense found in a real big game fishing tournament.&#10;&#10;One of the most important things for the first-time Pirogue player to learn is the abilities of the SPECIAL cards.  Each SPECIAL card adds a different and subtle tactical twist to the game.  Some cards even have different strengths depending on whether the card is the lead card in the trick or a following card.&#10;&#10;Unique to Pirogue is the HOOK card.  The HOOK card is a unique trick-taking device specific to the game.  The HOOK card addresses the unpredictability and surprise found in sport fishing while adding another level of tactical play.  The HOOK card also assists in removing the predictable run of the table for the strongest of hands because even the lowest SUITED card is a dangerous threat.  Recognizing the strength of a well balanced hand over what may seem like a traditionally strong hand is an important part of understanding Pirogue play and key to successfully making a bid.&#10;&#10;Also distinctive to Pirogue is linked play between partnerships and individuals.  In big game fishing tournaments, prizes are awarded for both best boat and best angler.  The game of Pirogue is played in partnerships called Pirogues as well as by individual players called Anglers.  Pirogues and Anglers compete in an intertwined, and sometimes entangled, opposition to win Game Trophies that count towards taking home the ultimate prize: The Trinidad &amp; Tobago Tarpon Tournament Trophy!&#10;&#10;"
