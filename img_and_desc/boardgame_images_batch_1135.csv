Russia is far superior in manpower, tanks, aircraft, artillery rockets, and drones. The Ukraine has better leadership and can improve its position with help from the EU and the USA.&#10;Russia gets help from China, Iran, India and others. While the Ukraine player tries to improve the support from the West, Russia discredits western pro Ukraine politicians and conducts Cyber warfare.&#10;&#10;As the Ukraine:&#10;&#10;Survive the Russian Invasion, stabilize and built your army, organize International aid, gain economic and political influence, reconquer areas.&#10;&#10;As the Russian Federation:&#10;&#10;Try to break Ukraine resistance in an early massive assault, keep your army going and reduce losses, delay International aid for the Ukraine, discredit western politicians, undermine the enemy war effort with the help of Russian supporters in the west, gain economic and political influence.&#10;&#10;Leaders have unique special abilities that can give each turn another impact. In addition they can bring bonus to certain cards and thus make card play more effective.&#10;There are leaders originating from Russia and the Ukraine. Other leaders originate from countries, that can provide help to one side or the other. For example Xi Jingpin performs as Russian leader, while Joe Biden functions as an Ukrainian leader in the game.&#10;&#10;Victory is based on winning Award areas. There both players can score Victory points for a Military-, Economical- or Political Victory.&#10;The war continues after 2022, but the game can be won in one of the above patterns in 2022.&#10;&#10;Yes, there will be expansions, that cover 2023 war actions.

This time, our beloved character changes the 221B of Baker Street for feudal Japan to investigate a mysterious theft at the palace. However, this is a case he can't solve alone, and he will need your help to figure out what was stolen, who did it, and where.&#10;&#10;In Sherlock in Time, each player is investigating a crime on their own. You start with a hand of clue cards that show one of four suspects, one of three locations, and one of three stolen objects. One of the clue cards in your hand faces the other players, not you, and you must identify the three symbols on this secret card in order to solve your crime.&#10;&#10;On a turn, place a card from your hand face up. The other players will tell you how many symbols on the revealed card &mdash; 0, 1, or 2 &mdash; match the symbols on your secret card, but not which ones. Place the revealed card on a reminder card so that you can remember how many clues matched, then either end your turn or attempt to identify the three symbols on your secret card. (Remember that you can see the secret card held by each other player, in addition to their revealed cards.) If you're correct, you score points based on how many others have already guessed their secret card; if you're incorrect, you're out of the round.&#10;&#10;The game lasts three rounds, and once during the game you can spend your honor card to learn whether one specific symbol is on your secret card. An unused honor card serves as a tiebreaker, so don't spend it unless you have to. At the end of three rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Once you're comfortable with the game, you can add additional clue cards that introduce a fourth stolen object, which makes the game more challenging.&#10;&#10;Sherlock in Time is a game with easy and straightforward rules which you can extend with Watson in Time. With this game mode you'll get extra assistants with special skills that make the game more fun and unpredictable.&#10;&#10;Will you be clever enough to solve the mystery that haunts the palace and earn Sherlock Holmes' respect?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Your target awaits; a heavily defended enemy facility that must be destroyed, or rendered unusable. But beware, enemy interceptors, mechanical failures, and dreaded flak defenses will test your mettle every step of the way.&#10;Will you navigate skillfully through enemy territory, win over the waves of hostile fighters charging at your bomber group, and drop your payload on target with precision? Will you effectively manage your crew, utilizing their expertise correctly, and make critical decisions under pressure? The mission's fate and your crew's lives depend on your skill, courage, and strategic choices.&#10;&#10;Choose the crew for the appropriate bomber, select your missions and assemble the appropriate mission deck determined by the respective mission. Missions are flown by drawing and resolving the mission cards. Combat is performed by dice rolling and allocating certain ammunition dice.&#10;&#10;But be prepared for the unexpected. The skies are dangerous, and damage to your bomber is inevitable. Can you manage critical systems failures, repair damages, and tend to wounded crew members while keeping your aircraft in the air?&#10;As you embark on each mission, the risks are high, but so are the rewards. Completing precise objectives, minimizing casualties, and returning your crew safely will allow you to bring out the ol' lady for another mission and be one of the best.&#10;Strap in, pilot. It's time to test your skills, courage, and resourcefulness in Through Hell and Back. Take command of your bomber, navigate treacherous skies, and make history with each successful mission.&#10;Good luck, and may the deep blue go easy on you.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The starting player leads a card or set of cards with the same value &mdash; but they can play multiple cards only if the cards are adjacent to one another  in their hand. If cards have been played on the table, to play you must play the same number of cards with a higher value or a larger set of cards, e.g., 2 &lt; 5 &lt; 3,3 &lt; 6,6 &lt; 2,2,2 &lt; 1,1,1,1. When you overplay someone, you can pick up the cards you beat and add them to your hand where you wish, or you can discard them.&#10;&#10;If you cannot or choose not to play, you must pass, drawing a card from the remaining cards in the deck, then either adding it to your hand where you wish or discarding it.&#10;&#10;If all but one player pass, clear the table, with the player who last played leading to an empty table. When all but one person has emptied their hand, the last player loses one of their two lives. When a player loses their second life, the game ends, and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;"

The game highlights the elegance and fun of the GTS at gaming maneuver warfare at the company level. The Saar battle was chosen as a topic of interest because of the size of the forces involved, the limited battlespace and time period, and most importantly, because it pits two mobile forces against each other, both with the chance to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;In November 1944, the advances of the US Army XII Corps and XV Corps threatened the boundary between the German First and Nineteenth Armies. General Balck, Commander of German Army Group G ordered Generalleutnant Bayerlein's Panzer Lehr Division to attack southward along the Saar River into the flank of the US Army XV Corps to stop its advance east.&#10;&#10;Unknown to Bayerlein, the situation of the Panzer Lehr was precarious. While the German division was moving south, the XII Corps' 4th Armored Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. John S. &quot;P&quot; Wood, advanced west toward the Saar River before advancing north. Judging the soggy ground west of the Saar River to be unsuitable for armored operations, Maj. Gen. Wood obtained permission to have the American armored unit's CCB move eastward across the Saar River into the XV Corps' zone, before swinging north toward Sarre-Union. A clash between the two opposing armored formations was inevitable.&#10;&#10;Strike - Counter Strike simulates the attack of the Panzer Lehr Division into the flank of the US XV Corps, the delaying actions by 106th Cavalry Group, the defense by the 44th Infantry Division, and the counterattack by the 4th Armored Division. The game covers the afternoon of 23 November to the afternoon of 27 November 1944. The German commands the Panzer Lehr Division and the American player commands parts of two divisions an a single map.&#10;&#10;Originally published in the 44 page magazine GTS Briefing Vol 1 (May 2023) by Multi-Man Publishing&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 2 hours daylight / 8 - 12 hours night time&#10;Hex: 547 yards / 500 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed full countersheets (352 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One dual-side printed half countersheet (88 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;One 24-page Strike - Counter Strike Exclusive rulebook&#10;Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC player aid cards&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;Note 1: Players will need to provide Grand Tactical Series Rules v2.0c to play.&#10;Note 2: Players will need to provide one 10-sided die for game play.&#10;&#10;"

Players roll a die to (a) select their uniquely-powered character, then (b) move along the 109 numbered spaces on the winding board, and (c) resolve the effects of the various encounters described on the board spaces.  Finally, both (d) the combat system (between players &amp; against the creatures on the board) and (e) actually moving onto the winning space at the end of the trail are both resolved through rolling the same die.&#10;&#10;The Candyland-style board experience has several unique features.&#10;The first 22 spaces are inside the castle, where you are in the &quot;safe zone&quot;.  But even there you are not safe, due to things like space #3 (&quot;Encounter a bandit, you lose the battle return to start&quot;) and #7 (&quot;Encounter a tornado Go back 2 blocks&quot;) and #12 (&quot;Feel unwell, take a rest and skip a turn&quot;).  Finally, right before you exit the castle, you may get lucky and land on #20 which says: &quot;Spin the wheel to draw a weapon&quot;.  This spinner has 16 spaces which award adventurers with a free weapon, such as an &quot;Algae Machete&quot; or a &quot;Fire Whip&quot; or a &quot;Sword of Ice&quot;...unless you get 1 of the 4 &quot;Better luck next time!&quot; spaces.&#10;Space #29 is a &quot;Detour&quot; right before the encounter with the Fire Dragon.  The detour all takes place within space #29, but it is a 10-space run around the terminates right at the Fire Dragon encounter space anyway&mdash;so, no avoiding this fight!&#10;Lastly, space #109 is where the namesake 5-piece plastic dragon throne sits.  Players will lose their turns until they manage to roll the exact number necessary to reach this space.&#10;&#10;Beyond the castle walls, combat becomes part of the game.  Combat losses force players to lose HP (which are represented by AWESOME wooden tokens), and when any player is reduced to 0 HP he must retreat back to space #22&mdash;with 109 spaces in all, and no control over where you land on a turn, this is a LONG way to fall!  You will have access to item cards, but your choices are limited here, because you can hold only 1 card at a time&mdash;the one you have may not be what you need most.&#10;&#10;Other spaces offer opportunities to earn coins from die rolls, or sacrifice your next turn to acquire coins or HP.  Plot cards are encountered every few spaces, and if you land on them, they add both positive &amp; negative effects (along with some thematic flavor text) just like you'd find in Monopoly's &quot;Chance&quot; or &quot;Community Chest&quot; decks.&#10;&#10;"
