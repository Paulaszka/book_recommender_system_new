Each player aims to get their own colour letters into their &lsquo;Home&rsquo; Scrump zone of the same colour. Using typical crossword play techniques, each player endeavours to build words in their own homeward direction.&#10;&#10;The moment a player (say yellow) has entered their own Yellow (&ldquo;Home&rdquo;) Scrump zone, two actions come into play:&#10;&#10;Firstly, the player entering their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone begins to score points immediately, by multiplying the point value of each letter tile placed in the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone by the value shown on the side of their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone grid (1 to 7).&#10;Secondly, this player is now permitted to &ldquo;Scrump&rdquo; up to any two letters from anywhere in the central 15 x 15 board (you can even &lsquo;Scrump&rsquo; your own letters). Any &lsquo;Scrumped&rsquo; letters must be used in that turn. It does not matter if words are broken up as a result of the &lsquo;Scrump&rsquo;. However, it is part of the fiendish plan to frustrate you opponent(s) by scrumping their letters to stop them getting to their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone. By doing this, they cannot score, and they cannot Scrump your letters until they are &ldquo;Home&rdquo;.&#10;Any player reaching the &ldquo;Apex Star&rdquo; 7, finishes the game. All the other players must then deduct from their score, the value of the letter tiles remaining in their racks. The winner of the game will be the player who has the highest score &ndash; not necessarily the player who finishes the game. To player a full match each player must have one turn at starting a game. A match consists of one game (turn to start) for each of the 2, 3 or 4 players.&#10;&#10;"

Instead of moving a piece or a stack of two pieces, you can choose two stacks that you control and swap them. (You cannot swap stacks if the opponent swapped stacks on their previous turn.) The neutral piece can be landed on, and it becomes part of a stack.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone creates a stack of seven pieces, they win!&#10;&#10;"

Essentially, you must make a new word (nouns only) using the last character of the previous. For example:  &#227;&#129;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#147; &gt; &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#190; &gt; &#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#134; &gt; &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#136; &gt; &#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#141; and so on. The game has some other simple rules to keep it controlled.&#10;&#10;Wocha follows the pattern of Shiritori with picture cards. Each card has a complex picture that can be interpreted many ways, much as Dixit does. Players arrange ten image cards so that everyone can see them easily. Reveal one new image card from the deck to start the chain, then race to decide which one of the ten images can join the first revealed card, explaining how the two cards link together.&#10;&#10;Each time a card is moved from the common area to link to the chain, a replacement card is drawn. Each player has four coloured cubes, and drops a cube onto a card when they make a successful link. It is allowed to revise the explanation of the chain by re-intepreting  or re-using earlier cards. If a player can make a convincing argument, they can replace the previous player's cube with their own. The first player to dispose of their four cubes is the winner.&#10;&#10;If a player makes a rather dubious interpretation on a card image, the game pauses and the players vote thumbs up or down whether to allow it. It is important to follow the rules of the word game. So in the example shown on the blog linked below, the start card was considered as &#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134; (&#229;&#164;&#170;&#233;&#153;&#189; taiyou / sun) and the next card as &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190; (&#233;&#166;&#172; uma / horse (there is a horse in the car!)), thus chaining with &#227;&#129;&#134;. Now the current key letter would be &#227;&#129;&#190; from &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190;.&#10;&#10;The new card drawn from the deck is a Matryoshka (&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#171;). That would form a chain from &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190;. Then &#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#171; is linked by &#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#145; (kappa / a Yo-kai, folklore monster). Now that the key letter is &#227;&#131;&#145;, when you look back at that first &quot;horse&quot; card, that vehicle might be a &#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188; (police car). This lets the player bump the blue cube off and place their own.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#10;&quot;Now that you mentioned it, it sure does look so.&quot; Associative skills and attentiveness is the key to this new picto-Shiritori game. The rules are simple.&#10;&#10;Open 10 cards to form the community cards area, and give each player 4 colored tokens. Then draw 1 card from the deck, and open as the starting key card. Now, let the picture Shiritori begin!&#10;&#10;From the 10 community cards, find a picture that can form a Shiritori-chain from the starting card. Found a good card? Call &quot;WOCHA!&quot;&#10;&#10;The caller places the card next to the first card to form a chain, and places their token on the placed card. This newly placed card would be the new key. Now the players have to find a community card that can form a new Shiritori chain from the new key. Continue this procedure, and the one who gets rid of all of their tokens is the winner. But beware! The previously used cards may be reused to form a new chain. When done, the color token that was on the card would be removed and returned to the original player. So act quickly, and get rid of all your tokens before anyone attempts to return them back to

Players lay out supply networks with their planet and spaceship cards. The cards have to be placed adjacent to other cards according to the placing rules. Thus everybody lays out their own supply network and tries to collect planets. A planet can be collected from the supply network if a player builds a new route with the same planet. That means the planet has to be laid out a second (or third or more often) time and then the old planet card(s) have to be taken as victory point(s).&#10;&#10;Every player has got a mission card (with 4 missions) and a top secret card (with 2 tasks). The missions are all the same for each player, for example: &quot;place a planet at the supply network from another player&quot;. This is possible but harder than placing a planet in the own system. It also could hurt the other player but would not destroy his/her whole plan.&#10;&#10;Mission cards are placed open, so every player knows always how much missions the other players have solved. The secret tasks are all different and the players hide them till the end of the game. Only then the players show them and thus the secret tasks could be crucial for determining the winner.&#10;&#10;"

To start a turn, you draw two cards, pick up any cards banked from a previous turn, and take the three cards passed to you earlier by the player on your left. You play or bank cards until you have only three in hand, then pass those to the player on your right and end your turn.&#10;&#10;Attackers target specific locations and earn points for the player wielding them if they're in play at the end of the game. Defenders try to remove attackers so that the location owner scores points for protecting the location. Support cards provide different abilities, such as enlarging your bank or providing time points (which can be used to draw additional cards).

Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.&#10;&#10;A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.&#10;&#10;Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

The British army under Sir John Stuart defeated the French troops of Jean Louis Reynier. Outcome of battle was decided by British infantry attack on bayonets, preceded by effective rifle volley. Rules focus on infantry tactics.&#10;One battalion is represented by 4 counters. The player determines which order to use at any given time. Various types of orders are represented by different icons. After the change of formation, the players put on the board counter with the corresponding icon. The exception is the square - here we use the auxiliary marker.&#10;The battalion can be formed into a column to the bayonet charge or the line to effectively use firepower. The line order is represented by a square and rectangular counters, if a unit was large enough.&#10;The player can detach a company of tirailleurs, which is represented by a separate counter.&#10;The battle of Maida is regarded by historians as an example of the superiority of the British two ranks line over the &quot;classic&quot; three ranks line. This difference is also reflected in the game. Firepower is expressed as a percentage, which depends on the size. In the case of the British army is 100% - all soldiers can shoot. In the French is 66% - efficient fire through two of the three ranks. For the infantry in column formation or square it is always a 20%. In the case of tirailleurs and artillery on counters are given immediately the effect of fire - a morale check and modifiers for distance, if any.&#10;In the battle only two units of the French cavalry took part. They exist in a double-row line and because of the tactics used (rapid charge) can not fire.&#10;Due to the historical course of the battle, the aspect of command is very simplified. One player draws one commander from a pool (common to both players). Units within its range can move, and further order of shooting is determined (inactive player fires first). Of course, in certain situations very big significance is who will be able to move their troops. The drawing is intended to represent a situation where one of the leaders taking the initiative, and another in spite of favorable circumstances behave passively. In fact, all commanders were on the same level and you can not distinguish any leader that was better than the others.&#10;During the movement the enemy can react. Units with high morale have better chance that they fire, and maybe even counterattack. However, there is always a risk that our soldiers leave the battlefield in a panic escape. That's what happened to experienced Reynier&rsquo;s veterans.&#10;During the game, the most common procedure is the fire that causes morale check. Each unit (except for artillery and commanders) has a proper rating on a counter. The test is successful when a modified roll of a 10-sided dice is less than or equal to the rating.&#10;Rule book has 12 pages. Many of the rules describe special situations that can happen during gameplay, for example commander participating in bayonet charge. Basic, most commonly used procedures are very simple. Another advantage is the small amount of counters and a simple overall situation. A challenge for the players is the use of their forces at the right time and in proper order. Experienced players should be enough 3 hours for the entire play.&#10;&#10;"

Meanwhile, the enemy's &quot;progress&quot; towards completion of an ultimate weapon is represented by a proximity track along the side of the pyramid, which possibly increases each turn.  The object of the game is to capture or claim the enemy capital card before the enemy succeeds in completing his weapon.&#10;&#10;No region card can be removed from the pyramid until either one or both of the cards laid atop it are removed first.  Therefore, you will need to capture region cards at the lowest level of the pyramid first, working your way up the pyramid in stages.  Each attempt to capture a region is called an &quot;invasion.&quot; To conduct invasions, you gather various military unit cards from your draw deck (separate from the enemy nation deck).  These units have strength values, while each level of the pyramid has a defensive value.  You have to amass enough strength and the right types of units to attempt an invasion on a given region, and then a roll of the dice determines whether you lose (discard) this entire invasionary force, or save a few, or lose more than expected, and are possibly forced to retreat.&#10;&#10;Along the way, you can capture select region cards called resource centers, and/or you can invade select zones to liberate prison camps.  These achievements not only increase the number of cards you draw on a turn, but also grant you the ability to improve your units strength values, and they introduce tactical developments that give you more dynamic choices in battle, including an Ultimate Weapon of your own.&#10;&#10;"

Each game follows the plot of that issue's Bugs Bunny story, along with obstacles that match plot complications in each story. Both games are for two players; in the 1951 version, players can choose to be either Bugs or Elmer Fudd. In the 1952 version, they can be Bugs or Santa Claus. In both versions, players pull chits to determine the number of spaces moved and the winner is the one who reaches the end first.&#10;&#10;"

They are allowed to 'cleanup' one card before the rest are washed to the next player for the next round. Each round players select one card from the cards passed to them and continue to pass until all cards are chosen.&#10;&#10;Players use the elements they have chosen to create molecules. Different molecules score different amounts of points (as seen on the scoring cards). Any elements that have not been made into molecules cost you points!&#10;&#10;After each round users tally the molecules in their hand.  After three rounds the person with most points wins!!!&#10;&#10;

Their cabinet made that decision based on a report from the Finance Ministry stating the cost of such a move would force them to take the franc off the gold standard and let it float. When the US and British governments, along with those two nations' banking industries, declined to extend the line of credit that would've been needed in order to head off such a potentially panic-inducing economic development, the French decided they couldn't afford to act. The alternative outcome examined here, then, is based on the idea the French either got the loan they needed, or perhaps simply decided the Nazi regime in Germany represented too large a threat to the future of their own republic for it to be allowed to go on unchecked.&#10;&#10;More particularly, the scenario starts with the French having mobilized and marched across the Rhineland, stopping at the river. (Historically, the German forces involved in the remilitarization moved across the Rhine bridges with orders to turn about and withdraw immediately if the French advanced.) The further idea is that, within a few hours or days of the French advance, Hitler and his cronies are either dead, jailed or in hiding, due to a Putsch headed by elements within the German military high command. The Nazi Party breaks into factions and starts to war against itself, or simply falls apart into political incoherency. The concentration camps are soon opened by riots among the prisoners within, or perhaps are liberated by angry mobs from without. Either way, the upshot is that all the earlier-imprisoned leaders of Germany's left-wing parties are suddenly back on the political stage.&#10;&#10;In Moscow, Stalin quickly comes to understand the opportunity -- likely to be brief -- being presented to him. He announces to the Supreme Soviet the era of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; has ended just as suddenly as it began. The time has instead come to forge the iron of international revolution while it is newly hot. &quot;On to Berlin and Socialist World Revolution!&quot; becomes the new slogan of the day. Of course, the Poles resist the effort of the Red Army to cut through their country on its way west.&#10;&#10;Thus, within a month or so after their initial intervention, the French must reconcile themselves to the fact that, having come in for a sou they are now irretrievably in for a franc. As the German army begins to fall apart into warring camps (the &quot;Reds&quot; and the &quot;Nationalists&quot;), Paris sends forward its ponderous Rhineland Army Group this time headed for Berlin, there to create a dictat settlement with a new German government of French choosing.&#10;&#10;The orders of battle for all participants in the game are accurate as to their historic composition in the early spring of 1936. The only Soviet corps left out are the one they then had in the Trans-Caucasus and the two in the Far East. Further, the Red Army purges hadn't yet begun, so three large mechanized corps are available, along with he world's first paratroop unit as well as its largest cavalry arm.&#10;&#10;The first three panzer divisions (all with only Mark I Panzers) start in their countryside training areas, as does the experimental 4th Assault Gun Brigade, which was then dedicated solely to infantry support. The dozen German infantry corps, all of which had historically just completed a rushed year of training (literally and figuratively conducted at &quot;double-time&quot; over the normal two-year cycle), after Hitler's nullification of the army's size limit set by Versailles, are in their Wehrkreis mobilization centers. War and civil war have come early to Germany.&#10;&#10;Sequence of play:&#10;I. Soviet Entry Check Phase&#10;II. French Movement Phase&#10;III. Initiative Determination Phase&#10;IV.

Before the game is announced, the players go around twice to say what their category is, after which everyone's responsibility is to remember everyone else's categories.&#10;&#10;During the main phase of the game, cards numbered one to eight are dealt out to each player.  Whenever a card JUST placed from the deck matches one on the table, the two players whose stacks have the matching numbers go head to head: whoever says something from the other person's category first wins both cards (each category member may only be used once).  There are also a small number of &quot;Rambo&quot; cards, which when played start an all-player race to say the &quot;Rambo&quot; player's category first (including that player).  The winner of the Rambo round gets the Rambo card.&#10;&#10;There are various other rules to ensure that no players reveal others' categories, help other players, etc.&#10;&#10;"
