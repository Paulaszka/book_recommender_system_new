As America withdraws from the world, there will be vast repercussions. In Europe, the international security guarantees put in place in 1945 will be gone. That will mean the old national rivalries that twice in 30 years sent the continent into world wars will reemerge. The scenario here covers Central Europe, where the presumed near-future emergence in Germany of the ultra-nationalist AFD as the majority party ignites fear and loathing in Poland.&#10;&#10;The Poles understand the overarching fact of their national existence is this: if Russia and Germany are both strong at the same time, independent Poland is doomed. Russia is already relatively strong and armed with atomic weapons; it&rsquo;s therefore too late for anything to be done about that.  To the west of Poland, an AFD-run Germany would no doubt soon rearm and become strong. The Poles therefore resolve to act before that happens. They strike into eastern Germany with the objective of taking Berlin and setting up a compliant and friendly regime there. Alternatively, we can also postulate a Poland that continues its own recent drift toward the far right, culminating in a quasi-fascist government in Warsaw. That regime might act in order to forestall a nascent far-right German regime, or it might move against even a moderate-left German regime in order to forestall further Muslim immigration into Central Europe.&#10;&#10;The game uses a battalion-level evolution of the alternating action system from America Falling to model this near-future war in Central Europe.

Georg Zhukov's plan for a preemptive attack against the Germans. The Soviet player is mainly on the offensive, attempting to win the game by seizing key objectives within the territory of the Third Reich. At the same time, though, the situation allows for--and at times demands--the launching of sharp counteroffensives by the German player.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents 16 miles (26 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with a few units of other organizational sizes. Each full game turn represents from two weeks to two months, depending on the season. By telescoping time in that way, the turn-by-turn movement and combat capacities of the units can held as a constant. The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the border area between the Third Reich and the USSR in mid-1941 when viewed at these time and space scales.&#10;&#10;The initial orders of battle for both sides are drawn from the forces historically available to both sides in early June 1941. Similarly, on the Soviet side, the reinforcement schedule is based on what was generated by them during the historic campaign, minus only the historic emergency mobilization of the militia divisions.&#10;&#10;The Soviet player is generally on the offensive, striving to win by seizing important areas on the map while causing heavy casualties on the opposing side. The German wins by preventing his opponent from fulfilling the Soviet victory conditions. Unless one player assesses his situation to have become hopeless, and therefore capitulates to this opponent, victory is only judged at the end of Game Turn 10. There are no &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; victories in this game. Soviet performance in that regard is based on that side side&rsquo;s accumulation of victory points.&#10;&#10;"

Will your teams outperform the others to build the best mining colony?&#10;&#10;Mining Colony is a tile laying game for 1-4 players in which you use excavation cards to compete for resources. With these resources, you develop your colonies and attempt to build science stations and outposts.&#10;&#10;The game is played over ten rounds, each of which consists of three phases: discover, excavate, develop.&#10;&#10;In the discover phase, a resource card is flipped and resources are placed in excavation zones.&#10;&#10;In the excavation phase, players use their excavation cards to compete for those resources.&#10;&#10;In the development phase, development tiles (which are won in the excavation phase and come in a variety of shapes) are placed on the player's individual colony board. The resources, which also include ships, colonists, and crystals are placed in designated spots on the tiles.&#10;&#10;In the competitive game, players score points by creating the best mining colony, i.e., having various resources, people, and ships that are determined to be more valuable.&#10;&#10;In the solo mode, the player competes against a dummy player while they attempt to complete their colony.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Who needs zombies, when you got bugs.&#10;&#10;The game board is made up of two 8.5x11 squared game sheets, each of which has a grid of offset squares on them.  These squares regulate movement and attacks by insects on other insects.  The game mats can be placed side by side, end to end, or can have a series of &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; that allows them to represent restricted spots that the insects are limited in crossing at.&#10;&#10;HOW TO START THE GAME:&#10;1. Both players roll one die, the highest goes first.&#10;&#10;2. The first player places his hive anywhere on the game board marked in his own color.(Typically the closer the hive is placed toward the enemy player game board, the shorter the game will be).&#10;&#10;3. The second player then places his hive, and all of his starting game pieces.&#10;&#10;4. The first player then places his game pieces and the game begins with the first player making his moves.&#10;&#10;SEQUENCE OF A TURN:&#10;1. First a player moves one or more of his colors game pieces&#10;&#10;2. Then he attacks with a single game piece, however this does not have to be a game piece that was moved, it can be any pieces of his color/side. Continue to make attacks, one at a time,with as many of the attacker game pieces that are allowed to attack.  Each game piece can attack only once per turn. The attacking player can make the attacks in any order. A defender game piece that survives an attack can immediately counterattack against the attacker game piece, or another that is within range of being attacked. This must be done before the next attack is made by the attacking side. The attacking side must give the defender time to make the defenders counterattack.&#10;&#10;3. The player then adds a game piece (reinforcement) to the hive entrance (if appropriate) for every food piece returned to the hive during the movement phase.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one of the following occurs.&#10;1. A hive is destroyed. This happens when an enemy WORKER is next to the hive, and rolls a 6 on an attack. The hive is then destroyed.&#10;2. All enemy game pieces are destroyed&#10;3. One side gives up and concedes the game&#10;&#10;"
