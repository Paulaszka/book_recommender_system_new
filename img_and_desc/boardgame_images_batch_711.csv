As the heroes explore, they must use their abilities, buy items, and recruit allies to help them defeat the monsters before facing the powerful Catacomb Lord, thereby saving the town.&#10;&#10;In more detail, in Catacombs players flick wooden discs that represent the monsters and heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, while missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb.&#10;&#10;Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.&#10;&#10;This third edition of Catacombs has all-new artwork compared to the earlier editions, but more importantly the keywords from the first two editions has been replace with iconography, the terminology has changed, and the third edition has new shot types, new card effects, and a different set of components (many of which have changed statistics) as well as wall pieces not present in earlier editions.&#10;&#10;"

Depending on the role you secretly got will help determine if you should lie about your role, though you never have to. After that, players continue discussing until 2 players vote to begin combat. Once combat begins, players may attack each other at any point in time, until someone dies. Every time someone dies, combat is paused and a vote to end the game goes up. All living players must unanimously vote to end and to not vote yes, you have to attack another player, if you cannot then you're forced to vote yes to end. The game can only end in a stalemate (players reveal hands to prove such) OR after a player has died.&#10;&#10;Once the game ends, roles are revealed and winners are determined based on the role's win conditions.&#10;&#10;"
