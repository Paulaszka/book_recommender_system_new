5160,,"Played as the classic Checkers except there are only 7 pieces per player (dinosaurs).  There are two variations on game rules depending on age of the players allowing movement forward and backwards with or without kinging first.  The winner is the first to capture all the opponents pieces or force the opponent in a situation where they cannot move a piece.  The pawns are cute stegosaurus and apatosaurus, the kings tyrannosaurs.  The board has been drawn to look like stone pillars in a sea of lava, and there even are colorful volcano piece-holders.&#10;&#10;"

5163,,"This is essentially 3D Nine Men's Morris with dice.&#10;&#10;The board consists of three stacked surfaces, each looking like a progressively smaller Morris board.  They are numbered from top to bottom.&#10;&#10;The first play phase is placement.  The dice dictate where you can appear.  For example, a throw of one and two allows either one piece on board two, or two pieces on board one.  Placements are mandatory.  You may be forced to pass if no placement is possible.&#10;&#10;Once all of your pieces are placed, you use the dice to move them (the transition turn may feature a placement and a move).  Here too the dice dictate the moves: a throw of one and two allows either one piece to move on board two, or two pieces on board one, or one piece from board two to board one (or vice-versa).  Moves are mandatory.&#10;&#10;As in Morris, every time a three-piece alignment is formed (including vertical ones), this is a Mill and one opposing piece of the miller's choice is removed.  Pieces in mills are protected.  Multiple mills may be formed by a single move.  You win by grinding the opponent down to two pieces.&#10;&#10;The four-player game is a partnership game.&#10;&#10;"

5165,,"A fairly simple and quick deduction game.  Cards come in three types; Artists, Thinkers and Leaders, each with a picture and short biography of an appropriate historical character, and in two colors, red if born before 1700 and yellow if afterwards.   The Code Master chooses a pattern for cards to be laid down in incorporating color, type or both, either from the Code cards supplied or by inventing his own.  Players, including the Code Master, then take it in turns to play cards from their hands and are told whether the cards are correct or not.  If a player deduces the pattern before running out of cards he scores; otherwise the Code Master scores.&#10;&#10;Based, according to the rule leaflet, on a game by the same author called Eleusis published in 1963.&#10;&#10;"

Each piece on the real side of the board has a reflection on the virtual side, which acts in all ways as a real piece. The pieces come in three types; red with red reflection, yellow with yellow reflection, and red with a yellow reflection (and vice versa, of course).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player can introduce a piece to the edge of the board, slide a piece of his colour or a dual piece or turn a dual piece 180 degrees.   The aim of the game is to produce a line of 5  (but no more) pieces of his colour in any direction.&#10;&#10;"

Tiles are placed on the board as it is explored; initially each player is looking for the rooms containing their equipment (Key, allowing teleportation between various points, Weapon and Armour). On the way they encounter Monsters to defeat. Once they have found their equipment players make their way to the center of the board to challenge the Dragon; defeating him wins the game. Players can have combat with each other if they land on the same space and can barter items with each other.&#10;&#10;Success is dependent on your rooms turning up somewhere near you early on in the game. There is a limited amount of decision making re the routes and which is the best way to put tiles.&#10;&#10;The components are quite attractive and sturdy.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a Story Booklet and a leaflet explaining how the Invalay board system will be used in subsequent games; unfortunately this game, the company and the system all appear to have sunk without trace!&#10;&#10;"
