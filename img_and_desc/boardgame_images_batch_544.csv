Both sides have nascent pike-and-shot armies, the French still relying upon feudal knights, and the Spanish increasingly dependent on new individual firearms. Both sides also relied on mercenaries: Italian musketeers, Swiss pikemen, German Landsknechts. Tercios, too, are in their infancy; at Pavia, the battle is fought by smaller formations maneuvering in a broken, wooded area.&#10;&#10;Pavia uses the new Pike &amp; Shot game system to portray the battlefields of the early gunpowder period. Infantry is based on pike formations with varying numbers of attached musketeers. Other musketeers operate independently, useful for skirmishing but vulnerable to both infantry and cavalry. Shock power comes from heavy cavalry, armored horsemen armed with pistol and sword, but relying increasingly on firepower to wear down opponents. Light cavalry roam the battlefield, too weak to stand up to their heavy cousins, but ruthless during a pursuit. The newest form of horsemen are the dragoons, men trained to fight mounted and on foot, ideal for seizing key points in advance of the main body. Artillery is still in its infancy; the large, powerful guns are all-but-immobile. However, different armies at different times experiment with lighter, more mobile weapons.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map&#10;&bull;    100 die-cut counters&#10;&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series&#10;&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title&#10;&#10;"

As the Third Crusade drags on, the Crusaders can make no headway to reach the Levantine interior against Saladin&rsquo;s highly mobile Arab army; but Saladin cannot generate enough power to break the Crusaders and recapture coastal cities. In the summer of 1191, Richard the Lionheart leads a Crusader army south along the coast, intending  eventually to turn east toward Jerusalem. Saladin, hoping to catch the Crusaders strung out on the march &mdash; as he had done four years earlier at Hattin &mdash; prepares to launch a strike near the ruined city of Jaffa. But, Richard, anticipating the attack, musters his army in a tight formation but continues to march nonetheless. On the morning of 7 September, Saladin strikes.&#10;&#10;Arsuf is a contest of nimble Arab archers against stout Crusader men-at-arms, backed by the cream of European chivalry. Victory will go to the player who deploys to best utilize his strengths and take advantage of enemy weaknesses.&#10;&#10;Arsuf uses the new Battles of the Medieval World system, a variation on the venerable Battles of the Ancient World system. The battle is dominated by masses of heavy cavalry and disciplined lines of heavily-armed and armored men-at-arms. Swirling around these forces are masses of foot- and horse-archers, whose purpose is to disrupt the heavy formations to make them easy prey for their counterparts. Using the classic Combat Results Table, the fighting is close and bloody until the morale of one side weakens. Once a line breaks, the victor must pursue ruthlessly to prevent a rally. Leaders enhance combat power and restore broken formations.&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map&#10;&bull;    100 die-cut counters&#10;&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series&#10;&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title&#10;&#10;(source: Decision games website)&#10;&#10;"

Boldly cutting himself loose from his supply line&mdash;as Cortes had done three centuries earlier&mdash;Scott embarked upon a risky campaign: He had only slender political support; a single reverse&mdash;or an inordinately bloody victory&mdash;might have spelled the end of his campaign. Instead of an assault on Mexican fortifications east of the capital, Scott circled to the south where large lakes and a lava bed (the Pedregal) gave him numerous approach routes. The Mexicans quickly moved to block him, fortifying the most obvious routes, but they neglected to man the Pedregal itself, thinking it impassable to large units. The US forces, led by an excellent set of engineer officers, repeatedly found paths through the morass. But the US army was roughly half the size of the Mexican army and necessarily was divided. A resolute Mexican attack at the proper moment could have led to the destruction of Scott&rsquo;s army.&#10;&#10;Pedregal uses the Musket &amp; Saber system to accurately portray warfare during the Mexican War. All the primary facets of the muzzle-loading era are included. The combat system rewards intuitive play without the need for rifle-counting. There are substantial differences between infantry, artillery, and cavalry: Infantry, tough and resilient, bear the brunt of battle. Artillery can smash attacks or open holes in enemy lines, but is vulnerable and brittle. Cavalry is weak in stand-up combat, but crucial for pursuit and the occasional charge against a broken foe. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time, so players must maintain reserves. Leader provide an important supplement to unit capabilities, and armies must protect their headquarters and logistical tail or risk deterioration of their mobility and combat power.&#10;&#10;Winning a battle depends upon deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.&#10;&#10;"

Jacks in the Trump Suit (known as &quot;Right&quot; Jacks) are the highest value, Jacks in the same color but different suit as Trump (known as &quot;Left&quot; Jacks, or &quot;Bowers&quot;) are second highest value cards, and opposite colored Jacks (no special name) are valued as normal. In all other suits, the Ace is the highest value with 9 being the lowest.&#10;&#10;Each person bids only once, starting with the player to the left of the dealer, as an estimate of how many tricks they think they can take as a team (do not declare a suit, only a number). If the person bidding is the first person of the team, they may bid a &quot;signal bid&quot; to help their teammate bid higher (see below for signal bids). You may only bid if you bid higher than the person who bid before you. Otherwise you must say &quot;pass.&quot; After all 4 players have bid or passed, the highest bidder wins the power to pick the suit of trump (which affects the value of Jacks and of the trump suit). The bidder then starts by playing a card. If &quot;no trump&quot; is chosen, aces are the highest value of card, but the person to the right of the winning bidder starts. Unlike other games, such as Bridge, all suits are considered equal, except for that of trump, and the &quot;left&quot; Jacks.&#10;&#10;As the first card is played, each player must follow suit if able (note: &quot;Left&quot; Jacks become the suit of trump and no longer qualify as being of their original suit. These Jacks are called &quot;Bowers&quot;). After each player has played a card, the highest card in the suit wins the trick. If you are unable to follow suit, you may play trump, which automatically becomes the winning suit. A higher trump card can win, but all players must follow the suit that was lead.&#10;&#10;After the trick is taken, the player who took the trick may lead the next trick with the card of his/her choice. If you win the number of tricks you bid (or more), you team is awarded a point for each trick taken. The team that did not win the bid also receives a point for each trick taken. If the team that won the bid does not take enough tricks equal to or greater than the number bid, they are &quot;set.&quot; They receive a negative score equal to their bid. The other team is scored as normal.&#10;&#10;Signal Bids:&#10;1-4 (I have X number of aces in my hand. If you have more than 4 aces, you should either bid 4 to signal aces or bid 6+ to win the bid and possibly choose &quot;no trump&quot; as the suit of power.)&#10;5 (I have at least 1 black and at least 1 red jack in my hand. This shows trump power/support to your partner if they are to win the bid and choose the suit of trump.)&#10;6-12 (I can take X number of tricks, but can only do so in my suit of choice. This is a bid that attempts to win the bid rather than signal your teammate. However, a bid of 6 shows your partner that you may have some Jacks, but they are of one color and you don't have much supporting power)&#10;&#10;A winning bid is usually a 7 or 8 or an occasional 9 or 10 bid. 6 bids rarely win, and 11/12 bid hands are difficult to come by, though entirely possible.&#10;&#10;Historical note: I have never found the name or rules for this game to be published in any book or website, and I have only ever found players of this game in the state of Minnesota, usually by elderly people in rural areas. It may be of Scandinavian or German heritage.&#10;&#10;"

Mr. Card Game is a rule-breaking, cross-classing monster killer on a tabletop quest to free King Ralph XI from the Naughty Sorceress. As you and your fellow tabletop adventurers chart a course through the Kingdom of Loathing, whoever buys the right skills, acquires the best stats and can take down the Naughty Sorceress first wins the game and the right to lord it over his or her friends (friends not included with game).&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DescriptionMr. Card Game is the official tabletop game of the massive multiplayer online game Kingdom of Loathing. With a mixture of deck-building mechanics and tableau management, Mr. Card Game is a fantasy adventure themed character building card game for 2 to 5 players ages 13 and up which plays in less than an hour.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;SynopsisEach player begins with a deck of one point stats and a set of basic newbie gear. On your turn, you have the opportunity to select one of the monsters on top of the location draft piles to kill. By defeating a monster, you receive a new item (displayed on the reverse side of the monster card) to add to your tableau, a new stat card to add to your deck and meat tokens you can use on subsequent turns to draft skills. Once one or more of the players thinks they have accumulated enough power from killing monsters, upgrading stats and training skills to defeat the Naughty Sorceress, they may call a March of the Tower where all players have an opportunity to kill her together. They player with the highest power and enough to kill the Sorceress, wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;StrategyThe gameplay in Mr. Card Game is a hybrid of deck building and tableau management. Mr. Card Game is a game of drafting, not only drafting items and skills, but also the stat cards necessary to use those items and skills most effectively. You want to plot a course through the locations in the game which maximizes the synergy of the skill and item cards you draft into your tableau with the stat cards you draft into your deck. All the while managing your level of meat, the currency of the realm you acquire from killing monsters, which you need to purchase the skills which make you better. Tactically, the game relies upon your management of your tableau, when to use or sell items, and how effectively you craft the hand of cards necessary to defeat your target or perhaps even win the game.&#10;&#10;"

Before the next issue can be printed, six pieces of rashly commissioned copy need to be retrieved from a somewhat motley bunch of recalcitrant writers:&#10;&#10;Travel blogger and author of Leicester: City of Crisps Toby D&rsquo;Azure.&#10;Girl-about-town and sparkly-heeled chick-lit tyro Sophie Blush.&#10;Postmodern goremeister and connoisseur of noir Justin Slick.&#10;Aga-endorsing barbour-clad romantic novelist Lavinia Snowe.&#10;Former Para turned lad-mag agony uncle David &ldquo;Dave&rdquo; Green.&#10;Otherworldly and oddly androgynous sci-fi bod CT Vermillion.&#10;&#10;All are published authors but, on account of not being published as often as they feel they should be, will still take freelance work wherever they can get it, and aren&rsquo;t too fussed about style or topic: in fact, all insist that being able to turn in stuff &ldquo;outside their normal comfort zone&rdquo; stops them getting stuck in a generic rut and keeps them fresh and edgy; the alternative suggestion &ndash; that they have no shame and will do anything for a free lunch and a small sub to get them through till next Friday &ndash; is, they say, just insulting nonsense. On this, they are all agreed; on everything else, they are united only in their mutual contempt, jealousy, and suspicion. They are, in a word, writers.&#10;&#10;And, being writers, all six are currently holed up in six Soho pubs, cadging free drinks, chatting up people half their age (but with, oddly, twice their looks), and complaining vociferously about their agents, about dumbing down in the publishing industry, and about how they didn&rsquo;t want that Eastenders gig anyway as it would have compromised their artistic integrity and also possibly involved buying a TV licence.&#10;&#10;The noble editors&rsquo; thankless task is to contact all six writers and extricate their beer/sauvignon-stained prose from whichever unwholesome pocket or handbag it&rsquo;s been stuffed in.

Shuffle this deck, then deal each player twelve cards. Each round a new holiday card is up for grabs, with the cards ranked from 1 to 12 and being worth 1-12 points. In a round, a player:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Gifts a present to the player to his left,&#10;     Opens presents and tries to win the day with the best present, and&#10;     Buys a new gift to refill his hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;More specifically, all players simultaneously pass one face-down gift card to their left-hand neighbor. Then everyone chooses one gift card in hand and reveals them simultaneously. Whoever plays the lowest gift card wins that round's holiday card; in the event of a tie for lowest, with the Clauses counting as zero, then the next lowest card wins. Each player then draws one card to bring their hand back to twelve cards.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, players score points for each holiday card they've collected. In addition, whoever holds the most gift cards for each rank scores as many points as that rank, with all tied players scoring in the event of a tie. Whoever has the most points wins. Happy holidays!&#10;&#10;"

You need to &#239;&#172;&#129;nd the tastiest food, but watch out for dangerous predators that hope to eat you! Play your cards carefully, escape from the tigers, and keep an eye on the sky in case a vulture is watching you &ndash; after all, little animals make a great dessert!&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical deck of 22 animal cards; at the start of the game, players shuffle their decks, then draw six cards as a starting hand. Someone shuffles the plant deck, then lays out plants until at least one (regular or famine) card is available for each type of plant and at least 3-7 plant cards are available (with the number depending on the number of players).&#10;&#10;Each turn the starting player lays down two cards &ndash; one face-up and the other face-down &ndash; then each other player does the same. Players then reveal all their cards and work their way down the food chain: Bats attack herbivores, weakening them and making them eat more slowly; snakes scare away the strongest animal; elephants, tigers, buffaloes and monkeys then eat (one card) in order of their strength, from high to low; elephants eat nuts, or bananas if no nuts remain; tigers eat the highest-valued buffalo or monkey; buffaloes eat herbs, then bananas; monkeys eat anything but prefer bananas; warthogs eat last but consume two items; the animal young copy the animal they're played with and eat at the same time; vultures feed on buffaloes and monkeys that are forced to eat famine cards &ndash; or any such animal that fed. (They're not that choosey, really.) Animals can also be played in matching pairs, which prevents them from being eaten but restricts them to only one food card.&#10;&#10;After the round ends, each player draws two more animal cards from his deck, the plant selection is replenished, then a new round begins, with the player who ate first in the previous round playing first now. As soon as players have only four cards in hand or the plant selection can't be refilled, the game ends, and the player with the most food points wins!&#10;&#10;"

In Batman: Gotham City Strategy Game, you'll play as one of Gotham City's greatest villains &ndash; The Joker, The Penguin, Killer Croc, or Two-Face &mdash; and lead your gang of henchmen to try to become the King of Crime in Gotham City! But beware, as your hold on the city increases, so does the chance of your plans being foiled by Gotham's protector &ndash; Batman!&#10;&#10;During the game, players collect resources of information, money and threat; threat is used to exert your rule over blocks in Gotham City, and control of blocks allows you to collect income on these blocks of either information or money. Money is used for leveling and to hire henchmen who will help you rule city blocks and fight better against other villains and Batman. Information is used for leveling and moving your villain and henchmen through the city blocks. Leveling works as follows: Each villain has a combat dial with ten levels. Each click of the dial shows a requirement that you will need to advance to the next level: information, money, henchmen, or blocks controlled. The first player to reach level 10 with his villain wins. On every even number level, players will acquire special abilities unique to their villain.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player will play a Criminal Plot card which will either produce an income for the ruler of a certain block or trigger the Bat Signal, which calls in Batman! When Batman moves into a block with a Villain, a fight occurs using the two custom Batman dice included with the game. If Batman wins, the villain and his henchmen must flee to their hideout and Batman restores order in that block of Gotham City; if the villain wins, they have defeated Batman (for the time being) and Batman returns to the Batcave, increasing his combat effectiveness as he plans for the next encounter.&#10;&#10;"

furthermore, the idea of invading Greece through the Balkans, was not as easy as it looked.&#10;&#10;It was only thanks to a major German commitment in the Mediterranean that operations swung in favor of the Axis and the name of Rommel became a legend. &#10;&#10;It was also said that, by having to provide aid to the Italians in the Balkans, Germany diverted manpower that was needed in Russia and hence sowed the seeds of the Axis defeat in the East.&#10;&#10;However, as soon as America was thrown into the war by the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the fate of the Axis was written in stone and defeat was only a matter of time.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN AFRIKA recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the African Theater Front from the Italian drive to Marsa Matruh in Summer 1940, until the collapse of the Italian Regime in Semptember 1943.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN AFRIKA is a game for two players, one controls the Western Allies and the other one controls the Axis Powers.&#10;Although based on history, players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War 2 in the Mediterranean Theater.&#10;&#10;RULES INTRODUCTION&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time.&#10;The first section is the BASIC GAME RULES which introduces the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;Then the ADVANCED GAME RULES provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.&#10;Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, OPTIONAL RULES can be added as desired.&#10;The Optional Rules include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, Parachute Assaults&hellip;&#10;&#10;SCALE&#10;A hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 Km) across.&#10;A turn is 1 month long.&#10;A full strength counter represents 300 planes, 300 Tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the type unit, equipment and nationality.&#10;&#10;FOG OF WAR&#10;The game must be played with the Fog of War on (wooden blocks are placed on the map in such a way the opponent player can not see them).&#10;&#10;Language: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian&#10;Genre: Operational, Strategic&#10;Turns: Turn-Based&#10;Complexity: Basic to Advanced, depending on which rules are used and on Scenario Lenght&#10;Period: World War II&#10;&#10;SCENARIOS&#10;With over 240 units counters and 200 different resource points of various color, players can enjoy hours of fun by playing one of the ten BIA scenarios, one of the four 7-turn BIE scenarios (in cobination with BITE and BITW) or the gargantuan 1939 CAMPAIGN.&#10;&#10;1940 Operation Compass, November 1940 - March 1941&#10;1941 Operation Exporter, June - July 1941&#10;1941 Middle- East Uprising, May - September 1941&#10;1941 Operation Marita-Merkur, April - June 1941&#10;1941 The Desert Fox, March - July 1941&#10;1942 Tobruk, June - October 1942&#10;1942  El Alamein, October 1942 - February 1943&#10;&#10;NAVAL BATTLES &#10;
