It's also not to be confused with the same author's Beowulf: The Legend. It's an abstract strategy clothed in a theme based on the movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. The players' goal is to score the most victory points by clever tile and figurine placement on the board, composed of squares arranged in a grid. Its layout is changed, as the game is divided into three chapters that feature slightly different sets of tiles that can be drawn. Clever hand management (of tiles and figurines) is also important in the game, as some of them can be used only once throughout the entire game. Gameplay is as follows:&#10;&#10;1. On his or her turn, a player may either place a tile (which can be a negative or a positive number, feature a special power or not) or a figurine on the board. If the player wishes to place a tile, he/she can add one to his/her hand of two and place one of the three tiles. Special powers of these tiles may be: displace a figurine, swap a tile from the board from the one from a player's hand, block other tiles, increase the power of figurines in the same row/column, cancel positive numbers on tiles, swap two tiles on the board.&#10;&#10;2. By placing tiles and figurines, players will form rows and columns. After the board is full, the value of each figurine is calculated. Each figurine has a value of 1-4. This value is multiplied by the sum of values of all tiles from tiles that are in its row and column. Special powers of tiles may apply here (like the increasing of figurines' power or blocking). Players evaluate all their figurines on the board and gain points equal to their value.&#10;&#10;This game differs considerably from its predecessor (not all of these may apply to the third English edition by Fantasy Flight Games released in 2012):&#10;&#10;1. In Kingdoms, all three acts took place on the same board. Here, the board is two-sided, with three varying grids.&#10;2. There are more positive tiles than negative ones in this game, therefore situations when players lose points for their figurines are much less frequent.&#10;3. Here, a player manages a hand of three tiles. In Kingdoms, the players had no hand. Instead, he/she drew a single tile which had to be placed on the board.&#10;4. There are more tiles with special powers. More tiles can be swapped, even figurines can change their position, which didn't happen in Kingdoms.&#10;&#10;"

It started before the birth of Christ (B.C.) and lasted, in the East, until year 476 A.D. (anno domini) and, in the West, until 1453 A.D. Let us go back to year 140 D.C., when this Empire reached its greatest extension and dominated practically all Europe, part of Asia and northern Africa. Times that were not completely peaceful, for enemies threatened the borders of the empire and the conquered people insurrected against domination, seeking freedom. Go back in time with War: Roman Empire and feel the thrill of defending your borders and advancing your legions, conquering provinces of the roman world in 140 A.D.! Observe, though, that the political division of the provinces adopted in the board objectives to ease the game mechanics, and not portrait the reality of that age. All province and sea names are written in latin. Only the region names are in portuguese. Each players is dealt an objective, that will only be known by himself. The knowledge of this objective by other players will make your conquest harder. It is important for the player to, when reading the rules, try some practical plays, simulating, inclusively, the mentioned examples. This way it will be much easier to understand the mechanisms of WAR.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    War&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The board is further divided into three parts by two other &quot;one-way&quot; arrows and while movement can normally be back and forth, once passing these arrows they may not be passed in the wrong direction again. The board is not a single track either; there are branches that may be explored in search of opportunities. Bus stops allow the players to cover distance quickly (which of course costs money, though) and there are two kiosks where they can buy newspapers with job ads, or raffle tickets in the hope of some quick cash winnings. And then the most important places; the jobs. If a player holds a paper with the correct job ad they're hired automatically, if not they can try to roll for a 5 or 6. Whether or not the player is hired they can only apply for the same job once per board round, and can only work a total of 2 different jobs before passing &quot;Go&quot; again. (Interestingly, while an out-of-cash tourist in a strange town - possibly in a foreign country - the player can still work pretty demanding jobs such as policeman, fireman etc.) And of course, there is the occasional event space to brighten or darken the players' day with some funny escapades or swings of luck.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect 3000 money (currency not specified in the game) and then get to the airport - on an exact roll, mind you - wins.&#10;&#10;"

Lee's first invasion of the North, Lee learned of a threatening Federal advance East of Hagerstown, Maryland. Because Stonewall Jackson was besieging Harper' Ferry, he instructed Daniel Harvey Hill to hold the South Mountain passes in the rugged Blue Ridge, just East of Boonsboro. It was essential to delay McClellan&rsquo;s progress so Jackson would have time to take Harper's Ferry and reunite his scattered divisions before the Army of the Potomac caught him unprepared.&#10;&#10;Despite strong defensive features the numerically superior Federal forces should have overwhelmed the rebels but the inaction of Pleasonton and Burnside squandered their advantage. In the end Lee's defense of the South Mountain passes cost him 2800 casualties as opposed to the Federal losses of 2300 and led directly to the fearful slaughter at Antietam.&#10;&#10;Fire on the Mountain concentrates on the action around Turner's Gap and Fox Gap, emphasizing the difficulty of mountainous terrain and the seesaw nature of the battle into which reinforcements continue to trickle and the effects of officer casualties. The game uses simple mechanics to simulate movement, artillery, cavalry, leaders, and difficult terrain, with a unique combat system that allows the game to move quickly while still simulating the tense nature of the battle.&#10;&#10;Game scale&#10;Unit size: Brigades&#10;Game Turn: represents 1 hour&#10;Hex Scale: 300 yds per hex&#10;Playtime: 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours&#10;Complexity: Low to Moderate&#10;&#10;"

I never saw you retreat before. Form! Form! It&rsquo;s only a scouting probe!&rdquo; &#10;--General Howe, a little before 7:00 AM upon seeing, out of the fog, the headlong retreat of the 2nd Light Infantry pickets. Moments later he and his staff came under sustained American artillery fire.&#10; A Barbarous Ground is a simulation of the battle fought on October 4th, 1777, at the crossroads village of Germantown between the Continental Army under General George Washington and the British Army under Lord Cornwallis.  The British had split their Army after occupying Philadelphia, and Washington believed he was presented with an excellent opportunity with defeating the invaders in detail. While the initial American attack succeeded splendidly, the morning fog, smoke, a determined stand by the British 40th Regiment at Chew House, and greater British experience in battle allowed the defending forces time to regroup and counter-attack; snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Can you do better?&#10; A Barbarous Ground uses an interactive sequence of play that activates formations, and their subordinate units, by the types of orders (Attack, Advance, Stand, Reserve) they have been issued. Combat is of two types, fire and melee, and both individual unit and larger formation morale figure prominently in the game&rsquo;s outcome. Rules include ones for leaders and variable reinforcements. Scenarios cover the morning&rsquo;s &ldquo;opening round&rdquo; in which both sides were surprised to discover a fight would occur here, the afternoon&rsquo;s bloody, climatic slugfest in which the American offensive was spent, and the British managed to snatch a degree of victory from the jaws of defeat.&#10; Terrain scale is about 200 yards per hex&#10;Infantry units and cavalry units are mostly regiments, artillery units are battalions. Each strength point represents 250 men.&#10;Each turn is about 30 minutes. &#10; Playing time is about 2.5 to 3 hours for the AM and PM scenarios, about 6+ hours for the day-long battle scenario.

Kit Carson was given command of the US forces, and his mission was to find the Comanche and Kiowa winter camps and eliminate this threat to the settlers that were moving into and through this area of the Texas panhandle.&#10;&#10;Adobe Walls shares many similarities with Little Bighorn.  The battle features a famous US leader in Kit Carson, attacking a large Indian camp along a river with a much smaller US force. He is also temporarily separated from the pack train, and the size of the Indian force was greatly underestimated.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Battle of Adobe Walls&quot; adds a new weapon to the series, the Mountain Howitzer.

The first battles began with the bombing of the island in ealry 1942 and ended in May of that year with it's surrender.&#10; After General Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines, Corregidor once again became a target of invasion, both to avenge the loss three years before and to clear the mouth of Manila Bay to Allied shipping.&#10; Corregidor: Fall of a Fortress 1942/1945, includes two games. The first game recreates the Japanese bombardment and invasion in 1942 and the second simulates the American airborne invasion and reconquest in 1945.&#10;&#10;&#10;EXTENDED GAME DESCRIPTION:&#10;&#10;CORREGIDOR is played in successive game turns composed of alternate player turns during which the phasing player maneuvers his units and resolves combat in sequence. Turns consist of the Administrative Phases (reinforcement arrival, disruption removal, Fired marker removal), the Air Attack Phase (which includes airborne assault), first Player Turn (AA fire, bombardment, invasion, ground movement, and combat), and then the second Player Turn.&#10;&#10;Some detail features of the game are tracking Japanese landing craft losses, American communications disruption, U.S. air and naval support points, unit disruption levels, and which artillery units have fired.&#10;&#10;The six hexes adjacent to an undisrupted land unit constitute that unit&rsquo;s Zone of Control. Disrupted land units DO NOT have ZOCs, and therefore judicious use of support to disrupt enemy units allows the attacker to infiltrate through weak positions and to launch flanking attacks against defending units. This is critical because defending units are doubled and sometimes tripled by the rugged and the unique features on the maps, such as rough terrain, cliffs, elevation changes, tunnels, towns, and coast defense artillery emplacements.&#10;&#10;In the 1942 scenarios, there is a cat-and-mouse game which develops between the Japanese artillery and air units versus the American artillery and anti-aircraft defenses. Aircraft need to designate the altitude at which they conduct bombing &ndash; the lower the attack level the more accurate the bombing, but also the more accurate the AA fire. Similarly, artillery which fires is more vulnerable to counter-battery fire and so making a bombardment attack must be weighed against the possibility of return fire.&#10;&#10;In 1945, in addition to banzai options, the Japanese have the option to make suicide demolitions, which destroy the attacking unit but also damage adjacent units. There is a mechanism to occasionally compel such attacks, which not only forces some historicity but it also models the uncoordinated local Japanese command structure in 1945.&#10;&#10;Some optional rules included:&#10;&#10;Spike Rule - U.S. Batteries must be spiked when Japanese units come within two hexes to prevent them from being captured in usable condition. They may not be voluntarily destroyed until after a Japanese unit has landed on their island. Flip the battery over after the following U.S. Bombardment Phase. The unit may then move and fight normally.&#10;&#10;Restored Batteries - Roll one die on the turn of the American invasion in 1945 for the surviving former U.S. batteries:&#10; 1 &ndash; Battery may fire normally.&#10; 2 &ndash; Battery sabotaged by POWs, gun crew fights as infantry.&#10;3-6 &ndash; Battery was never manned; remove from map.&#10;&#10;Additional U.S. Batteries - Three 240mm howitzer batteries which were to be installed in 1922 actually arrive. One battery is deployed anywhere on Fort Frank, one on Fort Hughes, and one on Fort Mills (Corregidor).&#10;&#10;Philippine Division Transferred - The 31st, 45th, and 57th Regiments are transferred to Corregidor prior to the fall of Bataan. Add them to the available U.S. forces in Scenario 11.1. Due to the effects of fighting on Bataan, plus short rations and disease, these units are deployed at reduced strength. As an additional option, they may be deployed at full strength to simulate these units being in better condition historically.&#10;&#10;Itagaki Rule - Japanese defense commander Capt. Itagaki did not believe an airborne assault could be made on Corregidor. He was killed on Topside during the initial paradrop, while waiting to observe the amphibious assault for which he had prepared. Additionally, his central communications station was overrun very quickly by the paratroops. In this rule, he is killed and no Japanese unit may move until the first night turn.&#10;&#10;U.S. Roving Batteries - During the campaign for Bataan and Corregidor, the U.S. created a number of &ldquo;roving batteries&rdquo; of 155mm guns by removing them from their emplacements and mounting them such that they could be moved about Corregidor.&#10;&#10;U.S. Searchlights - The U.S. had several searchlight batteries on the Fortified Islands. This option forces the Japanese to actually expend the effort to destroy them and if they are not, they provide some advantage to the U.S. Player.&#10;&#10;If a Japanese invasion or evacuation is occurring in a night turn and there is an active U.S. searchlight unit on the map, the U.S. Player receives a +2 die modifier (cumulative with any other DRMs) when firing on Japanese units in water hexes.&#10;&#10;If a Japanese air bombardment is conducted at night, U.S. Anti-aircraft fire receives an additional +1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply; Japanese Bombardment rolls receive an additional -1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply.&#10;&#10;Battery Way - Battery Way did not have a crew and was not operational until April 28. The U.S. might have activated this battery sooner. Roll at the beginning of the 0300 daily turn. The battery is active at full strength on a roll of 2 or 12. The battery becomes active automatically on Turn 65 if not activated sooner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game scale&#10;Unit size: Generally artillery batteries and infantry platoons, with some company- and section-size units. Some individual naval units are depicted; air units are generally three aircraft per step.&#10;&#10;Game turn: Movement and combat on the Fortified Islands maps is in three-hour turns in 1942, and two-hour daylight turns in 1945, with night turns representing five hours each. There are also daily turns to keep track of reinforcements as well as to frame the complete campaigns. By mutual agreement, players may skip any daily or hourly turn in which neither player plans to execute any movement, combat, or bombardment.&#10;&#10;Hex scale: The scale of the Fortified Islands map is roughly 250 yards per hex; the scale of the Bataan map is roughly 1.25 miles per hex.&#10;&#10;"

Part of Admiral Nimitz's Operation Granite II, the seizure of the Marianas was divided into two parts, the Northern Troops Landing Force (NTLF) and the Southern Troops Landing Force (STLF). Saipan and Tinian were the objectives for the NTLF, with Saipan being the immediate objective and Tinian the second. The STLF objective was Guam. Before the Capture of Saipan both the US Navy and the Japanese Navy had powerful carrier based air forces, and with the exception of China based aircraft, no US land based aircraft could reach homeland Japan. After the capture of Saipan only the US Navy had a powerful carrier based air arm, and powerful land based bombers could now bomb Japan relentlessly.&#10;&#10;Tinian is a simulation of the American invasion and capture of Tinian in the summer of 1944. Tinian was the first US Marine Corps sized shore-to-shore operation and it was the first time napalm was used against enemy troops. After its seizure Tinian was developed into the greatest B-29 base in the war. B-29s from Tinian flew 29,000 missions and dropped over 157,000 tons of bombs on Japan by the end of the war, including the two atomic bomb missions flown by the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bocks Car&quot; against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&#10;&#10;Saipan Game Components:&#10;17&quot; x 22&quot; map&#10;270 Double-sided game counters&#10;&#10;Tinian Game Components:&#10;11&quot; x 17&quot; map&#10;180 Double-sided counters&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion&#10;Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile&#10;Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours&#10;&#10;The Island War Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II. Each game in the system represents a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese forces on one of the many Pacific Islands.&#10;The series begins with Vol. I - Saipan/Tinian and will also include Guam - Vol. II , and Attu &amp; Kiska - Vol. III.&#10;&#10;Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Pacific Island Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of the battles covered in the series, all naval and air forces are abstract. This means the main focus of each game is ground combat. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. For example, one player can play the US Marines, one can play the US Army, and the third plays the Japanese.&#10;&#10;This series of games is loosely based on or inspired by several different game systems, including SPI's Island War series and GRD/GDW's Europa series, but many concepts are quite original. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &quot;against the odds&quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the  defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart. This also puts a lot of pressure on the attacker because he cannot afford to make many mistakes.&#10;&#10;Game features include:&#10;1. Limited intelligence&#10;2. Amphibious Landings&#10;3.

For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment. Because of the presence of the GD, the Soviets were unable to force a breakthrough and decided to commit the 3rd Mech Corps into the meat grinder to force the issue...&#10;&#10;Designer Wig Graves conducted extensive research, combing both German and Soviet sources to create the order of battle. The Soviets begin with seemingly overwhelming force, while the Germans trade space for time and attempt to rush reinforcements to the front to plug inevitable gaps.

There is now a new type of card: Ungoal cards (conditions in which everybody loses!)&#10;&#10;Fluxx is a card game where the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. By playing cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to win.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game. There are many editions, themed siblings, and promo cards available.&#10;&#10;Part of the Fluxx series.&#10;&#10;"

There are 5 suits of 12 cards, numbered from 1-12 and showing an additional geometrical sign (triangle, square, diamond, circle).&#10;&#10;Object of the game is to get rid of his cards first. You can play a card on the discard pile, if either the suit, the number or the geometrical sign is equal to the top card on the pile.&#10;&#10;If you can't play a card, you must take a card from the stock, but the number of cards in the hand is limited to 3 or 4 depending if you play a 2- or 3-player game.&#10;&#10;"

The beer bottles are empty and you walk through the village to exchange them against full ones in the taverns or directly at the brewery.&#10;&#10;If you meet one of your opponents, you have a drink, so both players lose one of their full bottles.&#10;&#10;There are also two neutral &quot;Nassauer&quot;, (German expression for a &quot;scrounger&quot;), and if a player meets one of him, he has to have a drink with that, too.&#10;&#10;Aim is, to get as many full bottles at home as possible, which is easier late in the game, when you can just slip through empty taverns (=no full bottles anymore) and shorten your ways.&#10;&#10;The board representing &quot;Buddlbrunn&quot; has some similarities to the &quot;Petri-Netz&quot;, as do the other games of Helmut Dressler, &quot;Play Net&quot; and &quot;Glebdo&quot;.&#10;&#10;Some people shall have played this with real bottles and real drinking ...&#10;&#10;Although it&acute;s quite an old game and very rare, it`s still available directly from the designer (April 2007)&#10;&#10;"

Two or three players control the opposing armies in any of four scenarios. The game shows central and eastern Ukraine at 32 kilometers/20 miles per hex and 7-8 days per turn, and the armies involved at about 2,000 combat troops per unit, with additional logistical bases, armored trains, river gunboats, and arms stockpiles.&#10;&#10;The design has been trimmed to focus on two key campaigns. *Fall of the Directory* shows the three-sided conflict at the end of 1918 and the first few months of 1919, where the Bolsheviks overthrew the Directory. *Revolt Against the Volunteer Army* shows the decisive campaigns in the last few months of 1919 and the beginning of 1920. *The Road to Freedom?* and *The Bolshevik Advance* present shorter parts of *Revolt.* *The Road to Freedom?* shows the Makhnovist campaign toward their home ground and into the Volunteer Army's rear areas, and the renewed uprising. *The Bolshevik Advance* shows the Volunteer Army retreating onto the map, and the Red Army chasing after them, with all sides scrambling to control key areas.&#10;&#10;These scenarios represent campaigns which could have changed the course of the Ukrainian Civil War. In *Fall of the Directory,* the Directory could have defeated the Bolsheviks and quite possibly have retained independence. In *Revolt Against the Volunteer Army,* the Makhnovists could have won a stronger position and quite possibly have gained autonomy.&#10;&#10;Note: The early drafts used larger hexes, larger units, and a smaller map than the current design. The design notes sometimes refer to &quot;Revolt Against the Volunteer Army&quot; as &quot;Makhno's Return.&quot;&#10;&#10;"
