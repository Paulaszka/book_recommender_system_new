Expand your city, recruit characters, rise in economic power and complete quests to gain prestige and increase your influence. In the end only the first to finish a wonder through prestige alone is the winner.

Through all of these you will first have to raise your influence to the highest level, 7, and finally transform your influence into coat-of-arms tokens to build a wonder and win.&#10;&#10;Imnia is at it's core a race to the finish embedded within a thematic economical strategy game.

Even despite all the warnings, we were still clogging our sky with smoke and dust driven by short sighted greed.

The plan is to transform what we&rsquo;ve already created, into something that would heal our poisoned world and ensure our survival. It&rsquo;s in your hands to design the most efficiently working city, that will take us closer to salvation.&#10;The game&rsquo;s theme is strictly linked with the idea of solarpunk. The core concept is set around the state of the environment we live in. Increasing pollution might air and water to become luxury goods. The solution? Conscious urban planning to use city buildings to produce clean energy, oxygen, and water.&#10;&#10;Various buildings are already being used in the real world in such manner and we can find examples like Bosco Verticale in Milan or Pasona Urban Farm in Tokyo.&#10;&#10;Solar City is a game where players design the future city. In each turn players choose one of the 3 actions:&#10;&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Build a Skyscraper that will bring you profits in the moment of activation&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Build a Public Buildings, that will improve the city structures&rsquo; performance.&#10;&#226;&#151;&#143; Activate the Vertical Farm &ndash; cover the Skyscrapers in green, activate the wind turbines, release the water flow, install photovoltaic panels, transforming it into a real factory of bioenergy and oxygen.&#10;&#10;Each action will activate a part of the city. The player who did that will get the profits from the buildings placed there and, more importantly, will block the possibility of activating this part of the city for the other players. This mechanic force players to adapt their strategy to new situations with each passing minute.&#10;&#10;The game contains over a dozen different building types. In every game only six of the will be used. Additionally, the game contains random set of Public Buildings. Thanks to that, every Solar City game will be an unique experience.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over the set number of rounds (depending on the player count) or up until the moment when one player fills their entire board. The winner is the one who contributed more to the positive change in worlds environment (gathered the most Oxygen Points).&#10;&#10;"

Each player will command up to a reinforced combined arms company, confronting the same challenges and fortunes of war as real tank commanders and infantry squad leaders in combat with the enemy.&#10;&#10;They will advance to contact, identify and react to threats, engage targets, and then adapt their own battle plans as necessary.

Treadheads centers around the concept of &ldquo;Time in Action&rdquo; as a way to simulate the interactive and simultaneous actions of units in a historical 1:1 engagement.

Popular with grognards and logistics nerds alike, it secured a nomination for the 2017 Golden Geek Award for Best Wargame. This hotly anticipated standalone sequel covers the second half of the American War of Independence, and shifts the scene to the Southern colonies of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas.&#10;&#10;It's more than just a change in locale, however; this game has a very different feel and emphasis than its predecessor. Both sides have much smaller armies with far fewer resources. The South, after all, is really a very minor theater: the British are chiefly concerned with holding onto their Caribbean possessions, particularly with the French, Dutch, and Spanish circling around those profitable islands, while George Washington is obsessed with taking back New York. Unsupported, Cornwallis must attempt to pacify the southern colonies one at a time while coming to grips with the slippery colonials, while avoiding being trapped himself. Maneuver is central this time around, thanks to new and utterly unforgiving siege rules.&#10;&#10;And while this operational cat-and-mouse chase dances across the colonies, partisan warfare rages as both sides seek to win hearts and minds. Crown Loyalists can greatly extend Cornwallis's supply lines, while daring Patriot Militia can harass the redcoats with Raids.&#10;&#10;To win this game and the war itself, you'll need to master irregular warfare, operational maneuver, siegecraft, naval affairs, and, of course, and perhaps above all, logistics.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Hand-management and timing is the key!&#10;&#10;Four Tribes is a game of strategy and tactics that is balanced with a bit of luck. Each player draws from their own deck of cards, but each player has the same deck, so while you may draw on the weak-side early on, you will know that powerful cards are coming up that you can capitalize on.&#10;&#10;Four Tribes can be setup, played, and put away in about 30 minutes, making it a great lunchtime or filler game.

Now the second motorcycle will point towards a number, and so a third motorcycle is moved forward (pointing to a number). And so it goes on.&#10;&#10;Eventually one of the already moved motorcycles will be moved a track piece ahead and point to another number on that track piece.

Packed with rabid and bloodthirsty fans, these barges feature an array of deadly hazards that are designed to indiscriminately kill or injure both combatants. These hazards range from floor saws that tear across the arena floors to pits that are home to monstrosities just looking for something to eat. Full of beautifully illustrated and amusingly inappropriate cards and lore, each match leaves you with a story to tell and laughs to be had by all.&#10;&#10;NEXUS puts classic tabletop gaming tools like dice, pen, and paper to good use; to pit genetically engineered champions against one another in visceral combat. Players will experience a rush as their dice rolls determine the fate of their hapless champions.&#10;&#10;The skirmish mode, while easily picked up by even the most novice of players, has just the right amount of depth, complexity, and self-generating narrative to make each match exhilarating. Dive even deeper with RPG legacy features and build your wealth and influence allowing for countless upgrades and bribes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
