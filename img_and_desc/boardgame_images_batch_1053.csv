What neither of them know: They contracted the new NOSO virus (STILL SO a virus) while on vacation! Only after three days of incubation do they feel sick and stay at home. But how many residents have the two infected meanwhile unnoticed?&#10;Can a major virus outbreak still be prevented?&#10;&#10;Virusalarm in Bleibhausen is a free game for children and adolescents from the age of 12 that was developed with scientists from IST Austria and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. By reenacting the spread of a fictional virus in a city, players will explore and understand what countermeasures can take to contain viruses. In the Home Edition for the home, the players slip into the role of scientists ( game variants &ldquo;simulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccination &rdquo;), or into the role of politicians who have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of restrictions on public life ( game variant &ldquo;Challenge &rdquo; ).&#10;&#10;Chips symbolize people, yellow ones are sick, white ones are still healthy. They are distributed in different buildings on a game board that depicts the fictional city of Bleibhausen. If there are white chips with yellow ones in a building, e.g. the restaurant, they become infected and turn yellow.&#10;&#10;Players try to minimise the spread and earn points depending on how well they control the disease.  The player/team with the most points, wins.&#10;&#10;Es ist ein sch&ouml;ner Fr&uuml;hlingstag, als im 100-Einwohner St&auml;dtchen Bleibhausen zwei Leute vom Skiurlaub zur&uuml;ckkommen.

This was one of the largest and most difficult urban operations of the post-WWII era, and marked a major defeat for Daesh and its so-called &ldquo;Islamic State.&rdquo; The game is thus able to combine low complexity (and hence be accessible to even neophyte wargamers) with a rich and detailed treatment of this important battle.&#10;&#10;Unlike most wargames where there is a single measure for victory or loss, We Are Coming, Nineveh assesses three key aspects of the campaign: the speed at which the operation is completed, the casualties suffered by Iraqi government forces, and the collateral damage done to Mosul. One might outperform the historical case, capturing the Old City faster&mdash;but at a terrible civilian cost.&#10;&#10;Winner of the Charles S.

This cannot be any higher than 10 or any lower than 2. The closer to 10, the less chance of the odds being chosen.

Everyone counts 3,2,1....then at the same time Person A &amp; Person B say the number they were thinking between those odds given.&#10;&#10;If they say the same number, then Person B must do the task for the points or risk loosing points.

Harvest, hire, build, and plan your way into the history books!&#10;&#10;At its heart, Ancient Realm is a civilization-building-themed puzzle game in which you try to maximize your points by deciding which blocks to keep and which to build over, while carefully managing your resources. Balance endgame scoring goal needs with immediate tactical needs to create a mighty civilization replete with wonders of the world.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you have four available cards to place. Some of them will be districts, the basic building blocks of civilization, while others will be wonders, powerful but costly constructions. Wonder cards feature one block and a wonder; wonders are worth a large number of points and offer potent effects, but require significant resources to construct and cannot be covered by further cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you pick one of these cards and place it in your realm. Cards can be placed next to, overlapping, or entirely covering one or more cards in your realm. When a block (or multiple blocks) is covered by a new card, those blocks can be activated to gain their effect. Mines fill your coffers with valuable gold; with gold, you can activate production sites and citizens. Citizens come in two types and might affect other cards, such as the value of certain wonders.&#10;&#10;On the back of each district card is an event that impacts the growth of your civilization, and the event on the top of the district deck is active for the round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, score your wonders and mines as well as any remaining gold and resources to determine how your civilization stacks up.&#10;&#10;"

The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.&#10;&#10;Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of Moving Pictures: Dinosaur Outbreak! is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don&rsquo;t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.&#10;&#10;COMBINING GAMES&#10;Dinosaur Outbreak! can be  combined with another Moving Pictures game.

You play a classic noir character who is trying to set up the perfect scene for their agenda. You have to play smart though, as it is easy for someone else to change the scene for their benefit also. Full of role playing opportunities, The Big Shuffle pairs well with a cigar, whiskey, and smooth jazz.&#10;&#10;In essence it is a game where everyone gets a different set of win conditions and you are trying to stop the others from hitting theirs with the scene cards in the middle. You not only have to plan your turn to try and change it to your win condition, but also use your reaction cards to try and stop others from winning on their turn keeping gameplay interactive and interesting even when someone else is trying to swing things in their favor.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.&#10;&#10;In more detail, just like in The Incredibles, Syndrome will face off against Frozone and the Parr family, using his minions and advanced technology to come out ahead. To win as Syndrome, players need to upgrade the Omnidroid, then defeat it and all heroes in his realm. Lotso seeks to control Sunnyside Daycare by reducing four heroes' strength (utilizing a game mechanism new to Disney Villainous) and moving those heroes to the toddlers' Caterpillar Room. Finally, those playing as Madam Mim will need to win a wizard's duel against Merlin, using Mim's Transformations to defeat Merlin's.&#10;&#10;Villainous: Bigger and Badder is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the other Disney Villainous games.&#10;&#10;"

If an opponent gets in the way and you end up in a square with an opponent - you have to start over! The goal is to end up in a square where the treasure marks are, collect the treasure and put the mark in the bag. The game is over when the last treasure mark is put in the bag.
