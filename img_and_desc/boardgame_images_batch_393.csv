One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).&#10;&#10;The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).&#10;&#10;The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.&#10;&#10;"

A player rolls the dice and then may move pawns that correspond to the total of the dice, e.g. rolling a 5 allows a player to move the 5 pawn, or the 2 and the 3. The pawns are always moved to the next free space that is available on the board.&#10;&#10;If the player succeeds in making a chain of 3 or more pawns, he or she may roll the dice again.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last three, specially-marked squares are occupied. Each player receives the number of points achieved by multiplying the number of the square by the number of the occupying pawn.&#10;&#10;Rules Summary:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Roll d6; may move your matching-numbered token (* is wild but moves only one token)&#10;    Move it to the next free space on the track&#10;    After any player's token has crossed a line (varies with number of players playing), rolls of 3 4 or 5 may be split between 2 of your tokens (3-&gt;1-2, 4-&gt;1-3, 5-&gt;1-4 or 2-3), but only if you can move both the other tokens&#10;    If, with your move, you create 3 adjacent tokens of your color, go again (may do it repeatedly)&#10;    The game ends when last 3 spaces of the track are occupied&#10;    Final scores (for each token):&#10;        (token number) x (number on that token's space)&#10;        the multiplier for tokens never played to the board is -5&#10;        highest sum wins&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The original version of the game provided players with six tokens and had different rules for gaining points from the board spaces.&#10;&#10;"

There are adapters you can attach to a line to make it act in unique and more devastating ways. But you will need to take care, as any actions you take may affect your own tokens.&#10;&#10;In addition to eliminating your opponent, you will need to earn enough points to solidify your victory. Earning points is as easy as placing your tokens in risky locations. Can you manage to outmaneuver and outscore your opponent? Will you pull off a victory even after all of your tokens are removed? Are you worthy of the title Grid Lion?&#10;&#10;"

So you have five dice for each of the speeds and two of &quot;gas&quot; to continue moving without changing your speed. Each die is playable exactly once each turn.

Players cannot pass each other, except on the airport spaces. If a player lands exactly on top of another player, that other player is returned to his home town.

When a player completes his assignment, he receives a card which contains the answer to that question.&#10;&#10;In the advanced version of the game, General Problems are added, which concern problems that aren&rsquo;t linked to one of the continents. Each player receives two cards describing such a problem. Cards describing the solutions are distributed among the players. In addition to completing their assignments, the players also need to find the solution to their General Problems. Certain locations on the game board offer the option to ask another player for the solution card, as do certain Action Cards. (One of these locations is New York, as headquarters of the United Nations.)&#10;&#10;The expert version of the game adds the United Nations Securtiy Council to the game. Players visiting New York can now call for a meeting of the Security Council. During such a meeting, the players vote on the positioning of UN Armies. These armies block player movement.
