Players choose one of a multitude of adventurers; their characters traverse the land encountering members of the various factions who vie for power or terrible beasts hungry for flesh &mdash; or souls. The kingdom of Westri and its inhabitants are fighting unseen forces, struggling against the grip of chaotic, entropic forces which threaten to rip apart the very fabric of the multiverse.&#10;&#10;Play solitaire or cooperative in this game of exploration, adventure, and heroism. Consult the huge volume of the gazetteer to utilize the pre-programmed paragraph system. It&rsquo;s easy to learn to play, as the programmed event sequence lets you focus on the fun of exploration as your character sets out on a quest. For each event or encounter, you, as one of the included hero player chapters, must make the decisions which will make your quest successful &mdash; or may cost you dearly. Hidden Territories has elements of a complex game designed to recapture the high adventure and heroic struggles of fantasy literature &mdash; and that famous fantasy role-playing game from the 1970s.&#10;&#10;Hidden Territories can be largely played solo, cooperatively, or even with a but of conflict between the players. But victory can only be claimed by uncovering the true nemesis of the kingdom, and defeating a final adversary. It is a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armor, artifacts &mdash; even and allies. Game play sessions extend and continue, with linked quests. Time passes, and events are influenced by player choice. Heroes must use strength at arms, guile, or negotiation to defeat a hidden and ancient evil before a magical darkness envelopes all that is good.&#10;&#10;Hidden Territories combines many different elements:&#10;&#10;     Exploration: player characters travel across the hexagonal game board to reach exciting destinations.&#10;     Random encounters: players draw encounter cards each time they enter a new hex.&#10;     Parlay, fight, or flee? many events result in opponents to negotiate with or to fight.&#10;     Random events: players draw event cards each time they enter a new tile&#10;     Leveling up: players improve their characters&rsquo; skills and knowledge of magic and gain equipment.&#10;     Paragraph Reading: an extensive plot is uncovered by reading paragraphs out of a book, discovering secrets only denizens of the kingdom know, or piecing together parts of the conspiracy puzzle. Clues help with solving mysteries and help determine how to win.&#10;&#10;&#10;Hidden Territories features a series of Event and Encounter card decks that set pace of the game and ensures players acquiring experience to level up before they are ready to take on more difficult challenges (events and enemies). Characters acquire new spells and skills as they level up from experience. Finding loot increases wealth, so more equipment, arms and armor, and other items can be acquired. Of course, travel is perilous in this wilderness hexcrawl, so provisions, foraging, and weather all impact the heroes&rsquo; progress &mdash; getting lost in the trackless wastelands can be as dangerous as stumbling about in the darkness of some ruined dungeon.&#10;&#10;Inside the box, Hidden Territories contains:&#10;&#10;     The large map game board, showing cities, villages, castles, and ruins scattered across 500 hexes means hours of game play exploration.&#10;     A huge Gazetteer that details the points of interest and other information about the hexes.&#10;     Standup figures representing archetypal warriors, knights, wizards, priests, and other fantastical characters.&#10;     Various decks of cards for events, encounters, items, spells, skills, and the denizens characters encounter. An analog artificial intelligence ensures outcomes are never fully predictable, and the storyline changes based on player choices.&#10;     Dice - lots of dice. Power up actions based on the dice pool, or sacrifice health or luck when heroic deeds are called for.&#10;     Numerous counters and chits to mark the location of encounters, hoards of loot, and other unknown obstacles to overcome. Use some of these to track weather, time, fatigue, and the ultimate countdown to doom.&#10;&#10;&#10;As scenarios play out and quests are completed, players learn lore, hear rumors, acquire knowledge, train to develop martial or magical powers. Talk, trade, or fight through bizarre encounters to unravel the dark secrets behind the impending chaos.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

What makes Runya special is the vast number of games&#10;you can find that are capable of earning your living.  Each week there are large tournaments that pay cash prizes.  Once per month in each of the 8 regions of Runya, the winners of weekly events are invited to a Regional Tournament.&#10;&#10;Regional winners are automatically entered in the annual event held in the capitol city of Liberia.  The National tournament is the largest event in the Kingdom and is played over the course of 7 days.  Players bring their avatars and compete in a series of randomly chosen game types.  Brackets include solo play as well as teams and occasionally players will be forced into co-op situations with competitors.&#10;&#10;This year, the main event of the Nationals is a new dungeon&#10;crawling game, aptly named &ldquo;Dungeon Crawlers&rdquo;.  Who will&#10;come out on top?  Let&rsquo;s find out!&#10;&#10;In this game you'll play as one of 8 Heroes from the 1st Season of the &quot;Legends of Runya&quot; series.&#10;&#10;Game Setup aka (Building the Dungeon)&#10;&#10;1. Ensure all meeples are in the drawing bag and shake them up.&#10;&#10;2. Separate and stack all the decks Floor tiles, find the 4way starting tile, then shuffle the rest and put it on top of the deck.&#10;&#10;Shop cards, shuffle all 20 shop cards and deal them into 4 stacks of 5.&#10;&#10;Potion cards, put 3 potions on top of each stack of 5 shop cards&#10;&#10;Boss/Treasure cards, With the treasure pile or boss faces UP, shuffle them blindly (Yes, this means that you will KNOW which boss is coming up. Place them strategically)&#10;&#10;3. Each player choose an avatar from the 8 Heroes.&#10;&#10;4.  The person who chose an avatar first will place the first tile in the center of your play space.  (This will be the 4way tile with blue lights in the corners).  Place 1 gem in that room and roll the Monster die to see how many monsters are in that room.  (Then draw them at random from the meeple bag.  Continue taking turns clockwise placing tiles and spawning monsters using the Monster die.  This continues until you no longer can place a tile or you have placed all of them.&#10;&#10;THE ENTIRE DUNGEON WILL BE BUILT BEFORE THE GAME BEGINS&#10;&#10;Rules for placing tiles and spawning monsters&#10;1.  You MUST place the 4way tile FIRST&#10;2.  Starter tiles must leave space for the shop cards behind them.                            &#10;3.  As long as at least ONE corridor connects, you can place a tile.&#10;           (Yes, even if 2 other corridors end at a wall)&#10;4.  When you place a starter tile, you do NOT roll the Monster die.&#10;                  (Starter tiles are free of monsters)&#10;5.  When you place a &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; tile, you do NOT roll the Monster die, instead, you take the top card from the Boss/Treasure deck and place it on that tile face-up (Monster details up, Treasure chamber picture up)&#10;6.

We provide rules for six kinds of cartoon vehicles: Conventional, Wacky, Spooky, Futuristic, Superhero, &amp; Supervillain. You choose a vehicle type &amp; a theme that fits your vehicle. Next you pay points to purchase Add-Ons (cartoon weapons, special abilities, hazards, tricks, &amp; so on) that fit your theme. A wide variety of possibilities are included so you can create (or recreate) almost any cartoon vehicle; the points system keeps them balanced.&#10;&#10;From 2 to 6 players race their toy cartoon cars using a simple simultaneous movement system; attacks are also simultaneous. Collisions &amp; attacks are resolved quickly. If a car loses all of its damage points, it Blows Up, loses some Cheers (which you collect to be able to win the race), moves back 2d6&rdquo;, then keeps on going. All of this means lots of action &amp; very little down time for players.&#10;&#10;C4 plays quickly &amp; is suitable for both younger players &amp; older players with short attention spans (like most gaming groups, in our experience). It plays faster than most other car combat games &amp; can get pretty hilarious at times.&#10;&#10;With 6 vehicle types, 6 cartoon themes, 15 customizable weapon types &amp; more than 40 customizable add-ons to choose from, you&rsquo;ll be able to create or recreate just about any &lsquo;toon vehicle imaginable &ndash; as long as you have a toy vehicle that can represent it. The points system keeps them balanced, so a Wacky baby bird in a jalopy or a beagle sitting on a doghouse with imaginary machine guns can cause just as much mayhem as a Superhero in a specially designed ubermobile.&#10;&#10;"

The board is made up of tiles placed face down at random during setup. All players begin at a shared stronghold. Players gather supplies until they feel ready to venture out to sea. Each time your ship moves it costs supplies, so the further out you venture the more expensive it is. You also use supplies to flip tiles face up discovering what is hidden underneath. What you find could be something good like an island to resupply on or search for buried treasure, or it might be pirates who ambush you and take everything in your cargo hold. Don&rsquo;t worry you can get revenge on those scurvy pirates, just resupply, sail out after them, and take back your treasure by force. The only way to ensure your treasure is safe is to get it back to the stronghold. Once there, it scores victory points for you. Until you get it back, other players can attack your ship and take it for themselves. The game is over once all of the tiles have been flipped face up.

You&rsquo;ve always wanted to fight crime like your famous ancestors, so you joined the elite BelCor forces. They turned you into a highly trained cyber-agent, but it didn&rsquo;t take you long to figure out that your bosses cared much more about their profit than about justice for ordinary people. You turned in your badge and now you live in a tiny apartment in a bad neighborhood, stripped of most of your cybernetic implants. It doesn&rsquo;t matter though, as you can finally do what a Lavel is meant to do: solve crimes and help those who can&rsquo;t count on anyone else in this merciless world.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In the standalone game Chronicles of Crime: 2400, you can use all the latest technology to solve crimes. Your pet Cyber-Raven can analyze evidence and search the web to find information on suspects. During the course of a scenario, you may also obtain cybernetic implants that would increase your abilities. Super-senses that help you find evidence on the crime scene? A tomograph to quickly check the person you&rsquo;re talking to for cyber enhancements? Or maybe a zapper to quickly neutralize any electronic device? The future is full of useful stuff!&#10;&#10;Be careful though, as the technology is not always on your side! Is the character you&rsquo;re talking to a human or an android? Who&rsquo;s hiding behind the avatars you meet in the virtual cyberspace locations? The struggle between criminals and detectives is millennia old, but at the beginning of the 25th century, it&rsquo;s been taken to a whole new level.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Paris in the year 2400! Technology has taken a giant leap forward: androids, indistinguishable from humans, walk the streets, and having cybernetic implants has slowly become the norm. Artificial intelligence plays a major role in everyone&rsquo;s daily life and, for many, Cyberspace has become a world as important as the real one.&#10;&#10;The landscape of Paris is now dominated by a gargantuan translucent Dome covering half a district. Under it, there&rsquo;s a private city on its own, created and ruled by BelCor. Only the rich and privileged can live there and enjoy comfortable houses, unlimited access to water, clean air and controlled temperature.&#10;&#10;Uneven access to new technologies, and a host of other inequalities, fuel social unrest which often turns into open violence. Paris has become a popular destination for people from regions that suffered catastrophic droughts, epidemics, and wars. It isn&rsquo;t, however, a promised land, but a merciless world where the constant fight for influence takes place on every level, from big international corporations, through political extremist groups to ordinary street gangs.&#10;&#10;Part of Chronicles of Crime - The Millennium Series&#10;Chronicles of Crime is back with a range of games called &quot;The Millennium Series&quot;. Three brand new standalone Chronicles of Crime games, working with the same great system but providing interesting gameplay twists and refreshing universes that span an entire millennium from 1400 to 1900 and finally 2400. All three games are standalone but will offer connecting narrative threads for players to discover.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
