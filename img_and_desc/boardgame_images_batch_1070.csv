An age of legends, raw magic and conflicts in the lush jungles and steaming swamps that would one day become the Mediterranean Sea. Heroes from all over the continent embarked on a Homeric quest to save the world from the threat posed by Anastyr, the queen of dragons.&#10;&#10;Anastyr is a cooperative board game with miniatures for 1 to 4 players. Each player takes on the role of a powerful hero, and your team of heroes embarks on an incredible odyssey through a world where they will face hordes of enemies and monsters, wizards and warlords, all very different depending on the environment in which they live. Each hero has their own equipment and fighting style that will each evolve during the course of their journey; all hoping to be powerful enough to face the ultimate threat at the end of this epic, adventure-filled campaign! During their quest, heroes will ride a variety of mounts (horses, raptors, saber-toothed tigers and other exotic creatures) that will give them special advantages, and their combat skills and ability to coordinate with their companions will be tested constantly.&#10;&#10;Anastyr has some particularly immersive innovations, such as scrolling tiles, interchangeable magnetic mounts, and backdrops that turn your game board into a beautiful diorama. The game features a dynamic mix of playing cards and special dice to roll and introduces combat mechanics loosely based on brawler video games. Heroes eliminate their opponents by unleashing fearsome combos. But they will also be able to ravage the battlefield with their Fury, a devastating attack resulting from unleashing their rage that has accumulated over the course of the battle. Each hero has a unique deck, which reflects their individual fighting style. And in the campaign mode, this deck can be improved by the player by the addition of new cards they can choose which will reflect the evolution and the leveling up of the hero over time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589. The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.&#10;&#10;This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are with areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.&#10;&#10;The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; en haie &raquo; (in hedge), the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the three battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible...
