Deal 5 cards to each player, and put the rest in a face-down stack. A starting card from the top of the face-down stack is turned face-up on the table. Each player takes turns playing a card on top of the face-up stack, which must match either the symbol, color, or number of the current top card in that stack. If you don't have a matching card, you have to draw from the face-down stack. There are action cards which trigger changes in the game when played. Minimum number of players is 2.&#10;&#10;It also comes with a second set of rules for the same 32 cards, called Happy Families or Quartets. The goal of this game is to collect as many families as possible (groups of 4 cards that belong together). With 2 players, deal 10 cards to each player, and place the remaining 12 cards in a face-down stack. One player begins by asking for a certain card; they must already have at least one card from that family. If the opponent does not have that card, then the player picks up the top card from the stack, and then it is the other player's turn. Or with 3 or more players, deal out all the cards equally among the players; and a player can continue asking for cards from selected opponents until they make a mistake (asking for a card that the person asked doesn't have). Whoever collects the most sets of 4 wins.&#10;&#10;--user summary&#10;&#10;"

As in the original Table Battles game &mdash; which apparently is going to be called &quot;Human Table Battles&quot; from now on &mdash; players roll dice, then assign them to cards representing their fighting forces. Removing the dice triggers an attack, but that attack might be reacted to &mdash; whether absorbed, blocked, or countered &mdash; if the opposing player removes dice from a card with a reaction. The trick is that if you can react, you must react, and if you do react, you don't get to attack on your next turn. Mastering tempo is key to your success.&#10;&#10;The thing about this game, though, is that it has dinosaurs, and dinosaurs are pretty big guys and gals &mdash; so big, in fact, that each dino spans two or three cards, giving them an assortment of attacks, reactions, and rule-breaking special abilities. During set-up, players draft a team of dinosaurs, creating unique synergies to be exploited and disadvantages to be mitigated. There are over 900,000 different matches possible, and while that might not be enough to keep you occupied for 200 million years, it's probably close enough.&#10;&#10;"

Your team must work together to balance your budget, your grid stability, and your public opinion to keep the lights on, win elections, overcome climate impacts, and build 16 gigawatts of clean power for the city. Then you will have replaced all fossil fuels, provided there is a matching reduction in demand from behavior change and efficiency.&#10;&#10;Our objective is to give players a quick grounding in what solving climate change actually means, in a physical and social sense, based on demand of energy and the types of renewable or carbon neutral generation that can supply 8 million New Yorkers.&#10;&#10;As you play, one thing you'll realize is that this problem is big, and our response must be too. This means, among other things, that it will be visible. Playing a single Solar piece represents building a piece of infrastructure nearly half the size of Manhattan. Playing a single Wind piece represents the construction of 167 metal structures, each nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower, miles off the Long Island coast.&#10;&#10;We hope playing this game can make your role in the coming decade more effective, better informed, and more powerful, and that by providing a tangible vision of what part of the solution looks like, society can begin the necessary step of reorienting itself towards this larger goal.

Tiles can be enemies, quest items, gold or bonuses.

Each card shows the character's hit points, inventory space, which dice they use to attack and defend (4, 6 or 8 faces). Each character also has a different set of tokens which represent which actions they can do.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence is players play first, then monsters.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, each player secretly choose their 3 actions at the same time, then they reveal the 3 actions together.&#10;&#10;Turn order is always the same : Ruel plays first, then it's Tristepin, Evangeline and Yugo last.&#10;&#10;Every player plays one action in this order until everyone has played their 3 actions.&#10;&#10;Actions are : &#10;- movement : When a character arrives on a quarter of the board, all the tiles of that quarter are turned face up.&#10;&#10;- hand to hand or bow attack : to attack, the player rolls the corresponding dice as shown on their character's card. If it's higher than the monster's armor, the player wins and the monster tile is discarded and the player earns money.&#10;&#10;- spell : only yugo has the spell action which he can use to teleport.&#10;&#10;- gift an item to someone (so they can heal or to have more room in the inventory)&#10;&#10;When everyone has played their 3 actions it's the monsters' turn: Each player has a monster color, randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. Each player moves and makes an attack with the monster which is on a tile the color he has.&#10;&#10;Monsters always attack in the same way. Monsters who are on a red tile attacks Tristepin, yellow attack Ruel, green attack Evangeline and Blue attack Yugo.&#10;&#10;Monsters attack the same way the players do. If the monsters are successful, the player attacked loses hit points on their character's card.&#10;&#10;The game continue this way until the scenario goal is reached (all the players win) or until one of the players has no more hit point (all the players lose).&#10;&#10;&quot;Choose your favorite character and make a team ready to fight the terrible Bouftous.&#10;Together, Tristepin, Yugo, Evangelyne and Ruel will overcome thrilling quests!&#10;Your missions?
