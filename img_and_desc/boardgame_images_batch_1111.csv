Each player takes over one kid out of a ragtag group of survivors and enters the world of a stodgy 90s suburb - where kids' dreams quite literally become reality. The goal is to fight back the monsters borne from the children's own subconsciousness, before the horde of evil dreams swallows the town completely.&#10;&#10;To make matters worse, each kid is haunted by their very own primal fear, drafted randomly at the games' beginning out of a pool of six: The fears of loneliness, illness, pain, darkness, deceipt and decay. Starting as mere forebodings, these Grand Nightmares grow stronger and gain abilities at the end of each round, the pace heavily depends on the decisions of the players. At some point the primal fears manifest themselves and enter the game board to lead their minions against the last remaining refuge: the childrens' headquarters in the attic of an empty house. A game is lost once a Grand Nightmare and its pack reaches the headquarters and the subsequent battle is lost by the players.&#10;&#10;To avoid that outcome, the players must use their rounds &ndash; each representing a day, from dawn to dusk - to break the curse cast upon their formerly cozy town.

By end of 1915 the forces of President Carranza were arrayed against a variety of leaders supporting either themselves or General Victoriano Huerta. Pancho Villa, commander of the Mexican Army del Norte, at first supported Carranza, but then went rogue after the US Government recognized Carranza&rsquo;s government. Historians still debate Villa&rsquo;s reasons, but in early March 1916 he decided to enter the US and raid the town of Columbus, New Mexico. Although the town was where the 13th Regiment US Cavalry was garrisoned, he knew most of the troopers were scattered along the border. Believing the town was only weakly guarded, his force of just under 500 men were to steal arms, provisions and horses while also wreaking as much havoc as possible. Such a raid he believed could galvanize the US government into a retaliatory strike that would drag Carranza&rsquo;s government into a war with the US it could not win, or a humiliating capitulation that would outrage the Mexican people. Either way, Villa reasoned, it would mean the downfall of Carranza.&#10;&#10;Villa&rsquo;s Vengeance is an introductory level wargame simulation portraying the March 9, 1916 raid on Columbus, New Mexico. Players are cast in the roles of Villa&rsquo;s raiding force and the defending US regular and militia forces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The God, who is no longer satisfied with the underworld, wants to send his monsters to the real world to expand his power.&#10;&#10;The Players begin the game with 45 Timestones (life total) 10 starter cards, 6 of which grant seed power (purchase new cards) and 4 have song power (attack). As players buy GOTHIE (creature) cards and Land (shield) cards from the Mercado (tableau) they add them to their decks, where they can achieve synergy bonuses based on the heart rune of the cards played. The game plays similarly to other head-to-head deckbuilders in this respect, but can be converted to play cooperatively using the same deckbuilding mechanics.&#10;&#10;In the coop mode, this plays very similar to a tower defense game like Castle Panic, but the threats all come from a single direction, and the monsters can attack the well and &quot;possess&quot; the GOTHIES that the players have in their played card zone. This ups the difficulty because the players' former GOTHIE cards now fight against them until they are restored.&#10;&#10;The game is for 2 players, and can be expanded to 4 with two sets. The game comes with 162 cards and counters to track timestones.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

If quick play is what you&rsquo;re looking for, the Tournament Mode module will let you simulate the early and middle rounds of an entire tournament in about 20 minutes, reducing the field to a handful of finalists. You can then use the &ldquo;For The Set&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Rally&rdquo; modules to resolve the remaining tournament matches in 10 to 20 minutes more.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re looking for detail, the &ldquo;point-by-point&rdquo; module will let you watch the action unfold as if you were courtside, with serves, returns, difficult shots, winners, momentum and even unusual and rare results.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;For the Set&rdquo; module is the main tool in the box. It serves as a bridge between the two extremes of speed and detail. It will instantly resolve the preliminary action of a set and take you to the potential set-deciding game--one player with the opportunity to win the sixth and deciding game of the set. From there, you can get to your final result with extended drama, point-by-point, or instantly via the &ldquo;No Rally&rdquo; results.&#10;&#10;"
