As good healthcare professionals you have the mission of thwarting this threat. Your city depends on you! Micro-Combat is a game of cooperation - you can only overcome these pathogens by working together!&#10;&#10;Micro-Combat is a game designed to work among the young population on the subject of infectious diseases and to understanding the causes and risk factors for antimicrobial resistance.&#10;&#10;In Micro-Combat you will play the role of health authorities who have the mission of thwarting the attack of pathogenic agents (virus, bacteria, fungi and parasites) which can make the population of your city ill. Your goal is to avoid any of the characters in the game losing all their defenses, and to do this you will have different preventive measures and medications... which are not always enough.&#10;&#10;The game has 3 types of cards: character cards, attack cards (pathogens, &quot;out of stock&quot; cards and antimicrobial resistance cards) and defense cards (prevention measures and medications)&#10;At the start of the game, 5 characters are chosen at random and placed in the center of the table. Each character has some defense points and an innate prevention measure.&#10;&#10;The game consists in using the defense cards in order to stop the characters from losing their defense points due to the effects of the pathogen cards. Everyone plays at the same time, with no turns or player order. The pathogens are defeated through player cooperation. The game consists of 6 rounds. Each round includes the following phases: exposure (to pathogens); prevention and treatment; infection and contagion. If a character reaches zero defense points, the players lose the game.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

A system of viable exoplanets has been recently discovered and the Confederations are flocking into space to colonize it. In this 2 to 4-player development and flow-management board game, you play the leader of one of these Confederations and play your influence in the Odyssey command station to send as many of your settlers as you can on these exoplanets.&#10;&#10;After decades of research and technological development, humanity is preparing to leave the Earth to colonize this discovered system. To get there, only one possible means of transport exists: space gates. For reasons related to physics and other quantum aspects, these gates can be built only in space. The Confederations have therefore embarked on the construction of their own station in orbit, equipped with space gates.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the colonizing era, these portals make it possible to go on one of the first three discovered planets. As soon as an entire contingent of settlers has joined the gate of a space station, it is teleported to the corresponding exoplanet. The landing conditions vary according to the planets and the choice of colonized spots quickly becomes strategic.&#10;&#10;As soon as one of the three exoplanets is fully colonized, each Confederation gains influence according to its placement, then access to one of the two later discovered exoplanets becomes possible. At the end of the colonization of the five exoplanets, the stations are teleported to the Hawking planet and the influence of each Confederation is assessed. The leader of the most influential Confederation will be promoted to the rank of Governor of this new system.&#10;&#10;One of the biggest challenges in Space Gate Odyssey is your ability to quickly develop and intelligently arrange your space station. The better you optimize the flow of your settlers to your station, then to the exoplanets, the more of them you can send to the favorable spots and thus gain influence.&#10;&#10;The choice of the modules, their arrangement, and the distance between the airlocks and the gates are therefore essential elements &mdash; especially since, at the end of the game, the domains of the modules you used to build your station will bring you additional influence points if they are in line with the position of the domains on the Hawking planet Predominance.&#10;&#10;Finally, you must be careful not to leave too many open corridors on the space void as this represents a real danger for your settlers and could therefore damage your reputation.&#10;&#10;Your most amazing quest starts with Space Gate Odyssey. Will you be able to take over your opponents in order to take control of the new system, or will you stay at the dock?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.&#10;&#10;Based on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.&#10;&#10;As a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!&#10;&#10;After you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.&#10;After you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.&#10;&#10;Note: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.&#10;&#10;If you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;As a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.&#10;&#10;"

The Voronezh Front of Vatutin had the mission of charging on Kiev and destroying the 4. Panzerarmee.&#10;On 21 September, the 3rd Guards Tank Army reached the Dnieper and established a bridgehead at Bukrin, near Kanev, soon joined by the 27th and 70th Armies. On 26 September, the Soviets dropped two paratrooper brigades on Kanev. The operation was a disaster. Meanwhile, the 38th Army forced the river at Lyutezh, 20 km north of Kiev.&#10;The Soviets launched another operation from Bukrin mid-October with no result. The Stavka realised the tactical impasse of this bridgehead and decided &ndash; in absolute secrecy &ndash; to transfer Rybalko&rsquo;s 3rd Guards Tank Army into the pocket of Lyutezh.&#10;Vatutin prepared a large-scale attack on Kiev. On 3 November, more than 2000 canons discharged a flood of fire on the units of the VII. and XIII.

Farther north, the 60th Army attacked in the direction of Korosten.&#10;Despite the counter-attacks of the 7. and 8. Panzer and of the 20th Pz.Grenadier, Rybalko&rsquo;s men entered Kiev and completely liberated it on 6 November. Fastov fell on 7 November, and the Soviet troops advanced on the entire Front. Jitomir fell at the hands of the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps on 12 November. The Soviets advanced more than 120 km to the west!&#10;The Germans sent reinforcements from everywhere. The 25.

The player who&rsquo;s card has the greatest number of letters is the dealer. &#10;The dealer shuffles the deck and gives each player 7 cards.&#10;&#10;Then places the remainder of the deck face down to create a &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile. &#10;The dealer takes the top card off the &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile and puts it face up, to begin the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile.&#10;&#10;START PLAYING&#10;The person to the left of the dealer begins the game.&#10;&#10;When it&rsquo;s your turn you must put down a card matching the top card on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile, either being the same type of word (adjective, noun, verb or conjunction) or having a matching punctuation sign&#10;(!   ,   ?   &lsquo;   :   &ldquo;&rdquo;  . ). &#10;You can also put down any &lsquo;action card&rsquo; (see action card).&#10;&nbsp;&#10;EXAMPLE: If the top card on the &ldquo;put down&rsquo; pile is the word &lsquo;happy&rsquo; with a : on it, the next person must put down either another adjective card, a card with a : on it or a action card (see Action Cards).&#10;&nbsp;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t have a card that matches the card on top of the &lsquo;put down&rsquo;  pile you must pick up a card from the top of the &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; pile.

If the word is spelt correctly, the card is placed on the &lsquo;put down&rsquo; pile and the speller takes his turn. If the word is spelt incorrectly, the card is given to the speller and they miss their turn. The next player in the sequence then starts their turn.&#10;&#10;WINNING&#10;The first person to get rid of all their cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

If you do not have a higher level attack or protection card, you die and your opponent get credit for killing your type of monster.

If that sounds complicated, the truth is actually quite otherwise.&#10;&#10;The twin protocols, NEC and NON, are acronyms for 'Not Even Close' and 'No Odd Neighbours'. The difference between them, as their names quirkily suggest, is that in NEC you may never lay a stone next to an even number of enemy stones, whereas in NON it&rsquo;s odd numbers that are off limits. Either way, a placement next to no enemy stones at all is fine.&#10;&#10;NECNON is a very close cousin to the classic game of Go. Contributing stones alternately to a grid whose cells may be either hexagonal or square, the players (Black and Green) gradually fill up the playing space. The objective is to deprive enemy groups (including enemy singletons) of &lsquo;air&rsquo; &ndash; i.e., of the vacant adjacent cells which in Go would be called &lsquo;liberties&rsquo;. At the end, any groups thus &lsquo;smothered&rsquo; score points for the smotherer at the rate of one per stone, and the player with more points wins. If scores are level the game is drawn.&#10;&#10;Note: NECNON is a pure placement game; no capturing occurs during play.&#10;&#10;A great deal of variety stems from a series of decisions made before play begins: whether to choose hexagons or squares; what size of board to use; and whether to go for NEC, or NON, or NEC versus NON. In all cases, Black (who starts) lays one stone on the initially empty board, and thereafter both players lay two at every turn. Passing is only permitted if unavoidable, and the game ends when both players pass consecutively, or when the board is full.  That&rsquo;s it.&#10;&#10;Play NECNON online against a human or a virtual opponent at Stephen Tavener&rsquo;s wonderful Ai Ai site: http://mrraow.com/.index.php/aiai-home/aiai/ .&#10;&#10;"

The reveal of a Draw card indicates the player is entering the shooting phase by drawing their gun to shoot at their opponent, and can then prevent their opponent revealing their next card by touching one of their opponents cards before their opponent chooses their next card (which ought to be a Draw card if they want to shoot too!).&#10;The shooting phase is affected by whether one or both players get to resolve their shots (determined by reactions speeds to touching cards after  a Draw card is revealed). If both players managed to reveal a Draw card, they compare speed values(total from Draw and Modifier cards), with highest value shooting first. Players hit their opponent with a shot by rolling their dice and adding this to their accuracy value (total from Draw and Modifier cards), requiring a total of 6 and higher or &quot;hit&quot; symbol. &#10;Then, at the end of each round, players discard the cards they revealed in the round and can choose their next six cards from any of their remaining cards.&#10;&#10;Players score 1 point for hitting their opponent, with a bonus 1 point if they revealed their Draw card second.

The first player flicks all of their ships once.&#10;4. The second player then flicks all of their ships once.&#10;5. Play continues like this with each player only being able to flick their mobile ships (right way up).&#10;&#10;Beyond flicking to move, spaceships in MAG-Wars can do a number of different things. Here is a list of some of the potential actions that can be declared during a battle:&#10;&#10;A. Attack - You can flick a ship at an enemy and if it makes contact, that enemy ship loses power and is immobilised (placed with its tail end down on the table).&#10;B. Assist - If you have an immobilised ship on the table, you may declare assist, rotate that ship to the angle required and then flick a ship at it to try and knock it back down (power it up). If successful, that ship may be flicked this turn as normal (chaining multiple assist flicks can potentially power your entire team back up in one turn).&#10;C. Repair - Some ships need only make contact with a powered down ship to be able to power it back up and get it flicking again.&#10;D. Dock - Certain ships have the ability to dock with other ships. If this is declared and the flick successfully makes contact with an appropriate target (varies per ship), then the two become docked together.&#10;A docked ship can be:&#10;- Towed to its enemy&rsquo;s portal and captured (removing it from the game),&#10;- Boarded and looted,&#10;- Did I mention these ships TRANSFORM!!!&#10;Well actually they can be combined together in various different combinations. Should a player declare &lsquo;dock&rsquo; and then make contact to the appropriate ship, the two ship models can be temporarily combined to form a &lsquo;Hyper Ship&rsquo; with a very powerful and unique ability.&#10;&#10;To win the game you must either:&#10;Knock/have all your opponent&rsquo;s ships immobilised,&#10;Fulfill all three of your hidden objective cards,&#10;Have the highest total ore value when all ore has been collected.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
