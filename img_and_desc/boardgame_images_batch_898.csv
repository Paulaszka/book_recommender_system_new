You may never place a card so it forms a fifth row or column if you are not able to clear a row or column of cards from the board.&#10;&#10;Clear a column or row&#10;If you place a card in a position so there forms either a fifth row or column, you must remove the opposite row or column. But you could only remove a row or column that consists of as many or fewer cards as you just flipped over. If the row or column on the opposite side is of more cards than you would manage to flip, it could not be removed, and you would not be allowed to place your card in this position. Cards removed from the board is returned to the players' hands. If you are not able to shift the grid, you must place your card within the current.&#10;&#10;Game endings&#10;The game ends when a player cannot place a card so that cards on the table are flipped over OR when the grid is completed and the player can not add a new card. In the latter case, the player would need to be able to shift the grid and remove a column or a row.&#10;&#10;The player with most of its own colour facing up is the winner of the game. If there is a tie of colours facing up, the game ended in a tie.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"
