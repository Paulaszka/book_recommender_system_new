After launching Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22nd, the First Panzer Group of the German Sixth Army led the offensive into the Ukraine. Critical to the German success in the opening days was taking the main road leading to Kiev and Kharkov, and the bridges spanning the Ikva and Styr rivers. Any delays or setbacks here could have severe repercussions as the other German Army Groups and panzer formations drove deeper along Sixth Army&rsquo;s flanks. Desperate to stop the German blitzkrieg, Joseph Stalin, over the objections of General Zhukov, ordered an immediate counter-attack. The largest tank battle of the war to that date was the result. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;A complete game of A Long, Hard Road is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch map sections&#10;&bull;    279 double-sided, un-mounted counters.&#10;&bull;    One players&rsquo; aide sheet&#10;&bull;    8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Players will also need one six (D6) and one ten-sided (D10) dice to play the game. Each day turn of the game represents 8 hours of time.  Units are mostly brigades and regiments. Each hex is approximately 1.25 miles across.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"

They demand that all resources be divided rightfully among them. The stronger ones are taking more than the weak. That&rsquo;s wrong! But, who will ensure that peace prevails? The winner of this battle of wits will be the King of the Jungle!&#10;&#10;Fracto is a 3-in-1 card game to learn operations with fractions. It has a set of 80 playing cards. There are 3 kinds of fraction cards - number cards, image cards and word cards.When the sum of two fraction cards is equal to 1, it is called a whole pair. For example:  &#226;&#133;&#147; + &#226;&#133;&#148; = 1 : so, the fractions &#226;&#133;&#147; , &#226;&#133;&#148;  together forms a whole pair. where as &#226;&#133;&#154; + 2/6 = 7/6, so the fraction &#226;&#133;&#154; + 2/6 does not form a whole pair. Remember, here you can make whole pairs using only two fraction cards. The three different gameplay of fracto are: Whole-in-1, Deck of Fortune and Memory Hero. &#10;Let&rsquo;s look at the first gameplay: To play Whole-in-1, shuffle the cards and distribute 8 cards to each player. These are the hand cards. The main deck is placed face down in the centre of the table. Check your hand cards if you can make any whole pairs. if you can, then place the pairs face down on the table in front of you.At any given point in the game, you must have even number of hand cards. Pick the top card from the main deck. place it face up on the table. This is the discard pile. The player on the left of the dealer starts the game and it continues clockwise. On your turn, you can either pick up the top card from the discard pile or the top card from the main deck. Check if you can make a whole pair using the new card. if yes, then place the whole pair, face down, in front of you and discard any card from your hand cards into the discard pile. if you cannot make a pair, then put any of your hand cards into the discard pile. The turn moves to the next player. You must call out &ldquo;fracto&rdquo; whenever you have only 2 hand cards. This is applicable even at the start of the game. if you do not call out &ldquo;fracto&rdquo; and you are caught by another player, you must draw four cards from the main deck. You finish when you have made whole pairs with all your hand cards. There will be one card remaining, which will be discarded into the discard pile. When you have made all the whole pairs, you must show the whole pairs to the other players. If you have  made a wrong whole pair, you need to draw four cards from the main deck. you must also pick up the incorrect pairs and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Let&rsquo;s look at the second gameplay: To play Deck of Fortune, shuffle the cards and distribute equally until all cards are over, amongst all players. All the cards are dealt face down. you are not allowed to see your cards. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game. The game continues clockwise. On your turn, you pick up the top card from your player deck and place it face up on the table. This is the discard pile. You check whether the card placed forms a whole pair with the card below it. if it does, you pick up the entire discard pile and place it below your player deck. if it does not, the game continues and the next player places their card. This continues until a player completely finishes their player deck.&#10;&#10;Let&rsquo;s look at the third gameplay: To play Memory Hero, remove the red cards from the deck. Make a deck of blue and green cards. shuffle the two decks separately. Distribute 7 blue cards to each player. These are the hand cards. you can see your hand cards. Take 16 green cards and arrange them, face down, in a grid of 4 by 4.These are the table cards. The remaining green cards are kept separately as the main deck. The player to the left of the dealer starts the game and the game continues clockwise. On your turn, you will open any one table card, so that everyone can see it. If the table card forms a whole pair with any one of your hand cards then pick up that card, show the pair to everyone and set the pair aside. If you cannot form a whole pair, you keep the card back facing down. the game continues. Once a table card is used you must replace it with another card from the main deck, facing down. You can only combine one hand card with one table card. You can open a table card only on your turn. The game ends when a player completes all their hand cards.&#10;&#10;The perfect educational family entertainer with three engaging games packed in a single set! Fracto provides your kids with a blend of academics, life skills and moral values while they have loads of fun.

No two campaigns are ever the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;In a game session of U.S.S. Freedom, you continue your journey from where you left off the session before&mdash;think of it like watching a single episode of a sci-fi TV series. A game session consists of five phases.&#10;&#10;Interstellar Phase&#10;Set up the Interstellar Board with all the miniatures in their positions from your previous game session. Then, the various Spaceships and Titans move. If they did not move onto the same hex as your ship, then it is time for you to move.&#10;&#10;Navigate Phase&#10;Your ship may move toward any adjacent hex.  Your ship scanners warn you of what lies in all directions. Create the Encounter Deck by shuffling all cards of your level that belong to your adjacent sectors. Then you randomly place one card in each direction. Look at the different Encounters you have and select one to move toward.&#10;&#10;Encounter Phase&#10;After selecting the Encounter you will face, roll the Encounter Roll. If the Encounter is an Alien Colony or Alien Starship, add your Reputation to the result. You then flip the Encounter Card and see how it plays according to the Encounter Result and the nature of your Encounter. Some Aliens may simply attack you while others may offer you Missions.&#10;&#10;Combat Phase&#10;A lot of Encounters will lead to combat, whether through Missions or direct conflict. Some battles will be carried out by the U.S.S. Freedom, while in other cases your heroes will have to fight on the planet surface, in enemy bases, or even inside the U.S.S. Freedom. Sometimes battles may be carried out simultaneously with the U.S.S. Freedom fighting in space while an away team fights a ground battle.&#10;&#10;Each kind of enemy has different abilities that they use during the battle, revealed by flipping the top chip from the stack of Enemy Ability Chips.&#10;&#10;Luckily, your heroes also have abilities. They are used for everything from attacks on the enemies to using skills such as Engineering or Willpower. Heroes use their Aether to activate their abilities. Each player has an Aether Pouch and draws different colored Crystals representing the Aether that empowers the heroes&rsquo; Abilities.&#10;&#10;In space combat, heroes use the Engine to produce Power and distribute it to all decks of the ship. Heroes across the ship use this Power to fly the Starship, attacking with Weapons or raising Shields.&#10;&#10;Conclude Phase&#10;Succeeding enables you to continue your mission. You get rewards according to the Encounter, you may trade commodities, or you may even get to upgrade your ship.&#10;&#10;This will conclude one game session. You may pack everything into your Campaign pouch and continue another day from where you left. Or&hellip;if you have another hour, you could play just one more game session!&#10;&#10;"

Game play usually takes less than an hour, but the players can adjust the game to last far shorter or far longer depending on time constraints. Since only basic reading and math are required, the game is suited for ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;Thoroughly analyzed and using equations based on armor plating, speed, and destructive capabilities, Damage Points determine what it takes to bring one of these monsters down and Value Points dictate scores at the end of the game.  The basic set comes with 54 tank cards with distribution reflective of the actual numbers of each type of tank employed in battle.&#10;&#10;Players utilize their Action Cards to fire weapons at the formations of their opponents, send in Air Strikes and Infantry Attacks, plant Mine Fields against their enemies, repair their tanks with Damage Control, use Evasive Maneuvers to avoid incoming fire, protect themselves from above with Air Cover, and even Retreat from battle entirely. When the going gets rough, players can also use Additional Tank cards to strengthen their formation.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Let your fleet perform actions like maneuvering, attacking and launching carrier aircraft but also special Command station actions that will allow your fleet to perform above and beyond the call of duty: Perform evasive maneuvers as a response to enemy fire or appeal to the British sense of duty to keep your ship in the fight when others would have broken off. Try to place that one critical hit or lay down smoke to shield your carriers from enemy fire.&#10;&#10;You are however not the only hero in this game; your opponent may (and will) try to disrupt your actions which may result in your attempt at flank speed backfiring because of an engine malfunction! This dynamic, in combination with the activation-based game sequence makes sure both players stay continually involved in the game. It also allows the players to have just that little bit of extra influence on Lady Luck. Underlying all this are solid game mechanics for modeling surface combat, air attacks and submarine actions with a balance between simplicity, gaming comfort and realistic outcomes.&#10;&#10;Naval War is a so-called &lsquo;living rule-set&rsquo; so any suggestions, feedback and additions are taken very seriously resulting in regular updates and expansions.

It is based on a game that exists in his book series. It resembles a rustic game made by strange beings from another imaginary world. It plays like a combination of stratego and chess while capturing the randomizing excitement of being dealt a hand of cards.&#10;&#10;It begins when you roll all 16 of your 6-sided &quot;ballit&quot; game pieces, creating one of over 20,000 possible combinations. Gain victory by one of two paths: capturing all your opponent&rsquo;s Moons and Stars, or reaching your opponent&rsquo;s Treasure Stone. Use Paths, Safes, Pits, and Traps to change how Moons and Stars move around the board. Once the board is set, choose from a number of Deity Figurines that progress along notches in the board and unlock a variety of bonus abilities. The player with the best strategy wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

There was a successful movie starring Mel Gibson made about this well-known battle for the Landing Zone.  The game is challenging for both sides and historically accurate, but only takes a few hours and can be played at one sitting.&#10;&#10;They Were Soldiers: Battle of the Ia Drang Valley lasts 15 turns. Each turn, players alternate moving and attacking each other&rsquo;s forces on the game map, which is divided into hexes. Combat can include small arms firefights between adjacent units or fire missions that target hexes with artillery, airstrikes, helicopter gunships and mortars.&#10;&#10;At the end of the combat phase, once all fire combat is complete, adjacent units may conduct close quarters combat (CQC) to decide which force will occupy contested hexes.&#10;&#10;Each turn, after all movement and combat is completed, both sides draw cards to determine special actions for the future turns and may get reinforcements according to a preset schedule based on the history of the battle.&#10;&#10;History - At 10:48 A.M. on the morning of November 14th, 1965, the first 80 soldiers of the 1st Battalion of the U.S. 7th Cavalry landed in a small clearing at the foot of the Chu Pong Massif in central Vietnam near the Cambodian border.  The Americans had landed in the middle of the base area for an entire North Vietnamese division, and were almost immediately attacked from multiple sides of their small landing zone - called &lsquo;LZ X-Ray&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The battle raged over the next several days, with high losses on both sides.  In the end, the Americans had proved their new airmobility tactics and had inflicted high losses on the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldiers they faced.  The NVA had also learned how to fight the Americans - and had inflicted serious losses on a high-tech superpower enemy  by using classic light infantry tactics with only a fraction of the firepower available to the Americans.&#10;&#10;This game challenges the players to re-fight the first day or so of that battle - the critical time when the NVA forces had the chance to overwhelm the Americans and overrun the landing zone.  Can you, as the U.S. player, hold your ground and repeat history?  Or will the NVA player triumph and overwhelm the perimeter - cutting the Americans off from supply and reinforcement?  Get ready to re-live or re-write history in the battle for LZ-Xray!&#10;&#10;"

You are trying to have your design chosen by the Elitist of Elites to have your Hedge Maze used at their new vacation home.&#10;&#10;Everybody is given a player board with a cover so that your design is kept secretive.
