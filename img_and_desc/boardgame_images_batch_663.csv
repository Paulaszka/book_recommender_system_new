When a player lands on an activity space, he may purchase that activity for the designated cost.  He may then purchase up to two upgrades (which are called &quot;reserved tables,&quot; &quot;group reservations,&quot; etc.) either immediately or on a later turn.  When other players land on these spaces, they must pay the owner the amount designated on the card.&#10;&#10;A few extra wrinkles are added.  Detour spaces place a player onto an alternate track when they are landed on.  &quot;Go Trojans Go!&quot; and &quot;We Are SC&quot; cards can give players extra money, take away money or offer other benefits or detriments.  Parking Lot spaces cause loss of a turn, and various other spaces may increase or decrease the player's money total.  Passing the start space, unlike in Monopoly, costs the player $600.&#10;&#10;Players start with $6000 each (tracked on paper--no paper money is included) and try to gain funds as they play.  Landing on other players' spaces forces a player to pay them a designated amount.  If a player cannot pay, he or she may sell any assets owned to other players or give them back to the bank for half value.  If still unable to pay in full, the player is out of the game.  The game can be played to one of three pre-agreed ending conditions--a time limit, until one or more player are eliminated or until only player is left.  The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Optional rules allow a player to move another player back to the starting space by landing on their pawn and allow for discounted purchase of upgrades on spaces if matching sets are collected.&#10;&#10;A metagame rule governs the use of a &quot;Trojan Gold&quot; space.  If a player lands on this space and agrees to donate a pre-determined amount of real (not in-game) money to the real University of Southern California, he or she gains an upgrade to place on any owned property.&#10;&#10;"

At the end of the Foe phase, the party of Heroes may collectively choose a card in the city to refresh, making other options available for the next turn.&#10;&#10;After the Foe phase is complete, the party of Heroes begin their turns.

This allows you to get answers for problems when you need them.&#10;&#10;The deck building element in Foe Hunters revolves around the City Deck. This deck has several cards that are available for purchase. Many of these cards have a class affinity, which allows the Hero that matches the class to purchase the card for a discount.&#10;&#10;Foe Hunters is a new take on co-op that mixes a lightweight system with the complexity of an in-depth deck building game or card game!&#10;&#10;"

Some cards are worth more than others though, so be strategic about which cards you decide to &ldquo;Swipe&rdquo; from your foes!&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, and in one single round only four &quot;Master Points&quot; are available for players to win, either splitting the points between the players, or one player winning them all. Rounds continue until a single player reaches five Master Points, in which they win the game. The four Master Points in any given round consist of the following: 1) Master Number Point 2) Master Color Point 3) Master Shape Point and 4) Master Total Point.&#10;&#10;The game starts out with the dealer revealing the &quot;Master Card&quot; for that round (which is a Power Card that gets placed in the center of the playing field). The Master Card will have a number (1-10), a color (red,blue,purple,green), and a shape (X,O). Whatever the elements might be are what dictate the four ways to earn the &quot;Master Points&quot; in that round. For example: If the dealer reveals the Master Card that has the number 7, the color red, and the shape X, then players must steal cards from each other that have any of those elements (7s, reds, X's) and always high numbered cards. At the end of a round, players will reveal to each other all of the cards they have acquired throughout the round. In this example, the player who acquired the most cards with the number 7 wins the Master Number Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the color red wins the Master Color Point, the player who acquired the most cards with the shape X wins the Master Shape Point, and the player who acquired the highest sum after adding up the numbers on all acquired cards wins the Master Total Point.&#10;&#10;There are only two main types of cards in Swipe it!&trade; There are the Power Cards (cards with a number, a color, and a shape; one of these cards gets promoted to master card at the beginning of the round) and then there are the Swipe Cards which have an &quot;S&quot; and a swipe arrow . Players need to combine one of each type of cards in order to initiate an attack against another player. Players can only acquire Power Cards from each other in order to gain points, where Swipe Cards simply allow the player's Power Cards to make an attack. In Swipe it!&trade; a combined pair (a Power Card combined with a Swipe Card) can always freely attack a lower numbered Power Card or enemy pair. Example: a 10 on a Black Swipe Card can freely attack an opponent's 9 on a Black Swipe Card). Now the intensity rises when you are using a combined pair to attack a higher numbered Power Card or enemy pair. This is where the dice and rock-paper-scissors comes into effect, where essentially the attacker is wagering their lower numbered Power Card in a series of battles against their opponent's higher numbered Power Card. If the attacker loses, their opponent acquires the attacker's Power Card in play. This is especially huge when the attacker is risking their Power Card that happens to match the &quot;Master Number&quot;, &quot;Master Color&quot;, &quot;Master Shape&quot;, or is a high numbered card like a 9 or 10. On the other hand, if the attacker is wagering a Power Card that is low like the number 1 and does not match any of the Master Point categories, then who cares if they lose to their enemy right? The attacker may as well take the risk with that type of card in order try and win a great one.&#10;&#10;There are also three different types of Swipe Cards (Black, Silver, and Gold) each one offering unique abilities; such as the Gold Swipe Card raising your Power card by +2 when it is attacking and by +1 when on defense, or the Silver Swipe Card granting the ability to &quot;Punish&quot; another player's Swipe Card, or being able to &quot;Reassign&quot; a combined pair with a different Power card (if you had a 1 combined with Silver Swipe Card, you can switch it to lets say a 10 on the Silver Swipe Card allowing you to attack higher numbered enemy cards for free). There are also some special rules too, such as &quot;merge&quot;, &quot;master merge&quot;, and &quot;cash-in&quot; which can help players out of some sticky situations. A &quot;merge&quot; allows you to combine two Power Cards that share the same number (such as combining a 9 with another 9), forcing the combined cards to act as if it were a Black Swipe card, giving you the ability to combine a third Power Card to it to make an attack. &quot;Master merge&quot; is the same as a &quot;merge&quot; with the exception that the combined cards match the &quot;Master Number&quot; in play, forcing them to act as if it were a Gold Swipe Card. Lastly, the &quot;cash-in&quot; action allows a player to discard two alike Swipe Cards (such as discarding two Black Swipe Cards) to receive one new card from the dealer. This action can only be done once per turn, so if you were hoping for a particular card, you will not be able to cash in another pair of Swipe Cards until the dealer makes its way around to you again.&#10;&#10;The round ends once the dealer has dealt the last card, and the player dealt the last card takes their final turn. All players discard any remaining face up cards. They then flip over all acquired face down cards and determine the winners of the 4 Master Points for the round in this order; Master Number, Master Color, Master Shape, Master Total.&#10;&#10;"

Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own.&#10;&#10;The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. &quot;Salem&quot; takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.&#10;&#10;Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.&#10;&#10;Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, &quot;Witch&quot; or &quot;Not a Witch.&quot;&#10;&#10;During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all &quot;Witch&quot; Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.&#10;&#10;Players can also use green and blue cards such as &quot;Alibi&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Matchmaker&quot;, &quot;Asylum&quot;, and &quot;Scapegoat&quot; to help or hurt their allies or enemies.&#10;&#10;As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, &quot;Night&quot;, forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate and the Constable chooses someone to potentially save. The other black card, &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise &quot;Conspiracy&quot; may soon have the whole town turned evil.&#10;&#10;Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of &quot;She's a WITCH!&quot; will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground.&#10;&#10;Volume 1 in the Dark Cities Series by Facade Games.&#10;&#10;"

When time is up, each player takes a turn reading their comic to the group (or, in the suggested 'professional mode,' the other players read the player's manga amongst themselves without the artist being allowed to give explanation). Based on the other players' judgement, each player earns 2 Fame Tokens for following each of the three core rules: (1) express your Themes (2) use 3 or fewer Word Balloons and (3) draw something recognizable in every Panel.&#10;&#10;Beginning with round 2, Trend Cards appear, putting more Fame in play. Trend cards (examples: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Shojo Manga, Sports, Destruction, Subtlety, etc.) provide new victory conditions in the form of instructions and a corresponding reward of Fame Tokens. Some Trend rewards can be claimed by every player simultaneously, others can only be claimed by one or two winners (such as &quot;Eager Audience,&quot; which rewards Fame to the first player to finish drawing before time runs out).&#10;&#10;In addition, each round after the 1st, the Comic Pages become denser, requiring the players to draw more Panels in the same amount of time. Round 1 is 2 Panels; round 2 is 4 Panels; round 3 is 6 Panels; round 4 is 8 Panels. The number of Trends also goes up from round to round. Round 2 has 1 Trend; round 3 has 2 Trends; round 4 has 4 Trends.&#10;&#10;When round 4 ends, the winner (the most successful comic artist) is the one with the most Fame.&#10;&#10;"

The hunter wants to see those cute dragons dead, but must get past the dragon keepers. The keepers belong to different tribes but together they have the common goal of protecting the dragons. The keepers use magic in their duels with the evil hunter.&#10;&#10;Dragon Keepers was designed by Vital Lacerda and his son, Alexandre. Says Vital, &quot;He is the one who knows a lot about dragons and I could have never been able to do this design without him.&quot; Dragon Keepers has two different games in the box:&#10;&#10;KEEPER GAME: 3&ndash;6 players | 10&ndash;15 minutes | ages 6+&#10;In this competitive mode, the hunter rolls dice to attack the dragons and the players choose which of the attacked dragons they want to defend. The game ends when one player manages to heroically defend three different dragons or if one dragon gets three hits. The winner is the player with more successful defenses.&#10;&#10;DRAGON GAME: 2&ndash;4 players | 20&ndash;40 minutes | ages 9+&#10;In this cooperative mode, the keepers work together to defend and train the dragons so that they attack the hunter. Players can take four different actions: Defend, Cure, Train and Attack. Those actions are limited and they need to cooperate and organized as a group to manage to stop the hunter's attacks during the game. The players lose if a dragon is killed by the hunter, or if the battle event deck runs out. The players win if X dragons (where X is determined by the difficulty level) manage to successfully attack the hunter.&#10;&#10;"
