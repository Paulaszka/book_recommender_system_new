Each creature has a Power Level, represented by a single number. These numbers are added together to form a player's Total Power Level when battling. As the game progresses, so does each player's army and Total Power Level.&#10;&#10;To draft (referred to as &quot;Create&quot; in game), players discard combinations of Prime cards from their hands into the Prime card discard pile. Each Creature or Bonus card features a Creation Cost, specifying the combination of Prime cards necessary to create it. The Creation Cost may feature any combination of the following Prime card types: Bug, Sea, Bird, Reptile, Mammal, and Amphibian. Creatures themselves have types that directly correspond to their Creation Cost.  Players are encouraged to collect creatures that share types to increase synergy and for better chances at acquiring Bonus cards.&#10;&#10;After each player takes a turn Creating, the round concludes with a mandatory, free-for-all style battle. Each player's Power Level is compared and those with the highest or tied for highest Power Level win the battle, while each other player loses a Life.&#10;&#10;Players draft in between each battle and the game continues until only one player remains with any Life. The amount of Life chosen before the game will determine how long a game lasts. It is recommended to start players at 7 (short game), 11 (medium-length game), or 13 Life (long game).&#10;&#10;This strategic, card-based brawler features a modular design.  The core set, Genesis, functions as a standalone game.  Players may purchase expansions and shuffle them directly into the core set to change the game entirely. Groups may decide on which expansions to include and which to omit for a customizable gaming experience. Prime Ordeal is traditionally played as a free-for-all; however, its design accommodates team play as well.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

In the planning phase players roll and re-roll 4 dice in real time, aiming to roll a combination of dice that match an ability they wish to trigger in the upcoming, fight phase. Assigning dice to an ability allows players to fill their hand back to 4 dice from a large, common pool and repeat the process as quickly as they can manage.&#10;&#10;Once the dice pool is depleted, the fighting proper begins. Here players take a set of dice assigned to an ability and execute that ability, moving their piece through rooms full of enemies, and crossing them out when they are hit with the multitude of available abilities. Finally, players heal and upgrade their characters, bring new abilities and items into play to help them on their road to vengeance.&#10;&#10;Vengeance: Roll and Fight comes in two boxes: Episode 1 and Episode 2. Both episodes are stand-alone games with the same rules, but with entirely different content: different heroes, dens, bosses, abilities and items.

On a turn, draw a card from the deck, then (if you don't have a sum of 10) discard a card in a row in front of you; alternatively, you can pick up the discarded card of the player before you, add two cards from your hand to this card, play it beside you as a special sequence (a &quot;get&quot;), then discard a card. The cards in that &quot;get&quot; cannot be altered for the remainder of this deal, but they still count as being in your hand toward the desired sum of 10.&#10;&#10;When someone does reach a sum of 10, whether by drawing a card or picking up a discarded card, the round ends, with players scoring points based on the combinations they've made and certain conditions in their hand. Having only one 7 in hand is worth 1 point, for example, as is having four red and four blue cards, whereas having all cards of one color or two triples are each worth 3 points. You also score points for being the one to end the round.&#10;&#10;Play enough rounds so that each player starts a hand twice, then whoever has the most points wins. Alternatively, if a player collects a &quot;God Ten&quot; &mdash; that is, all eight 2s or all eight 5s, each of which sums to 10 &mdash; they win the game instantly!&#10;&#10;"

These actions will vary slightly depending upon the last number &quot;called&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, players score points for their place in getting their first bingo; numbers circled; and tens-digits of numbers circled.  The player with the highest total score after two rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Nearly a quarter of the rules are devoted to the designer's love of the manga series, Urusei Yatsura; this is where the game gets its name.&#10;&#10;"
