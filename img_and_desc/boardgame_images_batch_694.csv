Play is begun with five stones in each hole.&#10;&#10;At his turn, a player picks up all the contents of one of his holes and then distributes, one by one, the stones into the following holes, the direction depending on the hole chosen. Moves from either of a player's two left-hand holes are made in clockwise direction, moves from either of the player's two right-hand holes are made in an anti-clockwise direction, and moves from the center hole may be made in either direction. The move is finished after a single lap.&#10;&#10;A singleton which is played into an empty hole of the opponent's side, that is either the last or the first hole of the opponent's row), may not be played back in the next move.&#10;&#10;If the last stone is dropped in one of the opponent's holes and makes a two or a four, these stones are captured. Should one or more of the opponent's holes immediately preceding this on the line of play, also have been increased to two or four stones these will likewise be captured.&#10;&#10;The captured stones are removed from the board and stored.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no legal move.

If you know a fan of the red and white jumper-wearing character, then they'll love the chance to show their stripes in this exciting fast and furious search and find game where they'll say goodbye to school holiday boredom and so long to rainy day blues. Great for girls and boys alike aged seven upwards (and fun-loving grown-ups too!), the Where's Wally? Board Game is a race against time where being eagle-eyed and speedy is a winning combination! Players must find the picture on the board which matches the picture on their card. It might sound simple but try doing that when the sections of the board have been rearranged and there's a constant tick telling you that time is running out. The aim of the game is to be the fastest player to find and cover Where's Wally? pictures on the board with a Wally token. The next player tries to do the same and so the game continues until the timer stops. A card with a number '2' on it means double the challenge - you have to match the picture on your card to the picture on the board twice before play moves on. And if you collect a card with an 'R' on it, the direction of play is reversed and the four sections of the Where's Wally? board must be rearranged too. Simply super stripy fun for Where's Wally? fans who like a challenge!&#10;&#10;"

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;"

It was re-created in 1960 by Saveliy Yakovlevich Pahayev, a professor of the Gorno-Altaisk Research Institute of History, Language and Literature. In 1974, some reasearchers of this institute &quot;improved&quot; the rules and, in the following year, the first tourna&shy;ment was held in the capital of the Altay Republic. The game soon became a popular mindsport in the Altay region and is also play in Khakassia, Tuva and Buryatia. There were over-the-board  tour&shy;na&shy;ments in Russia (Besh-Ozek (Altay), Chernogorsk (Khakassia), Elo (Altay), Gorno-Altaysk (Altay), Kosh-Agach (Altay), Kyzyl (Tuva), Onguday (Altay), Shebalino (Altay), Ulan-Ude (Bur&shy;yatia)), Ust-Kan (Altay), and Yabogan (Altay).&#10;&#10;In addition, there is another &quot;Shatra&quot;, which is a little bit more chess-like and, which is mostly played outside of Altay. It was invented by Vladimir Leonidovich Taushkanov in the 1970s who helped to finalize the Shatra rules in 1974, but went a step further. The older variant popular in the Altay region can be called &quot;Shatra I&quot; and the slightly newer variant, which is today almost exclusively played outside of the Altay region (mainly in the European part of Russia) &quot;Shatra II&quot;. There is also a four-sided variation of Shatra I that can be played by four players.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to mate the opponent's king (biy). Besides the king, Shatra I has 16 pieces, which move like Russian checkers men. In Shatra II there is a king (biy), a queen (bat&iuml;r), two rooks (tura), two bishops (jalk&iuml;n) and 11 pawns (&scaron;atra). Capturing is in both variants mandatory and by jumping similar to checkers. The board has a very unusual shape and was influenced by Chinese Chess (the autonomous Altay Republic borders to China). It has a battlefield, a ditch, a gate and a fortress.&#10;&#10;Shatra I can be played online at Abstract Games (a Russian site) and Shatra II at Chess Variants Game Courier. Recently a book was published about Shatra I. Draws are possible and might be substantial similar to checkers and chess, particularly in Shatra I, if the game is played by masters. However, in Shatra I tournaments at Abstract Games, which are played among weak amateurs from Russia, Belarus and Germany, only every 15th game ends in a draw.

They have to put their differences aside and use their instincts to find a way to, together, prevent their races from becoming extinct.

Used cards are discarded, so you will have to refill the slot, or your chance of a miss will be increased on your next attack.&#10;&#10;Each character has their own special ability that goes well with specific cards.&#10;&#10;You win the game when your opponent's life is reduced to zero.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;2&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#163;&#133;&#229;&#130;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;HP&#227;&#130;&#146;0&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Players take turns moving their pawns around a uniquely designed board, trapping and capturing other players' pawns until there is only one player left on the board, who wins the game.&#10;&#10;Pawns move like castles in chess: up, down, left or right, as far across the board as the player wants, and can also push and pull other pawns or jump over pawns.&#10;&#10;With three moves each turn and a new turn after every capture games move quickly and the winner is never clear until near the end.&#10;&#10;"
