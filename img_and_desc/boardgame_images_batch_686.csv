Your hand consists of nightmarish aspects and you goal is to trade these with your friends. If someone can get a collection of similar aspects then they can master that part of the nightmare and contribute to your eventual escape - however each card that you receive in trade can force you to undertake certain actions, restrict who you trade with or limit how you can communicate. To make matters worse something is chasing you through the nightmare and you have to trade its card every ten seconds or be devoured. It's coming. Run.&#10;&#10;During set-up players choose a collection of nightmare types based on the number of players. This choice allows a group to include or exclude certain mechanics - so whether your nightmare will be an all singing all dancing nightmare is down to the exuberance of the players rather than luck of the draw.&#10;&#10;Escape the Nightmare is a challenging experience, with the average group losing a fair few games before their first victory. However the play time is quick and resetting for another go takes seconds. There are six difficulty levels to make the game accessible for groups of any level of skill and selecting different types of nightmare allows players to set the tone of their game to suit their preferences.&#10;&#10;"

Unfortunately the Sectridians lose the ability to acquire the primordium for themselves, because the asteroids become infested with another hostile alien species, the monstrous Raptezoids and their horrific mother, the Hive Queen.&#10;&#10;Encounters with the Raptezoids prove deadly to the feeble Sectridians. Thus, they are forced to abandon their primordium rich asteroids and, consequently, begin to die off. In a final desperate act, the Sectridians send a distress signal throughout the galaxy, hoping another benevolent alien race might come to their rescue. When their demise seems all but certain, a few rag-tag human factions receive the Sectridian cry for help, and, greedily sensing an opportunity to cash in on their plight, agree, for a handsome fee, to mine the Primordium for the Sectridians, battling the Raptezoid scourge in the process. These human factions also learn that, by gathering and selling specimens of the Raptezoids to a few curious members of an enigmatic scientific community sprinkled among them, they can earn a small, yet not insignificant, additional profit.&#10;&#10;It is not long before the lust for wealth sends these mining factions into conflict with one another, as they each seek to claim more and more asteroids for themselves. Ordinary space miners, most often equipped with nothing more than their trusty pick-axes, have to quickly learn to become soldiers as they are sent headlong into bloody battle against the armies of other mining factions. These conflicts become known as the Primoridum Wars, and rage for several years before the Sectridians suddenly, and mysteriously, disappear.&#10;&#10;You will play the leader of one these human factions. You will expand your primordium mining operations throughout the asteroid field, wage war against your opponents, fight the terrible Raptezoids, and gather Raptezoid specimens. At the end of five rounds, the player with the most wealth wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Primordium Wars is a quasi 4x, tile placement, resource gathering, and worker displacement game where players place tiles representing various structures onto their asteroids in order to increase their primordium mining operations. It is also a game in which combat plays a significant, though secondary role, where players attack each other in order to claim more resource producing asteroids, or to disrupt their opponents' operations. The game takes place on a modular board where, in each round, players slowly shift the asteroids around on the game board, subtly, or often drastically, changing the strategic situation.&#10;&#10;In each round, players will first acquire, in a bidding phase, tiles that represent the items needed to expand their mining empires such as: Various asteroid modules to build on the asteroids (mining facilities, orbital turrets, pulse cannons, science laboratories, etc), various starship upgrades (warp drives, sniping lasers, stealth devices, etc), miner and mercenary reinforcements, build points for building new starships, and grav technology for tethering asteroids together into clusters (a core mechanism that greatly increases mining production, and expands the functionality of most modules built on the asteroids).&#10;Players will then deploy their newly acquired items onto their asteroids and starships, take turns moving their pieces deeper into the asteroid field in order to expand their mining empire, and battle other players, Raptezoids, and the dreaded Hive Queen.&#10;At the end of each round players will collect their income from their mining operations and Raptezoid specimens, and a new round will begin.&#10;&#10;"

Using a modified version of the Shields &amp; Swords medieval battle system, it recreates one of the most famous battles of the Middle Ages.&#10;&#10;Near a place called Agincourt, Henry V of England and the exhausted, disease-ridden remnants of his army took on a French force the size of which vastly outnumbered his own, and proceeded to wipe the floor with 'em. The French may have had the numbers, the knights, and the horses, but Hal had a strong defensive position and the all-important English longbow. The French sneered at the bowmen as only Frenchmen can, but like the man said, don't nock it until you've tried it.&#10;&#10;Chief among the game's features is a clever, speedy, and diceless alternative to opportunity/reaction fire concepts that reflects the difficulties inherent in moving under missile fire. This results in a very tough game for the French Player. The English Player is favored to recreate the historical result, but it's not a stroll in the park.&#10;&#10;Like other titles in the Shields &amp; Swords series, We Happy Few is an ideal introduction to wargaming, but with just enough grit to satisfy the seasoned counter-clipper.&#10;&#10;"

The game comes with a game board, stones, and acrylic tiles. Most of the tiles contain one of six images (e.g., turtle, leaf, lizard, dolphin) in one of six colors. There are also a few special wind tiles. The game is for 2-4 players, who will evenly split the tiles. You win by being the first player to play all of your tiles.&#10;&#10;The first player selects one tile from their rack and places it in the center square on the board. The next player, and then each in turn, can add one tile to the board, but that tile must be set adjacent to one or more existing tiles, and it must match each adjacent tile based on either color or shape. If you match more than one tile, or you place your tile on one of the sun squares on the board, you get stones that can be traded in for extra moves, allowing you to get rid of your tiles faster. You can also use the special wind tiles to move a tile already on the board over by one square.&#10;&#10;As you play Latice, you&rsquo;ll learn to plan your turns and extra moves ahead of time. You&rsquo;ll strategically use wind tiles to alter the layout of the board, and play both offensively and defensively based on your knowledge of the remaining tiles.
