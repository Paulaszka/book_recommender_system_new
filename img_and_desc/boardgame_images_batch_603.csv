Marionette Kingdom&#10;2.  Greedy Kingdoms&#10;3.  Love Letter&#10;4.  Love Letter to Lady Luck&#10;5.  Goita&#10;&#10;The first two games are new versions of the existing games by the same designer, Hayato Kisaragi, featuring new art and fixes to the games.  All the expansions and promo cards are included in this version.&#10;&#10;Love Letter is basically the same as the version the one designed by Seiji Kanai, but the Minister has now been replaced by the Countess from AEG's version.  There are three new alternative princesses, each with their own unique power, to create variation to the game.&#10;&#10;The 4th game, Love Letter to Lady Luck (LLLL) is the sequel to the widely acclaimed game, Love Letter.  As it shares the same background world setting, the art and layout is the same as &quot;Love Letter&quot;.  However, it plays differently from the original.&#10;&#10;Using the cards from Love Letter to Lady Luck, a 5th game, Otome Goita can be played.  Otome Goita is based off a traditional Japanese game from the Noto Peninsula, Goita.&#10;&#10;"

Your goal is to find the Knowledge to break the curse over Transylvania but beware, the Knowledge you seek may just turn you into one of the terrible Monsters you have come to destroy.&#10;&#10;Transylvania: Curses &amp; Traitors is a heavily themed adventure and exploration game utilizing a modular board, variable player powers, hand management, and dice rolling.&#10;&#10;Paths to victory include:  1. Solving the curse of Transylvania by finding the right combination of Knowledge cards and returning your pawn to the Church Tile.  2.  Becoming a Monster (vampire, werewolf, or zombie) by collecting Transformation cards and then killing half the other players.  3. Killing a Monster as an Adventurer.&#10;&#10;Game play:  The board consists of sixteen 6&quot; x 6&quot; tiles representing places in Transylvania such as the Church, Graveyard, and Castle.  Adventurers start on the Church Tile and explore uncovering new tiles.  Each tile contains token spaces which are opportunities to perform challenges of strength, mental acuity, and spiritual fortitude.  A successful challenge results in the reward of a Quest card.  The Quest deck contains the Knowledge cards needed to break the curse.  While exploring Adventurers will also encounter Events.  Failure of Events leads to injury and/or death while success leads to additional rewards.  If Adventurers collect Transformation cards plus a card that activates the Transformation card, they become a Vampire, Werewolf, or Zombie.  The goal of the game immediately changes from seeking Knowledge to eliminating the other players by attacking them.&#10;&#10;"

Each player takes control of one of the four animal factions: pigs, goats, cows, or chickens. Each faction has its own barn and special attributes that impact gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each faction has three Generals that move around the farm harvesting crops and marshaling troops. Initially, the Generals can harvest only the least valuable resource: grass. Players must spend their resources in order to marshal new troops, which unlock the ability to harvest better resources, e.g., a donkey allows its General to harvest corn. Players work their way toward harvesting the most scarce resources so they can marshal the most powerful troops. Each General can command only five Troops, so players often specialize the Generals based on their location, nearby threats, and distance from their barn.&#10;&#10;The farm is an 8x8 randomly tiled board containing crops, obstacles, and empty fields. When setting up the board, a small 4x4 grid is laid out randomly, and each player positions his barn anywhere along the perimeter of the grid. The rest of tiles are then randomly laid down to form the final 8x8 board. When choosing a starting location, players must consider the available resources, distance to neighbors, and the faction's special abilities.&#10;&#10;In addition to the common Troops, each faction may also marshal Special Forces. Each Special Force Troop gives the faction a distinct advantage: chickens gain a movement bonus, cows gain a defensive bonus, pigs gain a harvesting bonus, and goats gain an attacking bonus. Players also have three hidden Command Cards that they may play at any time to gain an advantage or get out of a tough situation. The Command Cards range in effects and are very valuable when used appropriately.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to destroy the other factions and take control of the farm. Players achieve this by forming a Super Army and triggering the end game. At any time a player may choose to form a Super Army if all of their General are in their barn. The Super Army combines all of the player&rsquo;s Troops together under a single General. This massive army gets an attack, defense, and movement bonus, but cannot harvest resources or marshal Troops. Forming a Super Army triggers the end game as the only effective strategy against a Super Army is to form one of your own. The Super Armies then drop the gloves and battle it out for all or nothing victory.&#10;&#10;"

The Council has adjourned from a meeting that has left the members&hellip;&hellip;at odds, to say the least. Having already been dispatched, you take the role of commander of a small strike force representing your race and its enthralling stake in an archaic space station orbiting Earth. Equipped with unique and outlandish weaponry, abilities of extraordinary and marvelous effect, and the luck of the die, you will battle other players and the perils on board the station in a race to complete your missions and grasp victory.&#10;&#10;Game-Play: In Xenofaction, you control one of the many playable alien races with 3 four man squads at your disposal. Each with unique weaponry, abilities and styles of play. The board is made  of a hex grid making movement very easy and fluid. Weapons ranging is also based on this hex grid, for example; if a weapon has a range of 4, you count 4 hexs in the direction you are shooting from the attacking unit to the defending unit. The flow of game play if fluent and smooth as each unit completes its actions before you move to the next. Players take turns moving their units aboard the station and taking actions when necessary or desired. What stands out about Xenofaction is in between each players turn, another player will get the chance to control the station units (generally NPC's in a computer game). So instead of a computer autonomously controlling the actions of these type of units, players will get the chance to act as a sort of pseudo A.I. Action cards are used to create unique events and spur of the moment tactics, as well as useful items and bonuses to units.&#10;&#10;Goal: The way to win in Xenofaction is to simply gain enough victory points. These points are gained by accomplishing numerous tasks. First there are universal missions you can try to complete that are active for every player. Each mission can only be completed by each player once, but another player completing a mission does not make it unavailable for others. Next is sometimes even more fun and necessary than the missions. Each unit you kill or destroy, except your own, gives you victory points, each being worth a designated amount. One thing to keep in mind, sometimes the station wins.&#10;&#10;"

The hand is played out, activating figures according to the color of the suit. Move, shoot, repeat. Movement and combat ranges are measured. Combat requires a clear line-of-sight and is decided by guessing the suit of the next card drawn.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to run the opposing bears out of town.&#10;&#10;"

All meeples start in the center hole in the game board. At all times each Player has only 1 meeple on the board. The meeples begin on the space of their color on the inner circle and try to get to the spaces of their color on the outher circle. If a meeple gets on an occupied space, the opponent gets thrown back into the center hole to start again. When a meeple gets on a space of its own color on the outher circle, it vanishes into the hole of the same color. If there are meeples on the two other spaces of this color, they get captured and are thrown into the hole too.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who has the most meeples in his compartment under the game board at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"

All players write down a definition for this word/image, then everyone votes on which definition they feel is the correct one. Vote correctly, and you score points; have others vote for your definition, and you'll score too.&#10;&#10;"

In this country, its unfortunate inhabitants need to spend days picking up and stamping forms for any activity they want to do in their lives. The players play the role of agents who try to help their clients to complete a series of simple tasks like buying a house, drive a car or work. But do not think it will be easy, because usually Burocrazy does not help its citizens: the offices only operate during certain hours, there are endless queues, and forms and signatures expire quickly, forcing you to restart the process the next day! Good luck and lots of patience will be needed to not go crazy in the process!&#10;&#10;Bureaucrazy is a worker placement game, with an approximate duration of 45 minutes. Holds 2 to 5 players. A match lasts 5 turns, in which players try to get the highest possible amount of money in order to be the winner at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"
