Witches, its last remaining practitioners, have always been outcasts and could help human society only in strict secrecy. The leader of their people, the Septima, has always been the wisest, most knowledgeable witch. Now, as her time is coming to an end, witches from all over the world gather at Noctenburg to leave their mark on the hostile town and prove to the Septima that they are her worthy successor.&#10;&#10;Septima is a competitive, highly interactive strategy game of witchcraft. As the leader of your coven, you must prove your worth in the town of Noctenburg to become the successor of Septima, the High Witch. Practice your craft and gain Wisdom by collecting herbs, brewing potions, healing the townsfolk, mastering charms and rescuing your fellow brothers and sisters from the trials. But beware: magic, even if used for good, invokes suspicion in the townsfolk...&#10;&#10;Simultaneous action selection with positive player interaction: Septima&rsquo;s central mechanism revolves around the simultaneous, secret selection of one of nine Action cards each turn: Move, Collect, Brew, Heal, Recruit, Plea, Chant, Rite and Remember. Each Action gets a powerful bonus if it is chosen by multiple players, but performing them together also raises suspicion in the townsfolk and attracts the attention of the Witch Hunters. Decisions of when to do a shared action (and who to do it with) adds a fresh, semi-cooperative touch to a competitive game, and lots of player interaction.&#10;&#10;Rescue witches to build your Coven: Heal, enthrall or convince the townsfolk and amass enough support to sway the periodic Witch Trials in your favor. If the hostile witnesses are outvoted, the convicted witch is absolved and joins the coven that rescued them. You start small but you can grow your coven to up to four witches this way, each with their own personality and special ability to help your cause. Reckless Witches caught by Witch Hunters are also put to trial, so with enough support from the townsfolk, even witches from other, less careful players&rsquo; coven can end up in yours.&#10;&#10;Accessible, intuitive and familiar: Septima is Mindclash Games&rsquo; most accessible title to date, with beautiful, hand-drawn art style by Vill&#197;&#145; Farkas and with the character art of Barbara Bern&aacute;t, wooden components and intuitive, theme-inspired mechanisms.

It can be used as a divination tool (do I win or does Fate win?) But it is also a competitive pastime towards oneself. In fact, it is possible to numerically evaluate the outcome of the single game and gradually try to obtain better and better results. In this way it is also possible to compete with the participation of more players in succession of time.&#10;     The two dice act alternately as dice and checkers. The white die W is favorable, the one that could win. The black die B is the unfavorable one, the one that could make you lose.&#10;     At the start of the game, B is placed in the gray box in the lower center. It doesn't matter what value is shown on the top face of him.&#10;     You roll W with your right hand and, starting from the square occupied by B, advance it to the right to the first square that shows the same image of the face that came out in the roll of the dice. Here the die W stops while B remains in his place.&#10;     Now take B and throw it with your left hand. The result of the shot causes B to move to the first square corresponding to the exit face, starting from the position of W but in the opposite direction, ie to the left. Now two clarifications are necessary. The first, completely connected to superstition, is linked to the traditional beneficial influence of the right hand (which must be used to roll the white dice) while the left has always been considered a bearer of misfortune. The second clarification is fundamental for the purposes of the game. When the rule says: &quot;Bring B into the first square on the left starting from the one occupied by W&quot; it means that a possible release of the colors magenta, yellow or blue in this first throw of B will make it move to the right with respect to its initial position but &quot; however &quot;to the left of the white die.&#10;     After placing B in the corresponding square, W is taken from the square in which it is and raised (with the right hand) and then moved to the right up to the first square equal to the exit face. Also in this case the reference to the starting point of the displacement of W is the square in which B stands.&#10;     And so on, toss after toss in a continuous back and forth that leads W to the right arm of the board and brings B back to the left. The game continues until one of the two dice cannot move because it is in such a position that there is no square in front of it with the symbol that came out in that roll. If it is W, it is placed on the top white square and the player has won.&#10;     If it is B, it is moved to the top black box and the player has lost. So it's fate that won the game!&#10;     You can only win with an odd number of rolls and lose with an even number. This distinction also has its own symbolic meaning ... And you can win with a few moves or after a tiring sequence of rolling the two dice. Likewise, if Fate is adverse, a few moves may be enough to reach the nefarious black box. If you manage to stall, you must never lose hope: the arrangement of the numbers on the board can often turn the tables in our favor.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

You're given a non-stop barrage of ingredients, which you use to make sandwiches... of variable quality.&#10;&#10;Starting with a hand of eight cards, each turn you choose three cards to discard as a &quot;sandwich.&quot; The only rule is that the three must be equally distant from each other (e.g., 2-3-4, or 3-6-9, or 5-5-5, etc.). You then draw a number of cards based on the &quot;quality&quot; of your sandwich: if it all cards discarded were of the same suit, you draw four; if all three were of the same color but two different suits, you draw three (that is, you get back the same amount you discarded); if the cards were of different colors, you only get back two.&#10;&#10;The game consists in decisions about when to play certain cards and when to hold on to them, having a good idea of what's left in the deck and what's not, and in keeping your hand size healthy enough to stay in business. If you would draw the last card, you win; if you cannot make a sandwich out of your ingredients, you lose.&#10;&#10;The game can be played entirely in-hand, holding the deck of cards with the ingredients on top and the discard pile face-up below.&#10;&#10;As part of the Isaludo collection, the rules can be found in this forum thread.&#10;&#10;"
