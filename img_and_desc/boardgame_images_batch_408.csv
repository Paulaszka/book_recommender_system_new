Many of the students are unfamiliar with fractions or have had little practice using them.&#10;&#10;Fractions are frequently used in the automotive trade. A mechanic must know which wrenches or bolts are larger than others and must be able to state which fraction is larger when making a comparison.&#10;&#10;There are at least four suits based on the denominator of the fractions. The common fractions used in the industry from 1/2 to 1/64 can be used to form suits. The purpose is to use all the available cards by arranging them into suits in descending or ascending order. The suits can be color coded. For every substitution in the sequence, extra points will be given (for instance, 1/8 - 2/8 (1/4 ) - 3/8 - 4/8 (1/2) or 8/16 or 16/32).&#10;&#10;If a player fails to use the lowest denominator, then a point will be subtracted. There will be enough cards in each suit to cover up to one inch. There will be extra cards that will be used to cover the points of intersection between suits; for instance, 1/4 - 1/2 -3/4, etc.&#10;&#10;These extra cards will allow all suits to be completed in more than one way.&#10;&#10;"

Karma is measured in karma points which are achieved from the karma value of cards in your playing area.  These cards are typically sin cards which players will play from their hand to their playing area which represents the player choosing not to succumb to the temptations of the 7 deadly sins.  Playing sin cards can help you invoke special abilities called divine favors.  During a round players will be trying to empty their hand because any cards left in your hand will likely cause you to receive negative karma points.  The game ends after a scoring round in which a player achieves 100 karma points or more.&#10;&#10;

(What treasures could a novice be searching for? Forbidden cookies? A soft mattress? Or narcotics? Or a book of witchcraft?)&#10;&#10;While sneaking through the abbey, the novices must remain watchful for the Abbess or Prioress, who are on patrol to ensure that pure novices remain that way. These characters are controlled by other players who want to nab the novices before they can make it back into bed.&#10;&#10;Players play either as a novice, or as the Abbess or Prioress. The novices move in secret and avoid being seen or heard by the Abbess or Prioress. The goal is to make it to the location on the board where the novice can get her &quot;secret wish&quot; and return to their room without being detected.  All of the novices move in secret by marking their movement and locations on hidden sheets. The Abbess and Prioress move on regulated paths around the board, but can diverge and chase down novices that they see or hear. The player or players who complete their secret wishes and return to their rooms win, or the Abbess and Prioress win if they catch a certain number of novices.&#10;&#10;"

Each player is dealt 10 cards, the remaining two is called Squint. Players then put a card face down on the table, which shows their bid.  They can choose cards representing they are able to win six tricks without trump, six tricks with the suit of that card as trump, no tricks at all without trump, or none of the above. The better bid wins, in case of a tie both players have to try to win the number of tricks they claimed. If everybody chooses none of the above, the suits of the bid cards determine the contract (even partnerships can be formed). Then one or more players, depending on the contract, may exchange cards with the squint, and then tricks are played. The score is given only to the player(s) with the highest bid, and depends on the contract and the number of tricks won.&#10;&#10;"
