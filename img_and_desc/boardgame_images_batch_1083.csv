The loss was never agreed to and remained a bone of contention between the two countries. As time went on, Azerbaijan became sovereign country and quickly built up its former Soviet army. Russia remains allied to both countries now but has a defense pact with Armenia. It also sells both countries its military weapons.&#10;&#10;While Azerbaijan built up its military forces that are superior to Arme-nia, Armenia did could not match them due to the fact Azerbaijan used revenue from oil. By 2020, it was time for Azerbaijan to reclaim the disputed loss area.&#10;&#10;In late September of 2020, Azer forces made a surprise attack across the Nagorno front positions and slowly made in roads. The opposing forces were fewer but it was the terrain that would determine success. But the war did bring into view future warfare using deadly armed drones that Azer forces bought from Turkey and Israel. Unable to shoot them down, Armenian tanks and radar were decimated within a week losing 173 T-72 tanks, 257 APC, 67 rocket launched artillery, 23 SAM, and 14 radar. It was a staggering blow and great military feat of future warfare tactics.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Armenia agreed to a ceasefire in mid-October. Azer forces took the time to redirect their offensive and unleash its 1st Corps along the Iranian border on the 18th. This was a brilliant move catching the Armenian forces off guard in the Fuzuli\Fizuli area. the Azer armor and mechanized formations raced deep into Nagorno territory coming with-in 20 km of the key town of Lachin in the mountains. If taken, Azer would cutoff the only supply road into Nagorno. As Azer forces cau-tiously approached, Armenian military units in Goris began to counter-attack halting further advance. Being that the two lane road was sur-rounded my 4000 ft. mountains, Azer forces pulled back on Oct. 24.&#10;&#10;Now, Azer forces switched to another attack from Fizuli towards Shusha and the Nagorno capital. This main attack was a slugfest due to the mountainous terrain. Armenian troops fought tooth and nail but by Nov.4, Azer forces were within 10 km of Stepanakert and nearly sur-rounded Shusha. If either fell, again, the main supply road would be cut. Bitter fighting and artillery fire continued until Nov. 9, when Shusha fell to Azer.&#10;&#10;It was now Armenia agreed to Russia's peace plan. Estimated losses were up to 8000 men, well over 300 tanks lost total and hundreds of artillery guns or rocket launchers.&#10;LESS&#10;&#10;"

He was going down the street alone, lurching to port and starboard and bumping into everything that got in his way. When he crossed paths with me, he took my arm tightly and showed me a worn and half-torn map, with drawings and nonsensical phrases that filled each sheet.&#10;&#10;Then, out of the blue, he burst out laughing, left me the map and said goodbye shouting into the wind: &quot;And that's how I ended up with a sardine on my head!&quot; Since then I have had time to look at that old nautical chart many times, and I have always been curious to know what they meant, and what meaning those phrases and drawings had and, of course, what relationship they had with a sardine on the head of a man.&#10;&#10;Maybe you are able to make sense of this story... Or not.&#10;&#10;In addition to this witty story, the game brings a series of images and texts that will make sense when you put your imagination to work. There is only one question: What is a man doing with a sardine on his head? but countless possible answers. From the cards and their combination, you will be able to create a new story every time. Perhaps it will be a long story; maybe small or even a single scene. But you will take the helm, in the way you want on each occasion.&#10;&#10;The proposal of this game arose as a search. The original idea was to make a book album as open as possible: that each person, when reading it, would create their own meanings, make their own plot. This is how this book-game was born that proposes you to establish the reading rules, play with visual and written language to shape the narrative, create connections that only you will know and enjoy a different way of reading.&#10;&#10;"

At the end of round, players will summ the strengths of their squads of warriors and player who creates strongest squad will receive victory point(s).

Multiple layers of strategies create a wealth of tactical possibilities.

It can be used with any scale figures (typically 15mm or 28mm).&#10;Each figure on the table represents one man, and the game is designed for battles of around 50 &ndash; 100 figures per side.&#10;&#10;Basic Concepts:&#10;This game is played on a hex grid. Each hex must be big enough to contain at least 8 singly based foot figures, or four mounted figures.&#10;It is designed to be played with singly based figures.&#10;The game is card driven, so each player has a hand of cards, and cards are played to activate groups of figures and for other events.&#10;There are no units in this game. Figures can move around freely, although they will benefit from the presence of Leaders. Figures are activated for movement, combat and shooting by hex (so some or all of the figures in a hex may move, shoot or fight when activated).&#10;Each army has a Warlord and some Leaders. All rules applying to Leaders also apply to Warlords.&#10;&#10;Game mechanisms:&#10;All dice used are normal 6 sided dice. When the rules refer to a particular number that must be rolled, that number or higher must be rolled for success.&#10;&#10;"

The cards not chosen make those regions more fertile, and thus more valuable. To create a huge forest, you want to grow trees, plant bushes, and place lakes, while using the power of nature to gain extra actions. Ideally you can concentrate your trees in the most fertile areas, but without them overshadowing one another as you also want them to collect as much light as possible.&#10;&#10;"

The picture on the back of the cards is of a wind surfer on Lake Okanagan, and the box features a cartoon of Ogopogo, the legendary creature inhabiting that lake.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two decks, each with 51 letter cards and 2 wild cards named for Ogopogo. There are rules for five games:&#10;&#10;1. A rummy-like game. &#10;Players are dealt 7 cards, and on your turn you may:&#10;- Play a word of 3+ letters from the hand, 4+ if you haven't played a word yet. &#10;- Take a letter out of any played word of 4+ letters, rearranging the remaining letters to make a word, and using the taken letter with letters in your hand to make a new word.&#10;- Replace Ogopogo with the letter it currently stands for and use it to make a new word from your hand.&#10;- Draw a card. You may use it to do any of the plays above. &#10;When one player uses up all cards in hand, the hand ends and each player gets one point per card in hand. After a certain number of hands, the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;2. A children's game reminiscent of Rack-o.&#10;Each player has 5 cards in hand, and on their turn draws from the draw or discard pile, and discards. The first player to have 5 consecutive letters in hand wins.&#10;&#10;3. A Gin Rummy-like game with growing hand size.&#10;Deal N cards to each player, who in their turn draws and discards, and lays down their entire hand to spell a word if they can, after which everyone else gets one more turn to try to do the same. Each player who lays down a word gets one point for the hand.  The number N of cards dealt (and hence the length of the target word) starts at 2, and increases one per hand until N=8.  The highest point total wins.&#10;&#10;4. Themed words.&#10;The dealer declares a theme -- e.g. animals, colors, girls' names, etc. -- and deals each player 7 cards. Players draw and discard as in game 3. The game ends when a player can lay down a word of any length that fits the theme declared by the dealer.&#10;&#10;5. Solitaire.&#10;Draw 5 cards, and try to make and lay down a word of 3 or more letters. Draw cards as needed. You win if you can use the entire deck making legal words.&#10;&#10;"

Following the usual protocols, the fungus was placed in quarantine, but its explosive growth when exposed to the warmth of the ship caused it to break out of its containment area, shattering the glass and releasing spores into the ventilation shafts.&#10;&#10;Now, the alien fungus, dubbed the &quot;Phage&quot; by the ship's scientists, is infecting the crew, turning them into lurching, zombie-like horrors that are taking over the ship! The central power grid has failed, and half the crew are either infected or still in cryosleep.&#10;&#10;As captain, it's your job to make the life-and-death decisions. You need to get as many crew members off the ship as possible, but you cannot allow the Phage to escape. You'll have to wake the remaining crew members from cryosleep, power up the lifeboat hangar, keep the oxygen flowing, and initiate the self-destruct sequence. Consult your science officers to gain insights into how the Phage works. Send your engineers to jury-rig mechanisms to keep the Phage at bay. Task your operations personnel with keeping the oxygen flowing and the power online. Order your security officers to cover the retreat of your crew. How many can you save from humanity's first encounter with the Phage?&#10;&#10;In this strategic solitaire game, you play cards that represent your crew members to different areas of the ship. The game also plays &quot;Phage&quot; cards representing the ever-advancing influence of the alien fungus to the same areas. Using a simple trick-taking mechanic, you quickly determine whether the humans successfully achieve their goals (such as powering up the Bio Lab or restoring the oxygen supply by repairing the oxygen scrubbers), or whether the Phage have killed off the humans attempting to do so.&#10;&#10;Each &quot;station&quot; on the ship provides different winning and losing effects, and managing these effects in the face of the onslaught of the Phage is the key to rescuing crew members from the ship. You win by activating the self-destruct sequence and destroying all of the Phage. You lose if the Phage escapes the ship. Your score at the end of the game is how many of your crew members escape.&#10;&#10;"

With each die, they may either place a new chip on that location in their home row, or move a stack from their home row if they already have a stack in that space. Movement is similar to games like Backgammon, Kalah (Mancala), Veritas, or Tak: a stack of chips is dropped one piece at a time, covering other stacks as it goes.&#10;&#10;When either player runs out of options, the other player gets just one more turn, and then the winner is the player who captures the most points in the center.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;"

The potential influx of fresh French troops to swell the ranks of General Washington&rsquo;s Army drove the British to rethink their colonial strategy. As a result the British moved their efforts from the middle colonies to the southern colonies where it was believed sentiment for the crown&rsquo;s cause ran strong. Having secured Savannah in 1779 the British turned their eyes on Charleston and South Carolina. When the British crossed the Savannah River South Carolina became the focal point of the revolution.&#10;&#10;The years, 1780-1781, in South Carolina saw some of the most intense fighting that occurred in the revolution as both Loyalists and Patriots both rose up in numbers to fight for or against the crown. The struggle for independence during those two years saw over 200+ actions, skirmishes, and battles fought in South Carolina resulting in the names of Marion, Morgan, and Tarleton and places such as Kings Mountain and Cowpens entering American lore.&#10;&#10;Crown and Crescent models the two years of intense, fierce fighting in South Carolina adopting and modifying the unique and innovative command and control mechanics created by the Ragnar Brothers for ANGOLA!  These mechanics keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution as you guide your forces towards independence or crushing the revolting colonists. The map is divided into seven districts, encompassing 6 to 7 key locations each, used to show control of the district. Control enough key locations and you&rsquo;ll then control the district and therefore advance on the victory point track towards winning the game.&#10;&#10;The counters represent military units and auxiliaries such as artillery, rifled and light troops, grenadiers, dragoons, and cavalry. A unique command and activation system has players planning in secret the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is a tense game, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.&#10;&#10;Crown and Crescent can be played with between two to four players (Continental and Whigs vs British and Tories).&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One 22&rdquo;x34&rdquo; full-color map&#10;        Two full sheets of counters (352 5/8&quot; counters)&#10;        One full color rule book&#10;        One deck of 55 cards&#10;        4 player aid cards&#10;        20 dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
