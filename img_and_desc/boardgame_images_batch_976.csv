It's nearly sold out at this point, but revived by Nat Levan in his line of Nanodaptions that capture the essence of the game in a smaller package. In Chill Pill, you will simultaneously choose actions to try to raise the infection level above 7 without raising the temperature too high.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Based on Fever Chill by Kenneth Thompson.&#10;&#10;Now you play the viruses competing to infect a body. Players simultaneously infect a part of the body to increase their infection level, but too many viruses in one place also raises the temperature. The doctors always target the virus with the highest temperature, so you can only win by infecting faster than the doctors can treat or outlasting your fellow viruses.&#10;&#10;This game is back to basics, with two board variations on one two-sided card and a rule card. Just add 2 tokens per player (and an optional die) to play anywhere from 2-4, 5, 6, or more.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the July 2017 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;"

It&rsquo;s time to collect gems, build castles and stock up enough food. The fire dragons are sleeping. The giants of winter, lurking. The fall is precious and is vital to plan your actions wisely.&#10;&#10;Dwar7s Fall is a game about collecting gems in order to trade it for food. In the meantime, you also will need to build your dwarf kingdom and slay some monsters. In this game you have multiple paths to winning by carefully choosing your actions.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to perform their actions. Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile, place one dwarf in a tile, or move one dwarf by one tile).&#10;&#10;Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool.&#10;&#10;When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not yet played that round make their last turn and then the game ends. The points are calculated and the winner is whoever has more points.&#10;&#10;&#10;Note:  This edition also contains the special class meeples from Dwar7s Fall: Royal Decrees; the Guardian, the Warrior, and the King.

But winning this clever two-person game requires both a keen memory and cunning strategy.&#10;&#10;There are 10 total player pieces: 3 orange, 3 green, and 4 two-color pieces.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Turn five of the pieces orange side up and five pieces green side up, which will ensure the right distribution of two-color pieces. Each player then chooses a color and takes their five pieces.&#10;&#10;Moves:&#10;Player 1 starts by selecting a piece to play, after looking underneath to check its color, and places the piece anywhere on the board. Player 2 can then decide to PLACE one of their pieces on the board, FLIP any pieces on the board over while keeping it in the same space, or MOVE any piece of their color to a different space (you cannot move a piece that is not your color, only flip it).&#10;&#10;Winning:&#10;The game continues while each player tries to wager between placing, flipping, or moving the pieces on the board to create a two-by-two square of their color.&#10;&#10;"

During the Evening, Chieftains can use Vikings in their camp to challenge holmgang (a duel) against Vikings from other camps. The aim of the game is to gain the most influence, which is acquired by having Vikings join your camp and by winning holmgangs (duels). The player with the most influence at the end of the game controls the Althingi and wins!&#10;&#10;The aesthetic of this game is gritty and raw, with striking original illustrations by Lada Shustova. Special attention was paid to historical details such as clothing, weapons, and bartering goods, so rest assured that there are no horned helmets in this game!
