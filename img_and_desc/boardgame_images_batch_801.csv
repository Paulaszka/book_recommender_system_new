Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&#10;&#10;Ingenious Extreme features the same gameplay as Ingenious, but with the domino-style tiles consisting of two conjoined octagons instead of two conjoined hexes. Since the pieces in Ingenious had six colors on them, 'Ingenious Extreme features eight colors, giving players more to juggle as they try to score well across the board while shutting out opponents.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two empty octagon spaces of the game board. For each octagon on this tile, they score one point in that color for each octagon of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each octagon in a straight line from it. (In all you must check for scoring in seven directions from each half of the tile; you never look back from one half of the tile through the other half.) If a player brings the score of a color to 13, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 13 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;"

The City works as an ecosystem and its citizens try to adapt and transform it to match their needs. Sometimes, such changes come as a by product of some direct actions, some other times it comes from direct developments that come through the administration or private investments.&#10;&#10;We assess that it&rsquo;s not possible to witness such changes and transformations as a neutral witness: everyone is biased by its own experiences and perspective. Due to that, we have developed the different factions as how they perceive themselves. That is, portraying each of them per their own self-defined virtues and what they consider works best for most of the citizens, when not for everyone. Of course, as after all this is a game, for the sake of game balance we have adjusted certain values and actions to provide a better playability.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 4 players (but rules are provided for 3 and 2 players) and the city map is divided in districts. Each district has an array of values that describe its economic and population statistics. These values are a common pool for all the players, this means that your actions deplete some values to increase others, but doing so you might enable a 2nd player to play its actions in that district.&#10;&#10;The game has no luck component whatsoever, players' actions have a basic effect no matter where they play them, and an additional effect if certain values are matched. Each faction consumes certain resources and generate others, and not a single faction is autonomous: each of them requires at least one resource they can not generate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

When you take a card, you hold it up next to your case card, then the other players tell you how many characteristics they have in common. You then place this card in front of you, rotating it so that the number on the outer edge of the card shows how many characteristics they share (0-3).&#10;&#10;When you guess, if you're correct, you discard the case card and place a new one in the stand; if you're wrong, you continue the game as normal next turn.

On a operational level, players must take into account different kind of terrain and infrastructure affecting battles, in addition to their fighting forces.&#10;&#10;All factions differ from one another. Factions also differ in every scenario or campaign, both by units available and the phase they come into play.

On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck. If they draw a Shelter card, then they have to play it immediately by placing it down. Shelters can also be built by combining resources. Beside playing shelters or building them, a player can use one action card which might involve attacking or stealing shelters, swapping one card for another, skipping the next player's turn, protecting your shelter, drawing two cards from the deck or even canceling the action of another player.&#10;&#10;Eventually, a player will draw the Llamaged&oacute;n card from the deck (which was randomly shuffled into the lower half of the deck) and this means everyone gets another two turns.
