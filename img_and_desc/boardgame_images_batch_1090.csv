While the families struggle to survive day-to-day, they must gather the courage and tools to defeat the undead fiend!&#10;&#10;Kringa is a cooperative horror worker-placement game with a strong push-your-luck component.&#10;&#10;Players start with a family of four workers - each with unique abilities. Assign workers to locations to collect resources. Use resources to craft helpful items, hire helpers and overcome dangers. As dusk descends, you can choose to risk danger and stay to gather more resources, or return home to feed and protect your family with blessings and hexes.&#10;&#10;As night falls, Grando stalks Kringa. If Grando stops at a location or home, unprotected workers will fall sick or even placed in the village's crypt. If the crypt fills up, the players lose.&#10;&#10;Players have a limited time to discover how to destroy Grando by fulfilling the secret holder's objectives. Once a secret is discovered, you will learn one of Grando's weaknesses. Ready the weapons and set up a trap to lure Grando in. If you manage to successfully spring the trap and defeat the evil Strigoi, you win! If you fail, you doom Kringa to a fate worse than death!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

There are four elements, and each element is represented by unique colored elemental ring.  There are four dragons, and each dragon is represented by one of the elements.  The game is over when the elements at sea are exhausted and your island creators are relying on you to provide protection and good fortune for the coming year.&#10;&#10;Your gameplay is influenced by your dragon's elemental alignment, and you will need to gather raw elemental rings from the sea purifying them at elemental shrines. Once the elemental rings have been purified, they are placed onto your island, protecting your creators and also scoring you points. May the best water dragon win.&#10;&#10;Tatsumi explores new type of resource drafting that revolves around each player's dragon and its positioning and movement around the board. The 3D board physically holds every gatherable resource in the game, eliminating round to round setup tasks and allowing you to strategically plan ahead.  Resources are needed to complete set collections and are then placed onto your island into your point scoring engine.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you may perform two actions, one of which is a flying action (you are a dragon).  The other action is a choice between gathering resources, scoring resources, or shedding a scale. Flying is single point-to-point movement, often setting up your position on the board for your next action. Gathering is taking two resources from the board as a result of your position and unique dragon.  Scoring is transferring gathered rings onto your island and scoring points based on each color ring that you transferred.  Shedding a scale provides a unique opportunity to interface with the game, often taken during an awkward board state or positioning, and it provides a short term or long term benefit provided.&#10;&#10;When you're done with the game, simply reload the 3d board with rings for storage and affix the lid to enable a quick set-up next time you play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You will need two six sided dice, a pencil, the rule book, contract and map.&#10;&#10;The world has changed&hellip;.&#10;&#10;These are dark times. The world is being battered by an alien threat. We did not know what to call it at first but now it is known as Pod Fall. A wave of unidentified objects, hundreds of thousands of pods, carried by a solar current, struck the planet atmosphere and rained down upon the lands. Where they came from nobody knows but it was soon clear that the pods carried aggressive alien creatures bent upon terraforming the world in their own image. To our horror the pods were too numerous to repel, the outer shells hard to crack and the aliens within monstrously difficult to fight. But they had one vulnerability. They take time to hatch and so traps can be set up around the pods and as they emerge, they are triggered, and the aliens would have an unexpected and often lethal welcome to our world.&#10;&#10;The fight back began. There were too many pods for the military to destroy by themselves though and the tide turned against us. So, the general public came forward and formed Pod Task Forces, small groups that went in and setup improvised traps around the pods the army did not have the resources to deal with. Even lone fighters embraced what was being called the Human Responsibility. Now the future has a chance as the tide has been slowed as fewer aliens can break free to seed the world in their terrible image. But it is on a knife edge as circumstances could easily turn in the enemy&rsquo;s favour. So, until enough of the newly emerged aliens have been exterminated, the Pod Task Forces must continue their work for the sake of humanity.&#10;&#10;Your Role&#10;&#10;You have gathered together some willing volunteers and formed a small Pod Task Force and will be taking available Pod Contracts. These are issued at the town hall by Sarge, the resident Warrant Officer. By setting up the Pod Contracts the government acknowledges that, as well as doing their duty, ordinary civilians should be rewarded for carrying out the trapping of pods and therefore the killing or injuring of aliens. If completed these contracts reward the player with Experience Points and Resources Coupons. The world has come out of a ravaging few months and resources are in short supply and the government needs to distribute these who they can trust to do the job properly.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We must be seen to be helping the cause and when the time comes, and the world is free of the vile alien grip, then those who have fought the invasion will be rewarded.&rdquo;&#10;Sarge reminds you of your responsibility.&#10;&#10;Aim&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to eradicate as many aliens as possible, through the use of traps, in your allocated Pod Contract location. Pods will attempt to hatch when they sense movement nearby so there is a small window in which to construct the trap and then see it triggered as the alien attempts to confront the intruder. In each session you have one Pod Contract and encounter one location but once cleared there are plenty more and your Pod Task Force can continue on their campaign of eradication. You can keep the same characters and try harder maps as they become more experienced.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
