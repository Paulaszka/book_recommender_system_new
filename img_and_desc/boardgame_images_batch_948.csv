The first player is followed by an opponent and so on.&#10;&#10;Players use marked coins as balls and small lengths of wood as clubs. The object is of course to get the ball into the next hole. However, hitting another player's ball (even your partner's) gets a player another turn, which is an important part of the game. Finishing a hole also gives a player another turn.&#10;&#10;A partnership wins when both players complete the last hole.&#10;&#10;"

And welcome to our brand new cooking show &mdash; Ninja Chef: The place where true masters of nunchucks and razor claws compete against the great and glorious Octo Zamzey for the title of &quot;The Best Rice &amp; Sushi Chef!&quot; The drama is hotter than wasabi, the plot rapid as a flying onigiri! Sounds intriguing, huh? Then let&rsquo;s roll it!&#10;&#10;In the family board game Ninja Chef players participate in a cooking show not as regular folks, but as animal ninjas! There's more: the animals in the game are not just random characters, but the very last of their species in Japan. At Cosmodrome Games, we appreciate the diversity and fragility of nature, so we decided to create a special board game that will help you not only enjoy your time with family and friends, but will also tell a story about unique and endangered species.&#10;&#10;How does it all start? The show host and main jury is the famously beloved Octo Zamzey. He&rsquo;s become extremely tired of untalented participants and decided to get the fastest, bravest, and most nimble creatures in the whole universe. You might think at first that it&rsquo;s all about ninja turtles, but nope, that&rsquo;s a completely different story. Octo Zamzey called for Japanese ninjas! Why them? It&rsquo;s simple: our heroes share not only the ninja&rsquo;s path but also a hobby&mdash;they love to cook!&#10;&#10;Octo Zamzey is super hot-tempured and an explosive slime ball at the same time (he&rsquo;s an octopus, duh!). It gets really spicy in the kitchen when he&rsquo;s angry. And, Octo is up to no good and has an axe to grind with the ninjas. His tentacles are always aiming to strike their heads and miso-souped their plans!&#10;&#10;Move around the kitchen and collect the essential ingredients you need to cook up a fantastic presentation. Roll out your creation to the jury so they can taste your masterpiece&mdash;and select the winner!&#10;&#10;In this game, you need to escape Zamzey&rsquo;s wrath while competing with the other players!  Move around the kitchen and collect the essential ingredients you need to cook up a fantastic presentation. Roll out your creation to the jury so they can taste your masterpiece&mdash;and select the winner! For greater variety, the game has several modes&mdash;just choose yours:&#10;&#10;     Yakitori duels: Play in teams of 1-3 people with friends and family.&#10;     Single Taiyaki: Solo mode to fight alone against Octo.&#10;     Together we are strong as sashimi: Fight together as a team against Octo Zamzey.&#10;&#10;&#10;In each mode, use the special abilities of each ninja and don&rsquo;t forget about basic skills like kicking ingredients above the tables. And be careful! The kitchen floor is full of obstacles that can influence the cooking process.&#10;&#10;Ninja Chef will surprise you with its unique mechanic of cooperative worker-movement that allows you to make splendid combos by interacting with the other players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The forts cannot touch at all, even at the corners.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of stating an outside square to start at and a direction to cross the grid in (this may be diagonal). Every space in this line is hit and the target player states how many of their forts were hit.&#10;&#10;When a player thinks they know the locations of the opposing forts they announce this as their turn: if they can correctly name the center squares of the forts they win, otherwise they lose.&#10;&#10;"

The game idea is based on the famous thought experiment formulated by the Austrian theoretical physicist Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger. The experiment describes a cat that turns out to be both alive and dead due to circumstances and formalism of quantum mechanics. This unusual state makes the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat widely popular in contemporary mainstream culture.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to save the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat from inhumane experiments. Notwithstanding the long and complicated story of the cat, the basic rules are simple enough to understand by every person, even if he or she is unfamiliar with the paradox of the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat. Nonetheless, science enthusiasts will definitely notice that the rules contain multiple allusions to the quantum mechanical world view.&#10;&#10;The game is represented as a labyrinth with the changing structure - the Schr&ouml;dinger's castle. The winner is the player who managed to find the Schrodinger's cat in the labyrinth and led it to his starting point. The distinctive feature of the game is that all players can build and change the structure of the labyrinth the way they want. Specially elaborated system of action cards used on each player's turn is also of interest. Despite the randomness factor during a turn, it allows players to develop a unique long-term strategy.&#10;&#10;The labyrinth consists of 19 wooden hexagonal elements - the halls of Schr&ouml;dinger's castle. The halls contain passageways connecting their different sides. At the beginning of the game, all halls are turned upside down and are not visible to players. During his turn, each player can move around the castle, gradually opening the halls and joining the passages as it suits him. However, as soon as a player leaves any hall, this hall is turned over, and the next player who comes to this hall will be able to open it in a convenient way.&#10;&#10;The turns are made by playing action cards (3 cards per turn). These cards allow you to move around the castle, prevent the empty halls from closing, rotate open halls and rearrange closed ones, open locked doors, and arrange baits for Schr&ouml;dinger's cat. At the end of the turn, the player collects up to 3 new cards. The game does not contain direct conflict between players, all interactions take place through the restructuring of a common labyrinth. Victory conditions depend on whether Schr&ouml;dinger's cat is alive or dead, this is also decided by the players during the game.&#10;&#10;The game has a colourful minimalistic design. The game board is made of embossed wooden elements. Game elements do not contain any text - all the necessary information is contained in the form of images. The combination of simple rules and richness of game situations resembles chess, however, unlike the latter, the game contains a significant role of chance in the gameplay.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Each of the colored boulders will have a value and you must use a combined strength greater than the value of the boulder to be able to move it.  Be careful where your opponent is, he can use one of his warriors to knock one of your warriors off the field.

I have been a big fan of Dungeon Core fiction for ages and thought that being able to physically build your own adventurer trap would be cool.&#10;&#10;Little Living Dungeon is a mint tin game so it is small and portable, you start with your core room, and a small amount of Mana to grow your dungeon by adding extra rooms, at the end each day a adventurer will enter your dungeon to try and get to the core, and you will hopefully fight them off, as you grow your dungeon the adventurers get stronger and more of them. All combat is dice roll based.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Cards are transferred from the stock to the waste pile one at a time as long as it does not begin a new sequence with the cards on the tableau.&#10;&#10;If there is no scoring being tracked, the game is won if all three peaks are cleared before or after the last card from the stock is discarded to the waste pile.
