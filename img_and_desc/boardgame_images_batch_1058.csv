Another player is the Hero, sent to defeat the medusa. The remaining players are statues, previous victims of the Medusa, who know her weakness. The statues must convey this weakness to the Hero, before Medusa identifies it first.&#10;&#10;The Statues know what the Medusa's vulnerability is, and they choose to freeze in poses in order to suggest what it is. The hero must try and work out what this is and declare it before the Medusa does. If so, the Hero and Statues win. But if the Medusa has also worked it out, the Hero and Statues lose.&#10;&#10;Medusa's weakness could be a variety of things, and a deck of cards suggests the types of things it could be.

You can buy properties or campaigns on each continent and negotiate mergers between players, but ... beware of spies!! Their goals are dark, and they will try to screw you up.&#10;The setup begins by randomly delivering a business card and a different famous character card to each player with their own missions in order to win in SPYBAM. Even so, there are players who will have to go on a different side: the spies. They go together and win together. There will be a spy leader who knows the rest of the spies and the latter do not know the rest of their guild, so the spy leader must try to organize them without being discovered.&#10;At the beginning of each round, an extraordinary event card will be raised that benefits or affects depending on how you have your properties located on the different continents. Be prepared as these events can change your plans.&#10;Then each player's turn begins. Each one has 3 steps to perform:&#10;1) Steal an Advantage or Disadvantage card depending on the die.&#10;2) Draw a Property, Campaign or Fusion / Absorption card, choosing whether to activate it (paying its price) or save it in your deck of cards.&#10;3) Negotiate one of the following 5 options: activate a card from your deck, auction a card from your deck, forcibly buy an active property (from another player) paying double its price, move your headquarters or buy an advantage card to the bank.&#10;At the end of the turn of all the players, each one must invest in security the amount he considers, putting the money he considers in the security envelope. After this, all the players close their eyes and it is the spies' turn: one by one they will attack whoever they consider, leaving a token in front of the player. At the end of this dynamic, each player will look at the number of spy tokens received. If the number of millions invested is less than or equal to the spy tokens received, he will lose an active property. After this, each player receives the income from his properties and other cards before starting the next event or round.&#10;The objective of each player is to complete the missions assigned to their character as soon as possible. But if you are a spy, your goal is to fulfil the common spy missions, leaving aside those of your character. Spies win as a group.&#10;At any time during the game, a player can accuse another of being a spy, if he succeeds, he eliminates the spy from the game, but if he fails, he must compensate that player with a payment of money. Although if the accusation is carried out with an &quot;absorption&quot; card in its possession, if the accusation is correct, it takes all the spy's (Active) cards to its inventory (Not activated) in addition to eliminating it, and if it fails there is no penalty.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;En SPYBAM, los distintos jugadores (CEOs) compiten entre ellos por alzarse con el control del mundo.

I am a single mother who values my connection with my daughters above all else.  We invented this game and we played it often because it always made us laugh and feel closer to one another.&#10;&#10;It is best for 3-8 players ages 10 and up, although it can be modified for younger players.  The premise is that a &ldquo;category card&rdquo; is pulled by a judge and the players have ten seconds to think of something that falls within that category that will *most appeal* to the judge.  At 10 seconds the judge counts down, &ldquo;3-2-1&rdquo; and the guessers shout out their guess. For example, the category is &ldquo;car.&rdquo;  The guessers might respond: &ldquo;a mercedes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the 1976 Rabbit that you got on your 16th birthday,&rdquo; &ldquo;a bike because cars are bad for the planet.&rdquo; Anything goes so long as it will appeal to the judge.&#10;&#10;This alone sponsors conversation.  Players like to explain their answer and the judge likes to explain why he or she picks the answer that most appeals to him or her.  The winning guesser gets the point and becomes the next judge.  In the case of a tie where more than one player asserts the same &ldquo;winning&rdquo; guess, &ldquo;break cards&rdquo; are pulled. The break cards contain descriptions such as &ldquo;biggest hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;youngest,&rdquo; &ldquo;shortest&rdquo;, &ldquo;most recently ate a piece of fruit,&rdquo; etc.  The player that best fits the description wins the tie break, gets a point and becomes the next judge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Kanji are often hard for experienced Japanese readers, and the game plays on that problem.&#10;&#10;Each Kanji in the game is some version of a word with '-meru'. So players only have to get to something-meru in order to identify the card in question. However, the kanji are so tricky, and the game gives no assistance to help the readers, so there is no expectation for anybody to read it correctly, not the reader nor the players. Everybody is just meant to make the best they can and hack through it without worrying too much about accuracy.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Despite societal backlash and anti-Chinese laws, they have turned a profit and their quality of life has recently improved.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of members in the family, spanning three generations, who face threats of Jiangshi (hopping vampires) at night and oppression by day.&#10;&#10;Players must balance the responsibility of running and maintaining their family business with protecting themselves and their community from the supernatural forces.&#10;&#10;A game session takes place over a number of days, alternating between day and night scenes where the roleplaying scenes take place. During the day characters complete assigned restaurant tasks in order to keep the family business running. And the Game Moderator will out a tableau of Restaurant cards that the family will need to complete before diners start to arrive. Their success is determined by using Resilience slots from their characters to complete the tasks.&#10;&#10;Once the tasks have been completed to the best of the family&rsquo;s abilities, the GM takes any Restaurant cards that were left undone and places them on the central Restaurant board, rotating them such that the consequences face the players and cover the restaurant&rsquo;s slots.&#10;&#10;Prior to starting the morning scenes, each character must see how they&rsquo;re feeling from the trials and tribulations of the previous day. Each player rolls 1D4 and receives that many Mung cards from the GM which represent the dreams and nightmares of the characters.&#10;&#10;Colored Mung cards are good dreams, black-and-white Mung cards are nightmares, and must be used to cover a trait on their Character sheet. Covered traits are unusable until the bad dream is removed via role-play. If a character is unable to remove the bad dream Mung cards that cover up all of the traits on their character sheet, then the character is turned into a Jiangshi, a vampire. The black-and-white Mung cards are flipped over to reveal new skills.&#10;&#10;To remove the Jiangshi from the restaurant the players have 10 seconds to write a short phrase or sentence on it that captures how the family of characters stays strong and together. If the group is able to complete the phrase in the 10 second period (GM keeps count) then the Jiangshi is immobilized and can be then healed through gameplay.&#10;&#10;The whole group of players (not including the Game Moderator) starts with a Family pool of six eight-sided dice (6D8) on the 1st day. As they progress through the days, player characters start feeling the stress the hauntings on the family, reducing their pool of dice available. These dice are used to overcome challenges, or to help council and care for the emotional health of the family, removing Mung cards from their character sheets.&#10;&#10;"
