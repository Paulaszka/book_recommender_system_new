It is played on a 22 by 23 square board on which are shown 6 home ports (one for each player), and a number of islands. Each player starts with one fast and one slow cargo ship, 5 food cards and one gold.&#10;Islands produce one or more of 6 different valued commodities and players increase their worth by transporting these to their home port. Movement is controlled by three spinners (wind, range, weather) where the weather result modifies that of the range. Ships move orthogonally but never directly into the wind or backwards and players may divide their &quot;range&quot; movement between two or more ships.&#10;With the commodities obtained by shipment to home port the players may buy more cargo ships or warships or Martello towers. The latter two may be used to attack other player's ships or in defence.&#10;The game ends when one player can no longer continue trading and at this point the value of each players ships, towers and commodities is added up and the player with the highest value wins.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;Board game of trade and warfare based on the days of sail&#10;The game objective is to accumulate as much wealth within a predetermined time, and to force other players out of the game.

The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.&#10;&#10;The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.&#10;&#10;Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one hex) or retreat (two hexes) after combat.  Units have one-hex thick zones of control; movement directly from one hex in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining hex of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one hex per turn movement), mountains (one hex per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten hex movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.&#10;&#10;Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2&#10;&#10;"

Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points.

After four months of siege, the knights, in a desperate fight over St. Elmo Fort and its natural harbor, inflicted heavy casualties (according to reports, 7,000 dead) on the Ottoman forces. Following the landing of 6,000 - 8,000 reinforcements from Sicily, the Knights again defeated the Ottomans, who embarked and left.&#10;&#10;"

Approximately 1400 tanks and assault guns met head to head near the town of Prochorovka, in a battle that became a desperate close range shoot-out which would decide the ultimate sucess or failure of Operation Zitadelle.&#10;&#10;The 2nd SS Panzer Korps began it's attack on July 3rd, and spent the next 8 days breaking through the dense Russian defensive positions. During the late afternoon and evening of the 11th, they broke through and replused a counterattack by the Russian 31st Tank Corps. Reorganizing during the night, the panzers struck northward before dawn on the 12th. As dawn broke, the lead German elements ran head-on into the lead elements of the Soviet 5th Gaurds Tank Army and the battle was on. It was to last all day, in confused and savage fighting at close ranges. In the end, the Russians were driven back from the town, but the Germans were unable to push them any further. Losses exceeded three hundred tanks on each side.&#10;&#10;&#10;This wargame was first published as one of the Task Force Games Pocket Games.  It was later released in a boxed version with the name on the cover shortened to Armor at Kursk.&#10;&#10;Units are German Battalions and Russian Regiments &amp; Brigades, though all are similar in size and manpower. Hexes are 400 meters across, turns represent one hour.&#10;&#10;"

The Pawns start at the bottom-most spaces on the board and try to move up to the large, central top-most space: THE PIEDESTAL. Meanwhile, the Knights guard the PIEDESTAL and try to remove the Pawns from the game before they can reach the PIEDESTAL.&#10;&#10;The Pawns win the game if five of them reach the PIEDESTAL, otherwise the Knights win.&#10;&#10;SETUP: The twelve Pawns are placed three to a corner on the three lowest level spaces in each corner. The eight Knights are placed next to the PIEDESTAL, on all eight of the second-highest spaces on the board.&#10;&#10;MOVE: A Pawn can move to a space on the next higher level directly beside it. Or it can move any number of spaces around the same level, unless blocked by another Pawn or Knight. The Knights can move the same way, with the additional advantage of moving either to a lower or higher level.&#10;&#10;CAPTURING: During his turn, if a player is able to capture an opponent's piece, he must do so instead of making an ordinary move. To make a capture, the player moves his piece onto his opponent's space, and removes the opponent's piece from the board. A Pawn is able to capture a knight only if the Knight is one level higher than the Pawn, and directly beside the Pawn. A Knight is able to capture a Pawn only if the two pieces are on the same level, and directly beside one another. A player can never make more than one capture in his turn.&#10;&#10;"

Originally released in limited quantities by Ragnar Brothers of the UK, Angola quickly became a rare and highly sought after game of almost cult status. Why? Angola features a number of innovative game systems that keep players guessing, create plenty of tension, and reward the right balance of boldness and caution. MMP is now updating this classic with the fabulous graphics of the IGS line of games and bringing it to a wider audiences.&#10;&#10;The map is divided into areas, and units represent military formations and also special weapons, such as artillery, rockets, tanks, and airplanes. A unique command and activation system has players committing in secret to the order in which they will activate a limited number of their units for the turn. The players then take turns activating their units in the determined order. The result is like a tense game of poker, with players trying to analyze the map and out guess their enemies.&#10;&#10;The game is finely balanced, and all players frequently feel as if they are simultaneously on the verge of victory or defeat thanks to an ingenious victory point system that rewards good play for both sides and allows players to absorb reversals and strike back with the right countermove.&#10;&#10;Angola contains:&#10;    2 decks of cards (110 total)&#10;    32 page full-color rulebook&#10;    2 player aid cards&#10;    22&quot; by 34&quot; inch map &#10;    3 countersheets &#10;    4 six-sided dice&#10;&#10;Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;&#10;"

You summon creatures with Obsidian tokens (mana) and send them off to attack your opponent. Your opponent can defend with their creatures and gratuitous dice rolling ensues.&#10;&#10;You must make your Strike Roll in order to hit. If you hit, you then roll for damage and apply it towards the enemy creature's Life Points. A pencil and paper is required since creatures have huge life totals, a Centaur Paladin has 53 life points for example. If the defending creatures survives, it can make a counter-attack by rolling even more dice. You continue until all attacking or defending creatures have been removed.&#10;&#10;You can also cast Spells and equip your minions with Weapon tokens. Most creatures have cool special abilities which gives you plenty of options for customizing your deck.&#10;&#10;"

The first Player places from two to six numbered tiles on the board in ascending or descending order.  Sound easy?  Certainly-except that the total of all the tiles must be divisible by three.
