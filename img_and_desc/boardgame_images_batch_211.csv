Each square on the board has one, two, or three dots.  Players have tokens that move around the letters of the alphabet that encircle the board.  These letters have a numerical value associated with each, with (like Scrabble) the less often used letters having a higher value.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players guess a letter in a single word, but are restricted to guessing the letter their token is on or one of the next seven letters.  The Leader moderates.  Players get points based on the value of the letter correctly guessed times the number of dots in the square it rests on.  Players may move their token ahead seven letters around the board instead of guessing, to get within range of a letter they want to guess.&#10;&#10;The Leader keeps score, and the leading scorer when all the words are guessed wins.&#10;&#10;"

The survivors have banded together for mutual protection, resources are scarce and every other group is either a threat or an obstacle.&#10;The background of the Babylon's Burning game is it's core - not a few paragraphs tagged on to the rules as an afterthought. You're introduced into the game with an extensive history of the Hit and an overview of the world of 2025 and drawn in further with the extensive fiction and the beautifully rendered and atmospheric original artwork that appears throughout.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are detailed but intuitive. This is a skirmish level game suitable for anything from a handful of troops to forty or so miniatures per side. Squads, solo elements (officers, snipers, medics and runners) and support weapons move according to a variable initiative system - there is no waiting around twiddling your thumbs while your opponent moves their entire force and the system is perfect for games with more than 2 players.&#10;&#10;While it uses a fictional setting, Babylon's Burning recognizes the realities of modern combat. In order to come out on top, players need to keep moving, pick their targets well, take advantage of suppression and, most of all, utilize the terrain of tomorrow's shattered cities. This is a game that rewards players who ask themselves &quot;what would I do?&quot; - pushing blindly forward in tight formations is a good way to get very dead, very quickly.&#10;Another advantage of the realistic setting is that there are no &quot;super units&quot; - in the confines of a dark alley, a nail-studded baseball bat is as deadly a weapon as any other...&#10;&#10;The game accommodates a wide selection of faction types - Enclaves, Street Gangs, Mercs, Scavs, Ghouls, Culties, Mobs and Syndicates - all of them complete with their own restrictions and advantages. These factions don't just look different; they play differently too. From well armed Enclave militia built around a crack corps of pre-Hit professionals to street kid gangs moving about the table with dizzying speed on skateboards and roller blades, Babylon's Burning allows the player to choose the faction that best reflects their style of play.&#10;&#10;FEATURES -&#10;&#10;100 pages - looks great in color or black and white&#10;Full-color counters and burst templates&#10;Quick reference sheet and record sheets&#10;Extensive scene-setting fiction by Jay Forster&#10;Beautiful artwork by Elena Vanin, Jim Campbell and Craig Humpston&#10;&#10;REVIEWS -&#10;&#10;&quot;The first thing to strike me was the very well produced and laid out format&hellip;the rules themselves are well thought out [with] plenty of examples interspersed in the text [and] are framed by an engrossing piece of fiction.&#10;&#10;The best point of the rules is simply the fact that they are generic in their outlook - they are intended for use with any figures on the market, so they are not bound to a specific company's miniatures. This is a bonus, because you can use any figures you want, unlike some systems that insist on the sole use of 'official' figures.&quot;&#10;(From the WARGAMES DIRECTORY review)&#10;&#10;&quot;The background material is very plausible and I think well researched as to the possibilities of this occurrence actually happening. I&rsquo;ll not go into details about the background but lets just say it is indeed refreshing from the old nuclear exchange routine and I do think quite believable.&#10;&#10;Gives a multitude of campaign and scenario options&hellip;the gaming possibilities are endless and I have admiration for these guys for the concept being a quite in depth look at what could happen in the near future, and I surmise a lot of thought and research must have gone into the whole planning of the background.&quot;&#10;(From the WARGAMES FORUM review)&#10;&#10;&quot;We've been playing it, and loving it. The game is complex, detailed and easy to learn.&quot;&#10;(From the APOCALYPSE FICTION review)&#10;&#10;&quot;Well produced and nicely laid out...the rules are supplied with a hefty set of appendices detailing the various forces that battle within the futuristic world of Babylon's Burning.

After the initial placement, each player then alternately operate one of the five mechanic valves at the bottom of the tower under each slot to make the beads drop one by one out the bottom of the tower.  After each bead drops out, each player count all the points they get for forming lines of 4 or 5 beads of the same color. The player with the higher points scores the difference in points on the scoreboard.  The first player to reach 8 points on the scoreboard wins.

The goal is to raid planets and moons for victims. Winner is the first player to a 1000 body count. The board is a variable lay out of planets and moons with chits on them representing populations to ravage. Players move their ships from location to location and trying to over power what they find. Players use cards to increase their crew &quot;packs&quot; and give them bonuses as well as cards that effect the 'verse and other players. Players can upgrade ships to carry bigger crews.&#10;&#10;

Then he has to repeat the decade and the text under the corresponding disk. Only if he succeeds, he may return one chip to the box and replace the disk on a new decade; in any case, the next player gets to roll the die. The 11 and 12 on the die have special functions:&#10;When rolling 11, the player may place one of his chips on a cardboard disk of his choice. The next player who rolls the corresponding number has to take this chip before trying to remember what is underneath.&#10;When rolling 12, the player asks the player with the most chips left to remember what is under a disk of his choice. If the other player succeeds, he may place one of his chips on the disk and replace the disk, otherwise, the first player has to solve the task. If he does not succeed either, the player with the most chips may give him one of his chips.&#10;Apart from the material described, Millennium contains a small almanac (30 pg.) with a short description of each decades event, person etc.&#10;&#10;"
