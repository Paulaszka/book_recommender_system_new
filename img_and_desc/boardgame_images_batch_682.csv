The ports are as diverse as they are numerous, from the Orient to Ponant, Lorient, a port of the Royal India Company, Nantes with its international trade, Saint Malo the port-town of buccaneers, Paimpol with its Terre-Neuve breed of life-saving dogs and last but not least that high-point of fishing and maritime history, Douarnenez.

There are 5 major ports: Douarnenez, Nantes, Saint-Malo, Lorient and Paimpol. Each player is native to one of the ports and their mission is to deliver all 4 commodities to the port that buys them. Each port accepts only one type of goods (for instance Nantes is the port for wine). But you cannot deliver to your own port, but to the free port of Paimpol instead (thus the Nantes player must take the wine to Paimpol). The movement of each ship is driven by the play of one card from your hand each round. There are 52 movement cards in four suits (sextant, telescope, knife and cosh) numbered 1 to 10 plus M, I, K (this is a customised poker-like deck). After playing a card you follow the instructions of how to move your ship. The goal is to deliver your cargo and bring your ship back to port. The winner is the team who docks all eight ships first.&#10;&#10;"

They keep one, placing face-down in front of them, and then pass two from their hand face-up to the player on their left. This is repeated, keeping one passing two, until they only have three cards left in their hand. During this last hand (you'll have three cards) you'll keep one and only pass one. Once finished players will keep both of these cards to finish their set of cards. All players reveal their hands and begin scoring. The highest scoring hand wins and receives bonus points. Play to a set score, usually 100 points.&#10;&#10;Piat Gin is the next game in the series of &quot;alien card games&quot;, Konog being the first. Games designed around the premise of a fictional alien race and how they might go about making a game that reflects their culture, biology, ideologies and other aspects of the species. These games are imported and introduced to those of us living in the Core Systems by the explorers and pioneers returning from the frontiers.&#10;&#10;The Camenni are a long-lived species, known for extreme patience and sudden bursts of well-coordinated action. Piat Gin is a simple past time, different from the more complex time-consuming games that the elders might take part in (games similar to Chess or Go in which single turns can take years or decades to accomplish). This is not a game that possesses lavish details or ornate components. Piat Gin is carried by Camenni adventurers due to its small size or used to teach children patience and to practice the observation of subtle interactions of others.&#10;&#10;The card faces and their features are intentionally kept simple, possessing no complex Camenni script, only differing amounts of circles, triangles, or rhombus (3 suits, numbered 1-6). This is so the game can be taught to most any species that might be encountered (please note that this deck is not resistant to mucus, salivation, persperation, or extremely high body temperatures like standard &quot;outrider&quot; decks). Camenni will drag a game of Piat Gin on for hours and even days when playing with each other. Of course, we don't have that luxury and play a round in a few minutes.&#10;&#10;"

Develop your culture to make it easier to spot enemy spies, improve science to get access to more elaborate cards, further your military to increase the number of spies at your disposal, or invest in economy to pay for bonus actions, known as Secret Directives.&#10;&#10;Aim: There are four different types of Intelligence cards which are used to make progress on  4 corresponding development tracks.

As players progress up the tracks, which each have 10 spaces, they also unlock various benefits:&#10;&#10;Economy: Increases income of coins. Coins are spent on bonus actions which happen at the end of a round.&#10;Military: Increases number of spies you have. More spies means more actions can be taken in each round.&#10;Science: Makes more cards available. There are three levels of cards, at the beginning of the game, players only have access to the most basic cards.&#10;Culture: Means capturing enemy spies is easier. At the end of a round, players who have developed culture can roll one to three dice to try to capture enemy spies.&#10;&#10;In addition to trying to progress on development tracks, players need to build a deck of cards made up of Intelligence cards and Action cards. Cards can be added to their deck through research actions, which allow players to take cards from a shared supply. Most of the time, cards that are played return to that players deck by reshuffling their discard pile. However, playing Intelligence cards into another player&rsquo;s country removes that card from their deck more permanently, and can also slow their opponents progress on the  development tracks.&#10;&#10;"

The Turks were concerned about this possibility and they endeavored to remain neutral during the war. Unlike the First World War, the Turks could not hope to hold Istanbul in the event of a war, and any incursion by one side (Axis or Allied) would certainly invite an incursion by the other. The Turks were most concerned about Soviets, but if Hitler had conceived a notion of invading Turkey, the Germans' most daunting challenge would be the Allied response, not necessarily the Turkish Army.
