Tactical Warfare in the Age of Napoleon.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook introduction:&#10;&#10;&quot;This system is designed to play out a regimental level battle using 25mm figures in about half an hour or so.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ideally, the game is controlled by someone acting as Game Control (or Umpire) who does not give the rules to the players. This adds some uncertainty play and discouraged player from &lsquo;rules optimising' rather than just getting on ad playing the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In order make it as clear as possible what is going on, the status of the units is shown by labels next to the unit, and players issue orders by using order flashcards. The system does not use dice in combat resolution, which is an approach that is a unusual in most wargaming circles and will come as a bit of shock to conventional gamers.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This does give a slight chess-like feel to the game, and it does mean that a game which follows the same course will always have the same result. Fortunately, no game survives first contact with the players, and the chances of two games being exactly alike is small.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Although the rules were tested using 25mm figures, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what size models you use, and it might look more realistic to put, say, 15mm or 1/300 scale figures on the same sized base.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

The map scale will vary by scenario.&#10;&#10;From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;&quot;These rules started out as a set of guidelines for the operational megagame Operation Market Garden. This game was run twice, once in 1988 and again in 1993. In the course of these outings, the rules altered and benefited from considerable feedback from participants. The game system I offer here is a distillation of that feedback from users, together with additional thoughts and research.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is intended as a generic map gaming system for WW2 operations in the Western Europe Theatre, that is, covering operations from Normandy to the Baltic. With some alteration they might be suitable for the campaigns in Italy, although the terrain and operational practices make that theatre sufficiently different to make a rethink of the rules a good idea. The rules are not suitable for the Eastern Front or the Far East. The underlying assumptions vary far too much.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Operation Market Garden was a large and complicated operational game. It involved forces down to battalion level and headquarters up to Corps. When running such a game there is a lot to bear in mind, and the game system has to be robust in order that things progress smoothly. Of course, these rules do not need to be used only in the context of a full sized 100 player megagame -&#10;there are plenty of smaller operations that they could as easily be used for in the context of a club game for half a dozen players.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In addition to the reasonably straightforward aspects of ground combat the rules consider the problems of air-ground operations (both close support and airborne operations) and logistics (hopefully not quite as boring as some folk make out!).&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Simple compounds are common compounds which are made up of relatively few atoms.
