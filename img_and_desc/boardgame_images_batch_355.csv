Roll and move and do whatever the spaces say to do.&#10;&#10;Pieces move around an outside blue track if their piece is male and the inside pink track if female.  This is purportedly so the men can protect the women.  Players move by rolling 2 dice, if on outside track, and 1 die if on inside track or &quot;Profession&quot; track.&#10;&#10;Men start with paychecks of $710 and Women with $300.  The first player to reach 10 status points and have $20,000 wins.  Of course, the odds are so stacked that the lesson here is that no matter what a woman does she cannot come out ahead.&#10;&#10;"

In doing so, the players can decide how much risk they take by choosing how detailed they get in their localization attempt.&#10;The systems works more or less like betting at roulette; the smaller the region you guessed, the higher the return. But if you make a mistake you get nothing at all!  &#10;Europa is to 'Deutschland' what 'Ausgerechnet, Uppsala!' was to 'Ausgerechnet, Buxtehude!'. It just takes the game to another geographical level. &#10;The only major difference is the catch-up mechanism: Instead of allowing trailing players to jump over occupied fields on the point track, the game reuses the 'barriers' from 'Globalissimo'. The leading player has to guess the country of a certain location in order to advance further on the point track. Trailing players can then proceed without such a trial. Additionally, the last player may make a bonus guess by correcting or detailing another player's guess for a bonus point.&#10;&#10;"

Instead of controlling one crew member in adventure style missions you&rsquo;ll be able to play Battlestations: Fleet Actions taking charge of multiple ships and crews. No referee is needed as players battle each other for mission objectives, all the while gaining prestige, leveling up their crews with new ship wide special abilities.&#10;&#10;Featured is a new sleek rule set that has all the familiar Battlestations feel, but built for quicker and faster resolution on a massive scale. The familiar power levels in the ships are there with a few minor tweaks. For starters, all ships have unlimited helm power allowing them to perform a number of actions a phase only limited by the number of pilots. As a drawback however, any ship that fails in a piloting maneuver loses the rest of it&rsquo;s actions! Make sure those pilots go last! If you have to turn the ship to fire weapons make sure you make your skill check! Guns and shields work a little differently. The size of your ship determines the power that both guns and shields can have combined. It&rsquo;s up to the player to decide how that power is split. So a size 9 ship has 9 points of power to split between guns and shields. Unlike Battlestations energy levels never drop and there&rsquo;s no more power generation before a round begins. This means there&rsquo;s only ever two times during the course of the game that you have to adjust power levels; if your engines go down or if you transfer power. No more power booking keeping between rounds.&#10;&#10;Another new game mechanic is automatic actions. By activating crew some actions happen automatically.&#10;&#10;"

All the cards are dealt out, and everyone looks at their top card.  The leading player picks one attribute and reads it out loud (&quot;Okapi, Max Speed 35 mph&quot;.)  Everyone lays their card down and the card with the highest value in that attribute takes the lot; they go to the bottom of the winner's pile and he leads to the next trick.  The &quot;Flax&quot; card wins any trick but only may be used once.  The ultimate winner is the one who gets all the cards.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, players may look at their whole hand.
