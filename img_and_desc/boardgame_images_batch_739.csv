It consists of a deck of 56 cards, divided into four colored suits with card values ascending from 1 mile to 14 miles.&#10;&#10;Each player takes a well-shuffled suit, and the first player then turns over the top card. If it is a 1 mile, he starts his &quot;Speed Pile&quot; and can turn over the next card. If not, he places the card in a &quot;Delay Pile&quot;, and the turn passes. No player may have more than three Delay Piles.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player then has the choice of turning over the top card in his deck or adding the top card from one of his Delay Piles to his Speed Pile. Each time a card is added to the Speed Pile, the player gets another play. When a deck runs out of cards, all cards in that player's Delay Piles are shuffled together and become the new draw deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to complete his Speed Pile in sequence from 1 to 14 wins the hand, and gets points equal to the number of cards left in the other players' hands or Delay Piles. First player to 50 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

It comes in a ziplock bag with a plasticized map of the United States, 4 crayons (red, yellow, green and blue), and a deck of 56 cards (50 state cards, a Washington D.C. card and five color-coded wild cards).&#10;&#10;Players are dealt hands of five, and start by choosing one of their cards as their home state. Each player colors that state with his crayon. Each turn thereafter, a player starts by filling his hand to 5 cards either by drawing from the remaining deck or by stealing blind from another player.&#10;&#10;To claim additional states, players must play cards for states that are adjacent to a state they already hold. In addition to playing from their hands, players may play the top card of the discard pile at any time. Players color in states as claimed, and only discard at the end of their turn if their hand still has five cards in it.&#10;&#10;The states are color-coded by region, and there is one wild card for each region, plus a yellow wild card good for anywhere in the country. These allow players to claim non-adjacent states within the corresponding regions. Once all states have been claimed, the player with the largest number of electoral votes wins, with number of states held is a tie-breaker.&#10;&#10;"

It is not a crayon game. It is a unique game about the early years of railroad building in the 19th century U.S., with six railroads along the Atlantic Coast poised to build their lines to the Midwest heartland. Its main feature is a more realistic stock market model than any other game. The stock market in No Caboose! includes the effects of supply and demand due to stock trading, it embodies the effects of the nation's changing economic climate. Watch stock prices soar during economic booms! Watch those stock prices plunge during economic Panics. Players can buy stock to pump the stock price, or sell stock to depress the price. Players may choose a strategy of holding a diversified portfolio with stock in many railroads, or put all their money into one or two railroads.&#10;&#10;Another difference in No Caboose! is that players are not railroad presidents and are not bogged down in the detail running a particular railroad. Instead, players are financiers who arrange the routes railroads build and arrange the merger of small local lines into the bigger railroads. That is, players are in the role of banker J.P. Morgan, not the role of president Jim Hill. Players can help any railroad build a new line, which earns the player stock and money for arranging the new route.&#10;&#10;A player's goal is simple. Being a financier, the only goal of a player is to be the richer than any rival financier at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There are important decisions for players to make every turn, and players must watch what their rivals are doing. There are subtle strategies in selecting routes to build, stocks to buy or sell, and opportunities can be seized or missed. No player is ever out of the game, and victory in most games is in doubt until the final tally.&#10;&#10;"

Players are the proud owners of a few small textile shops with the ambition to build more and larger shops, sell more goods, gain customers' trust and popularity, in order to become the most successful merchant in Grand Bazaar. Players gain success points by satisfying their customer needs that are influenced by market demands. In order to expand, players need to hire more employees, build new shops and auxiliary buildings, increase their supplies, and attract more customers.

Players send their managers and employees to external jobs (common for all players) in order to build new shops, order supplies, hire new employees etc.  Then they operate their shops in order to gain money for the next rounds and success points.&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most success points.

However, it turns out that we are not alone in the universe! Five rival alien races &ndash; the Cuthonians, Flesh Eaters, Cybers, and Mutants &ndash; are not too thrilled at the Federation's advancement into what they believe is their territory. Top that off with the lurking threat of a band of fearsome Mercenaries, a race to achieve the best technology, and the ever-shifting tides of diplomacy and war, and Space Infantry Federation is a game that &ndash; both literally and figuratively &ndash; takes place on a galactic scale.&#10;&#10;Many things can go wrong on this journey. If an alien race starship is in Sol by the end of one's turn, the Earth is conquered and the Federation has fallen and will be lost to their new overlords. If Federation Stability drops to zero, anarchy will reign supreme. If all of the aliens achieve technology beyond what the Federation could ever dream of.&#10;&#10;But even with all of these ways to fail, you are determined, and if you can lead the Federation to take over the exoplanets in the various enemy territories, we will have an established foothold in galactic affairs for millennia to come. However, to do this we must build starships and space stations, maneuver those starships to other worlds, research new technologies, spy on the advancements of our enemies, and keep up the morale on the homefront.  Meanwhile, you must work our ways through the political tides with the alien races which are always in constant flux; There are many ways to win or lose our Federation, good luck Commander.&#10;&#10;"

Scores for each hand are accumulated and the player with the highest grand total wins the game. Players can draw equal and it is possible for them to end a hand, or even a game, with a negative score.&#10;&#10;Having been dealt a hand of twelve cards, players, in turn, move their marker round the board, discarding cards, picking up cards, scoring points, deducting points from other players, and from themselves. The maximum number of points a player can score in any hand is &lsquo;50&rsquo; but they can score extra points if having &ldquo;declared&rdquo; (played all their numerical cards), they are left only with Kings, Queens, Jacks (Court Cards), provided these are ALL of the same suit.&#10;&#10;Players move their marker and score points according to the value of the cards which they play. For example; a &lsquo;1&rsquo; of any suit is worth one point and allows the player to move their marker forward one space; a &lsquo;2&rsquo;, two points and two spaces; a &lsquo;3&rsquo; three points and three spaces, and so on, up to &lsquo;10&rsquo;. Players must always play a card of the suit matching the suit on the space which their marker is in.&#10;&#10;Court Cards follow a different rule. Players move their marker forward for the number of spaces indicated by the value on the particular Court Card played but, they DO NOT score any points. Instead they DEDUCT from their score, points to the value of the Court Card played. Only when a player &ldquo;declares&rdquo; do Court Cards take on a positive value&hellip;.&#10;&#10;(The cards for this game are specialized: The &ldquo;Ace&rdquo; has been replaced with a &lsquo;1&rsquo;; the &ldquo;King&rdquo; has a caricature of Robert the Bruce; the &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; is Mary, Queen of Scots; the &quot;Jack&quot; is Bonnie Prince Charlie (Charles Edward Stewart), and the &ldquo;Jokers&rdquo; are Crowns.

The hidden face of each hexagon can show a truffle (white or black and of different sizes), a mouse, an event or a snake.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, players receive a number of kibbles as written on the initiative card.

But take care! The work of the truffle hunters is troubled by a wild boar that can scare the animals and eat their truffles!&#10;&#10;The game is played through 3 seasons. Every season has specific rules regarding protected mountains and legal truffles. Forest rangers monitor the player&rsquo;s behavior.

There are four color-coded routes, and each player flies one plane E-W and the other W-E along his route.&#10;&#10;Planes have a 50/50 chance of taking off or landing when they wish to do so, and if they fail, that player's turn passes. The altitude dial then determines how far into the sky spaces above the map that the plane moves, but this is for visual impact only. Planes must take off, move forward, and land at each city on their routes. Once a player has two planes en route, the Weather or Dispatcher spin can be used for either plane. Oddly, the four routes are not equal: two have 9 cities, one has 10, and the fourth (orange) has 12.&#10;&#10;The game is undated, but because it was manufactured by E.E. Fairchild in Rochester while being marketed under the All-Fair brand, it was certainly published in 1938 or later, and most likely, given the theme, just after WWII.&#10;&#10;"
