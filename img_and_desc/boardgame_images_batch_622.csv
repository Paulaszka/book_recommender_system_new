Their aim is to get their degree before everyone else does by passing 20 lessons first. They do this either by studying hard, or by visiting the other players in their classroom and harassing them.&#10;&#10;Players can pass up to 5 lessons in every turn. They get their grade by rolling a 10-sided die for every lesson and then modifying the die with cards thrown by themselves or other players.&#10;&#10;Cards can be adding or subtracting from a grade, and they can be special cards. But basically they describe student life as it is, or rather as we think it is. Players drink tons of coffee, they get shut in in bunkers to study focused, and they give exams using a Divine Pen. They also invade other players&rsquo; homes to sabotage their alarm clock, and they cause a Zombie Apocalypse inside other players&rsquo; classrooms. And they start crying in front of professors to get a passing grade, they cheat like there is no tomorrow, and they go to parties that cause year-long hangovers. Grad Wars is a game for the students who want to get their degree first no matter what the cost, or the means.&#10;&#10;&Sigma;&tau;&omicron; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;&#206;&#175;&delta;&iota; &alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#207;&#140;

And someone on this pirate ship has the map!  To win, find that map and hold on to it, surviving the round - or be the last pirate alive with the lowest ranking card.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;&bull; Each player is dealt two cards.&#10;&#10;&bull; Players can choose to use one or two cards against their opponents, discard and draw a new card, or bluff.&#10;&#10;&bull; A player can bluff as long as they have at least one card of the card type needed to perform an action in their &#10;hand.&#10;&#10;Example: Danielle has one &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; card and one &ldquo;Cannon&rdquo; card in her hand. She decides that she wants to use the &#10;special ability that requires two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards. This special requires that every player with a &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; &#10;card must place the grog card face up in front of them.  That card is out of play for the rest of the game.  Those players now may only have one card in their hand.&#10;&#10;&bull; If a player does not believe that another player has the cards to do the action they just performed, they may call &#10;the player&rsquo;s bluff.  If the first player was lying, they have to reveal the card that was the lie, and they discard their remaining card and draw a new one.&#10;&#10;Example: John doesn&rsquo;t believe Danielle has two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards. He calls her bluff. As Danielle did not have &#10;two &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; cards, she places the &ldquo;Cannon&rdquo; card in front of her, as it was the lie - and that card is now &#10;out of play. She then discards her &ldquo;Barrel o&rsquo; Grog&rdquo; and draws a new card.  She is now down to having only one card in her hand.&#10;&#10;&bull; When the deck runs out of cards, the discard pile may be shuffled back in to form the draw pile.&#10;&#10;&bull; When there are no more cards to be drawn and no discard pile, the players that are still alive reveal their hands and what is stored in their &ldquo;Smuggler's Chambers&rdquo;.
