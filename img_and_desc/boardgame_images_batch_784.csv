After he went to the oracle at Delphi and prayed to the god Apollo for guidance, Hercules was instructed to serve King Eurystheus and perform twelve difficult labours to atone for his actions. In this game, players will take on the roles of Hercules and his companions to complete these twelve labours (known as tasks). However, things are not as easy as they appear - mysterious perils await you, and some of you might betray Hercules!&#10;&#10;The Labours of Hercules is a cooperative game for 4-7 players. Each round, different tasks will appear on the table. To complete a task, Hercules needs to collaborate with his companions to gather the necessary items.&#10;&#10;As the game continues, new tasks will arise to challenge Hercules and his companions. If Hercules fails to complete the tasks, he will lose courage (represented by bravery tokens), which may lead some his companions to betray him and further increase his challenge. Hercules and his companions win if they complete all the tasks. But if Hercules loses all of his bravery tokens, Hercules and his companions lose and villains who betrayed him win!&#10;&#10;"

Players guess the type of tale that god would want to hear most and lay the cards before them. The god will read the tales and choose one they wish to hear told aloud. That mortal wins the favor of the god and gets to tell their tale. The player who impresses the gods the most wins! What's your tale?&#10;&#10;"
