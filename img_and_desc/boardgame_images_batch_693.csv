This means that the player who is after honey must roll the last roll to reach or skip their four hamster spaces. If the player aiming for the honey is sitting on number 17, to receive the honey pot, they must roll honey with the hamster die and 3 or more with the number die, in which case they may remove the colored picture from the board. Otherwise, the player whose picture is rolled may advance, regardless of the player.&#10;The player whose placement piece lands on a large picture that represents the needs and worries of a hoarder must accept the penalties indicated on the picture.

Nathaniel Banks led a small army up Louisiana's Red River. His objective, in conjunction with an overland campaign through Arkansas, was the Confederate Trans-Mississippi capital at Shreveport. Poor coordination of the two columns enabled the Confederates to concentrate their slender resources against each in turn. Banks was first, and in early April his spearhead was hit near the crossroads of Mansfield. Historically, the Union forces, strung out on the march, were routed piecemeal, but the battle could have gone the other way.&#10;&#10;Mansfield uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era. Combat is based on unit quality rather than raw numbers, and rewards use of historical tactics. All units are susceptible to rout when weakened, so players must maintain reserves. Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     Level: Brigade&#10;     Hex: 440 yards&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts with two randomly-drawn tiles in hand, with each double-sided tile depicting 1-3 types of landscape out of the four types present in the world.&#10;&#10;When play begins, each player simultaneously starts laying tiles into the frame; each tile must be adjacent to two sides to be placed, so initially tiles can be placed only in the corners of the frames, with players building inward from there. Players can place tiles anywhere that they can legally be placed (two sides are adjacent to the frame or previously placed tiles and all landscapes match across tile borders.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile, a player can place it in their personal discard area, which can hold at most ten tiles.

Each god is associated with a particular type of landscape, e.g., the merfolk god. Once a player has followers, they can place a prophet on a tile they just placed to claim that section of landscape. Players can place any number of prophets in a landscape as long as they're placing each prophet on a tile they just added to the world.&#10;&#10;At any point in the game, if a player thinks that a section of the board cannot be filled with a tile &mdash; e.g., a space that's surrounded by four types of landscapes &mdash; that player can place a round city marker in that space, and then claim that city with a prophet. If a matching tile is found later, a player can &quot;smash&quot; and collect that city, replacing it with the tile.&#10;&#10;Once the world is filled or players agree that no more tiles can be placed, the game ends. Each player scores five points for each city occupied or smashed. Each landscape with one or more prophets is worth a number of points to the player(s) with the most prophets in it equal to the number of tiles in that landscape minus the number of prophets in it. The landscape with the largest mass rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest masses rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses; similarly, the landscape that appears in the most distinct groups rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest groups again rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses.&#10;&#10;Whichever god has scored the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"

In the former case, players each start with eight chips (1-4 x2) in their color and in the latter case they have 18 chips (1-6 x3). The chips have the reverse color on the other side, and the digit on the opposite side is 7-x, with &quot;x&quot; being the number on the front side.&#10;&#10;The board starts with two red chips (1 &amp; 2) and two black chips (3 &amp; 4) in the central square. Red starts, then players alternate turns. On a turn, a player places a chip on the board as long as it sandwiches at least one of the opponent's chips and flips it; to flip a chip, the sum of the sandwiching chips must be higher than the sum of the chip(s) being sandwiched. One tricky aspect, though, is that the sums of the chips are taken mod 10, so if you sandwich one or more chips with a 5 and 6, then your total is actually 1 (1 = 11 mod 10), so you couldn't flip the sandwiched chips unless they summed to 10 (since 10 mod 10 = 0).&#10;&#10;If you can't flip a chip, you must pass. The game ends when the board is full or when both players have passed. Whoever has more chips of their color showing wins; if the players are tied, then they sum the digits showing on their chips and the high score wins.&#10;&#10;"

In an attempt to break through American defenses to reach Albany, New York, Burgoyne launched his army at the American defenses on Bemis Heights. An American screen dispatched by Benedict Arnold clashed with the British advance in deep woods, triggering an afternoon-long fight fed by reinforcements for both sides. The battle ended in stalemate, as good as a defeat for Burgoyne, but might have tipped in his favor.&#10;&#10;Saratoga uses the simplified QuickPlay version of the Musket &amp; Saber system of warfare during the muzzle-loading era.

Leaders enhance unit capabilities. Special rules cover the characteristics of eighteenth century warfare, especially the emergence of light infantry, and the differences between regulars and militia. Winning the battle depends on deployment, thoughtful maneuver to concentrate at the key points, the proper coordination of arms, careful use of leaders and special units, and an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each army.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     Level: Battalion/Brigade&#10;     Hex: 352 yards&#10;&#10;&#10;"

For example, a cat can be moved from the Neighborhood to the Yard for 1 Action, or from the Yard to the Porch or from the Porch to the Yard (and vice versa). Playing cards may allow a player to move multiple cats at once, to move cats multiple spaces, to steal cats from opponents, or to make opponents give up cats. A player may also choose to discard 1, 2, or 3 cards as an Action. Once both Actions have been taken, the player draws back up to a full hand, and play passes to the person to the left.

After your home is destroyed, fairies help you build a new house. But since they will live there too, they walk around the new rooms having a good look.&#10;&#10;Players take turns collecting room tiles and spells from the board and then follow a solitaire process of building and scoring. The tiles show four portals, but 0-4 exit arrows which allow the fairies to walk only one way. Players can only build off arrows, so building is always with a mind to the next walk to score points as well as keeping it legal.&#10;&#10;Fairies will not walk through unfinished rooms, and rooms don't become available until the build time is spent. All the tiles have a build cost, and players add to this cost how many steps to the nearest bedroom, and how many rooms built this turn to get the final cost. This is marked on the room with tokens.&#10;&#10;Then build time is taken off each room according to which season you chose on the board. If you picked Spring, you get only 1 new tile but take 3 off each build time; Summer and Autumn get you 2 tiles and 2 off build times; Winter gives you 3 tiles but only 1 off build times. This means a balance forms between your house expanding quickly, or the rooms opening quickly, but not both together. Get it wrong and you restrict the walk and the chance to score points.&#10;&#10;Add to this special effects in rooms to trigger bonus VPs, teleports, repainting and so on, Feng Shui to affect the fairies, spell cards to help you gain, extra steps for reaching bedrooms, and bonuses for seasons and colours, and there's a lot going on.&#10;&#10;Production quality is high, the artwork is very good and the theme and the mechanics all work together nicely.

187361,,Summary:&#10;&#10;Neo-Hunt is a board game about highly advanced cyber varans (large humanoid reptilians) in special testing zone or battleground. Their mission is simple: destroy as many trooper units or other varans as possible before being destroyed or until there are no more troopers left&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;Players select a &quot;varan&quot; token and a corresponding &quot;order&quot; card.  All the &quot;order&quot; cards for players are combined with one gray &quot;trooper&quot; order card; this deck is shuffled to determine phase order.  &quot;Trooper&quot; cards are randomly selected to make a trooper deck; 7-17 cards may be used (this will determine approximate game length).  &quot;Sector Tiles&quot; are then shuffled and randomly distributed into a circle form to create a random playing board.  Players then receive a random &quot;varan&quot; card and eleven &quot;action&quot; cards.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;&#10;Play continues until all &quot;troopers&quot; are destroyed.  If a player's &quot;varan&quot; is destroyed they can resume with new &quot;varan&quot; but will suffer a score penalty.  On each player's turn they utilize action cards and move their varan into a new sector or attack any other unit they see.  On the trooper turn standard rules apply to move or shoot; troopers will only shoot at visible varans.  The game supports a few special status conditions which may occur.&#10;&#10;User Comments:&#10;&#10;The game is print-and-play and published for free access via HTML.  Components and rules are downloadable in PDF format.  Color printing is recommended.&#10;&#10;

The flavor of the game is a mixture of James Bond and Looney Tunes villains, focusing on ridiculous scheming rather than sinister.&#10;&#10;Game-play is accomplished in turns, with each player possessing two actions. Players may build structures, hire minions, develop schemes and attack other players. Most cards synergize with others, granting bonuses for building intelligently and towards particular strategies.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be the first player to score twelve infamy. Infamy is generated by completing plots - which require resources - and assaults - which require greater attack than an opponent has defense.&#10;&#10;"
