The designer has added new pieces and scenarios to this edition of the game.&#10;&#10;This 2-player game recreates General Patton's attempt to seize the key city of Metz and to get across the Moselle River before the retreating Germans can form an effective defense.  The U.S. forces comprised of three divisions of the 20th Corps had just completed an epic pursuit across France after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead.  The exhausted Allied forces were at the end of their supply line and has barely enough resources left for one last push. If they had been able to get across the Moselle River, they would have compromised the entire German Westwall defenses. This would have enabled Patton to make an attempt at crossing the Rhine before the end of 1944 and might have ended the war months earlier.  The defending German forces, four divisions of the 82nd Corps of the German 1st Army, were a combination of hastily collected and organized units, including fresh units from the German interior and remnants of units that Patton had been pursuing across France. The battle, which began on 7 September 1944 and lasted for about a week, was a singular opportunity that could have gone either way.

His party ruled the city board and no one dared to speak out against the Mayor. But as with Hamlet, something is rotten in the Kingdom. A Danish newspaper blew the story wide open. It turned out that the Mayor, among other things, had made some creative investments and given his friends loads of city business. To top that off, his expense account carried not only trips to Championship Football games, but also wine for more than 10,000 a bottle &ndash; Cheers&hellip;&#10;&#10;Sales and PR&#10;PBX was released in the beginning of November 2002, and were sold out before New Year &ndash; that made PBX: The fastest selling board game in Denmark ever. 12,000 copies sold from the shops in only 6 weeks &ndash; without a dime spent on marketing. Yet PBX was able to create heavy and very positive media coverage: The media also focused on the fact that PBX was the first of it's kind. Some articles even had politicians (the main characters in PBX) playing the game and reviewing it. National TV News gave it full coverage as Christmas Gift of the Year, including a review done by two Mayors. The second largest daily newspaper had &quot;business&quot; Cavling Winning (same as Pulitzer) journalists reviewing the game (BT).&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;As a Mayor of a Danish town, you are obsessed about making your city the best city in the country. To fulfil all the dreams you have for the city, the Game starts out with you taking an illegal loan of 250 million from the Government. Now your job as a Mayor is to drive around the game board in your Mayoral car and try to spend the money as fast as possible. On your way you pick cards with instructions on how much to spend on, for instance, &quot;gifts &quot; to business relations in return for favours, dinners you have to give to keep your fellow politicians on board and travels you need to make in order to do proper &quot;research &quot;. You have to be careful, because the people you mingle with can easily forget their obligations to you, even though the gifts you spent on them were expensive. Your political opponents (though still full from the &quot;friendly &quot; dinner you hosted) will try and expose you, or the Government might even call you in for a little chat that would force you on a leave of absence, where you have no chance at all of blowing your 250 million. The instruction cards, mixed with questions on luxury lifestyle, all evolve around issues that actually did take place, though blown totally out of proportion and with a humorous distance, making this the first Board Game ever to truly be appointed: A Satire Board Game.&#10;&#10;"

In several places, the attackers suffered almost no casualties and, by the end of the day, recorded gains of three to four miles.

The Axis had besieged Tobruk and were holding the Halfaya Pass into Egypt.  The Allies launched a wide sweeping offensive through the open desert with the goal of relieving Tobruk.  This is a battle with no clearly defined front line.  Historically, British and Axis formations criss-crossed each other in bewildering patterns.&#10;&#10;Blocks in this game are mostly regiments and brigades and each turn represents two days time.

As historian W.G.F.

He only changed his mind when he heard an announcement of the offensive on a British radio broadcast out of Cairo!  It was this mindset that led to some of the unique circumstances of this battle.&#10;&#10;"
