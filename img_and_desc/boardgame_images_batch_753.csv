(&quot;Clear for Takeoff&quot;).&#10;&#10;Each player has a fleet of three airplanes: small, medium, and large. Eight weather cards are shuffled into a small deck, then players are dealt a hand of six cards from a deck that contains cards labeled A, B, C, D, Delay, and Lucky Captain. A runway with sections A, B and C lies in front of all players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either discards 1-3 cards or takes an action. An action can be either playing a Delay card on an opponent's plane (which moves that plane back one space on the runway unless the opponent discards a Lucky Captain card) or playing a set of 1-3 cards of the same letter to advance one of the player's planes. If you play a single A, for example, you can place your small plane on the A section of the runway; if you play three As, you can place your large plane on the A. If you play three Cs, you can advance your large plane from B to C.&#10;&#10;To take off, you must play 1-3 D cards (depending on the size of the plane), then reveal the top weather card, which might show that one size of plane can't take off. If this size matches the plane trying to go airborne, then you discard the cards to no effect; otherwise, the plane leaves the runway and heads into the sky (a.k.a. the game box). A Lucky Captain card can represent any letter card when played.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, refill your hand to six cards. The first player to get all three of their planes airborne wins!&#10;&#10;"

Players will then take their decks into the second phase, the dungeon phase, where they will work together to defeat monsters; however, only the player that deals the lethal blow will get the fame for it. There is a lot of interaction and engagement due to players fighting over learning the same spells as well as fighting over fame.&#10;&#10;"

The Game begins shortly after the Japanese surprise naval attack on the Russian warships docked in Port Arthur. The Russians are now building up their forces and gathering their fleets to kick the Japanese out of Manchuria and Korea. The Japanese must capture a number of key Russian controlled settlements before Russia is able to effectively mobilize an overwhelming force into the region or the United States President, Theodore Roosevelt, signs the Peace Treaty of Portsmouth.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of the Japanese Naval and Land Forces, you must gather your land and naval forces to capture a number of Key Russian Controlled Settlements before the Russian Baltic Fleet reaches Port Arthur or President Theodore Roosevelt signs the Portsmouth Peace Accord.

It allows 1 to 4 players to assume the roles of the Captain, the First Officer, the Navigator, and the Chief Engineer on board of a type VIIC U-boat. The game is driven by a companion app, allowing for an unprecedented level of realism, as well as a challenging enemy A.I. which will push your skills to the limit. The action unfolds both on the strategic and the tactical scale, always demanding teamwork, efficient crew management, and quick situation assessment.&#10;&#10;Each of the four roles entails unique responsibilities, encouraging the players to develop an efficient communication scheme and use genuine navy terminology. The Captain oversees the completion of mission objectives, supervises action point costs, and is responsible for the crew's morale. The First Officer operates the companion app, manages the flow of information, and takes care of the crew's health. The Navigator steers the submarine by setting its course and depth, but also updates all the essential information on the strategic, and the tactical map. Last, but not least, is the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the engines,  repairs, as well as other mechanical implements on board of the U-boat (such as the ballast tanks, weapon systems, etc.). At the same time, each of the four officers commands his own group of crew members by issuing orders within a worker placement system.&#10;&#10;The idea behind the companion app is to deliver a real-time, realistic gameplay experience. To that end, the app features the most essential instruments of the u-boat (such as the periscope, the hydrophone, and the Enigma, among others). Rest assured, however, that the vast majority of gameplay traditionally takes place on the game board, with the instruments revealing otherwise hidden information, and the app requiring only certain data (such as the U-boat's course, speed, etc.) in order to generate an adequate A.I. response of the enemy force. It is also responsible for all the ambient sound effects, thus immersing the players even deeper into the claustrophobic interiors of the type VII C. But fear not! With open &amp; play being a design priority, you will be launching torpedoes in no time, thanks to streamlined rules, video tutorials, and variable difficulty levels for each player.&#10;&#10;From quick skirmishes, through full combat missions, to an all-out campaign, UBOOT: TBG will let you conduct submarine operations in all major naval theatres of the 2nd World War. Success of these missions hinges on the completion of various tasks delegated to the crew by the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (German Navy HQ), which include patrol duty, ambushing convoys, laying mines in enemy waters, and many more! Each mission will require the players to adopt various strategies and different play styles in order to successfully complete it, and the companion app will generate a detailed report at the end of each game session (evaluating player efforts, and possibly awarding decorations, promotions, etc.). That is, if the U-boat makes it back home...&#10;&#10;The stage is set and the crew is awaiting your orders. Do you have what it takes to command the Kriegsmarine's finest? Hunt or be hunted, as you brave the stormy seas of the greatest conflict in history!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the creator&#10;&#10;"

The building&rsquo;s name was drawn from Yakov Pavlov, a sergeant who led the initial storm group assault that resulted in the capture of the building from the Germans.

In most worker placement games like Agricola, Stone Age that seems to be the case.&#10;&#10;This game plays like a typical worker placement game. At the first round each player has 2 workers and they take turn placing their workers one by one onto the basic tiles. The basic tiles consisted of quarry(get a card and take first player),mining(get a card), construction(build a building), Education(increase a worker). At the end of each round you'd have to pay your worker salaries. If you don't have enough money to pay for the workers this round, you'd have to sell some of your private properties and it'd become public to cover the cost.&#10;&#10;Here is the most interesting aspect about this game, unlike most other worker placement games, as long as you place workers in the farming/gathering tile the resource for feeding your people is unlimited, they can create enough food for themselves. In this game, the cash flow is limited even if you place the worker in the market tile you can only receive money up to the amount that is available in the pool. The only way to increase the money in the pool is when players cannot pay for their worker and sell their property to bring cash flow into the game, otherwise, there is no way to add more money. At the end of the game, the sum total of the selling prices of all the assets is the victory point.&#10;&#10;in this game, If you want to increase population, you can increase it as you like, but unlike other games, population will not score at all except for the effects of some buildings. On the contrary, if the workers cannot produce they will become a huge burden and consume the economy, making accumulation of wealth absolutely impossible.&#10;&#10;Essentially, this players have to learn to balance between development of population and the economy. Too few people can not maximize profits. However, if there are too many people they will eat up the profit. Initially, increased workers to increase productivity seems to be very attractive, but when the workers begin to be a burden in the latter half of the game. there is no way to reduce the workers. There is no family planning nor natural disasters, major famine, massacre and cultural revolution in this game. Once the population have increased and if the economic development does not catch up, you will quickly understand what it means to be debt.&#10;&#10;"

With timely moves, you can place your opponent in a state of DURESS!&#10;&#10;Duress is a two-player strategic board game.  It is intended for adults and children ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;Each player has 16 tiles with different letters (A through P).  These same tiles are arranged as Goal Pieces in the middle of the board.  The Goal Pieces are arranged symmetrically, equidistant from the two players.  Once a layout is selected, the Goal Pieces are arranged in a random order.  The two players may also decide to take turns selecting the placement of the individual tiles, which adds strategy to the game.&#10;&#10;There are also Movement Pieces corresponding to chess pieces.  In a classic game of Duress, there are 16 Movement Pieces: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, and 1 king.&#10;&#10;Once the Goal Pieces are arranged, the two players take turns.  In a single turn, the player:&#10;&#10;a) Selects a Movement Piece at random.&#10;&#10;b) Selects one of the tiles to move.&#10;&#10;c) Moves the selected tile to a new location based on the Movement Piece.  Other tiles can block the movements of the pieces, creating opportunities for strategic play.&#10;&#10;Players score points by landing their pieces on the corresponding Goal Pieces before the opponent can get there.  So, the two A tiles are racing to reach the A in the Goal Pieces.  The same goes for each letter.&#10;&#10;A player wins the game by scoring a majority of the points.&#10;&#10;There are many opportunities to change the structure of the game:&#10;&#10;a) Each game randomizes the order of the Goal Pieces, creating a different strategic challenge for the players.&#10;&#10;b) Players can take turns selecting the order of the Goal Pieces, creating additional strategy.  When one player goes first in the selection, and the other goes first in moving pieces, the potential for a first player's bias can be mitigated.&#10;&#10;c) The players may create alternative layouts for the board.&#10;&#10;d) As an alternative, players may select and hold 3 pieces.  This allows for planning moves in advance.  With each turn, the player will select one of the three movement pieces, move a tile, return this piece to the bag, and randomly select a new one.&#10;&#10;With many potential variations, no two games of Duress are exactly alike.&#10;&#10;"

There are countless combos, counterpicks and strategies to explore in the attempt to build a powerful and synergistic team.&#10;&#10;Each Hero is granted a Move and an Attack action per turn.

Matches begin by strategically positioning highly-detailed miniatures in an infinitely customizable battlefield featuring optional elements that change the dynamics of combat, such as walls, debris, altars and lava.

Players can make tournament tables and play simultaneous Matches on different boards; add or subtract different advanced rules and strategical features at will; try the game on custom boards or design their own missions.

The starting player will alternate in a clockwise fashion during each of the four rounds.&#10;&#10;Playing Cards:&#10;To play Heroes and Weapons, players must spend Gold equal to the Gold Cost in the upper left corner of the card. Spent Gold is returned to the common pool of available Gold.&#10;&#10;Heroes and Weapons remain in front of you when played.

Classes are indicated by card color and icon. Class is very important! Many powers on Heroes and Weapons can only be used if you control enough cards of the appropriate class.&#10;&#10;Monsters&#10;To defeat Monsters, players must have Attack equal to or greater than the Monster Attack Cost in the upper left corner of the card.

Oh, and also drinking and gambling.&#10;&#10;We present, for your entertainment, a new sort of party game for adults. Fair warning, though, it contains drinking, racing, expenditure of petty cash, and all manner of chicanery. Have you ever wondered if you were the fastest thigh-poker around? Are you confident that you could portray the most convincing withered crone? Do you excel at eloquence while inebriated? Want to win money from your friends? Do you enjoy judging the wit and skills of your peers? If you answered affirmatively to any of these, Hissy Fit is the game for you!&#10;&#10;Oh, and it also pays for itself the first time that you win, provided you play for real money. Now that's value!&#10;&#10;A game of Hissy Fit consists of players dividing into teams and competing against each other in bizarre and humorous challenges. These can be anything from &ldquo;First person to reach the Great Outdoors&rdquo; to &ldquo;Best Impromptu Facial Hair&rdquo; to the dreaded &ldquo;Slurgeon General&rdquo;, where a player will be forced to navigate a tricky tongue twister. After judgement is passed, losing players pay a dollar in tribute, and the winner flips their coin to determine how the drinks are administered. If they&rsquo;re lucky, all the losers will drink, but if fortune turns against them, they drink instead. After much competition, the besotted winner gets a huge pile of cash, and the losers go home happy.&#10;&#10;What's with the name? Well, in Hissy Fit, outbursts of laughter are both constant and contagious. Naturally,we decided to reward and punish it simultaneously. When the Hissy Fit token is invoked, all laughter is forbidden and only good-humored hissing is permitted. This effect persists only until someone screws up, but it is truly a sight to behold. As it happens, trying not to laugh is in fact more hilarious than just laughing, and the copious hissing adds tremendously to the fun.&#10;&#10;It's a game that pits subjectivity against objectivity in winners. Want to win a &quot;Best&quot; challenge? You'll have to convince the judge of your superiority. Want to win a &quot;First&quot; challenge?

It uses a combination of conflicting visual and verbal cues to disrupt automated processes used by brain the for language and color identification. While the neuroscience is complicated, the game is simple and easy to learn. The inclusion of profanity adds to the challenge while dozens of optional NSFW and drinking rules escalate things to another level. In short, when the eyes, brain and mouth don&rsquo;t agree, things get tricky.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;All players start with the same number of cards and are not allowed to look at their hand. Players take turns flipping over their top card and placing it face up in the middle of the table. Depending on the card flipped over, the player that flipped the card must either read the word on the card, identify the color of the card, or shout out a swear word. If they say the correct response, the card stays on the table and the next player takes their turn. If they hesitate or get it incorrect, any other player can call out their mistake. The player that messed up must then pick up all the cards from the table. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.&#10;&#10;"

Because all players are presented with a task card at the start of each round.
