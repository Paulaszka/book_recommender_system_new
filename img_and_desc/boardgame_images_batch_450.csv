Due to the discovery of Neptune, Uranus,  Pluto and the consolidation of the Sun centered planetary system, astrology had to change. New ruling planets were established for the Zodiac Signs, Houses were shifted and the characteristics of each sign changed in order to be aligned with the new form of our solar system.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards of Astrologica feature these changes, as each player makes the changes available through modern and traditional sign characteristics.&#10;&#10;In few words...&#10;&#10;Cards help you gain extra points, while creating row of cards &#10;with the Proper Signs and Elements might grant you victory at the endgame.&#10;&#10;As for the players, well, they try to put the Zodiacs in order along with the Elements.&#10;&#10;The stars were always there.

Hoarding: players were not required to make a play during their turn so it was possible to just collect dozens of cards then try to play them all at once. Although not a winning strategy it did kind of take the fun out of the game when someone did this.&#10;2. Two Players: The game was always best with four players. Although you could play with two people it wasn't much fun.&#10;3. Bluffing: It turns out that while some people loved the bluffing element, the majority did not care for that part.&#10;&#10;NOW BETTER THAN EVER!&#10;&#10;With the release of the Ten Year Anniversary Edition, all three of these issues are fixed. You can't hoard, playing with two players is definetly fun, and bluffing is now listed as an &quot;Advanced Play Option&quot; not part of the regular rules.
