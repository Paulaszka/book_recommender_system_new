It is a full box game.&#10;&#10;The Battle Manuver syster game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - often a different number for each player! - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions such as Counter-Attack, and Rally, among others. Players may play as many of their cards up to 5 when it&rsquo;s their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards&hellip; and the turn is over.&#10;&#10;Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes &ndash; with the use of some large counters. This is a game of position, feint, and sudden attack with what you hope are better odds (since you don&rsquo;t know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be). No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s.&#10;&#10;Playing time for each battle is about 2 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 8 pages! Balance is excellent, and because of the use of cards and their random distribution each turn, no game is the same as any other. And the game is playable solitaire (with specific rules for doing so).&#10;&#10;"

However, this time a new desire expressed by the huge Killer Bunnies fan-base has been fulfilled: Killer Bunnies now has a constructable game variation. Though still not collectible or random, players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey  six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.&#10;&#10;The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.&#10;&#10;Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is the latest in the family of Killer Bunnies games which features, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Remix, Kinder Bunnies: Their First Adventure and Killer Bunnies and the Journey to Jupiter.&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to individual starter decks (A-decks) and expansion decks (B-, C-, D- and E-decks), the following products are offered.
