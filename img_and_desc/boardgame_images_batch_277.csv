The aim is to play the tiles one by one and then trying to match the digit and the number of objects of the already played tiles on the table.&#10;The tiles are color coded to make it easier for the youngest children.&#10;&#10;"

Actually there are three different games in the box that are all playable with the same set of components. The games are of different difficulty levels and it's intended that as the child grows the game(s) can grow together with him. The goal of all the three games is to collect a specified set of 15 different animals.&#10;&#10;

It is very similar to his later Alien Space Battle Manual and Star Fleet Battle Manual, with good reason. Zocchi did not have a license to publish a Star Trek game when this came out, and in addition to the title the game uses images of ships from the series (the Enterprise is on the cover), not to mention the names and pictures of the characters. Paramount objected and Zocchi was forced to recall the game from stores. A few copies had already been sold, which are the ones occasionally seen today.&#10;&#10;The following year, Zocchi released Alien Space Battle Manual, with all the Star Trek references replaced with ones he invented. When he obtained a license from Franz Josef Designs (allowing him to use ship designs and names such as &quot;Klingon&quot;), he published Star Fleet Battle Manual.&#10;&#10;In this game, optional rules are given for the special abilities of some of the Enterprise crew - these of course do not appear in the later games.&#10;&#10;"

Players move along the gameboard according to a pair special dice, which, together, yield a random number from, zero to six. Along the way, each player must buy all six sections of an assigned possession as a victory condition.&#10;&#10;The gameboard is divided into six sections. No player may advance to the next section until all the players have completed the previous section:&#10;Paths of Fortune - Each player moves along a separate path using only one die.  Players may pay and collect money from each other. Each player has a guide card, which says what to pay or collect and from whom as one advances along the path.&#10;The Trading Area - Four trains, four planes, four ships and four buses are placed on random Purchase spaces in this area. Here players can buy transportation for use in the next section for price determined by a spinner or barter with other players.&#10;Transportation Department - If a player owns the method of transportation on the space landed there is no penalty. If the player does not own the method of the transportation landed on that player must pay all the players who possess that vehicle. The penalty escalates with the number of vehicles of the designated type owned.&#10;The Jamboree - Whenever two or more players land on the same space, all the players on that space spin the spinner and the player who gets the lowest number pays the penalty the space assigns.&#10;&lsquo;Round and &lsquo;Round Circle - If a player has yet to own all six parts on the assigned possession, the player must buy the remaining parts at double the price spun on the spinner. Advancing in this section means paying other players because of their occupation or because one lacks the transportation mode the space asks for. Players continue in this section until rolling doubles.&#10;The Pay Off - Players sell their possessions back to the bank for whatever space on which they land.&#10;&#10;When all the players have reached the end of The Pay Off section, each type of vehicle is sold back to the bank for values as determined by the spinner. Bank loans are paid back at 50% interest. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;"

The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.&#10;&#10;The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:&#10;&#10;-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.&#10;-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.&#10;-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.&#10;-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.&#10;&#10;"
