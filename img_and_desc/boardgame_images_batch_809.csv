Worried by recent events, enormous alien spaceships are sent towards earth. Announcing they come to save us from our self-inflicted fate, people rush to get on-board the spaceships. But the aliens will only let the smart people on-board, leaving the less gifted behind. Most of the leaders get in, but some didn&rsquo;t make the cut, for more or less obvious reasons.&#10;&#10;In World Dumbination you play as these five leaders that didn't make it on-board. You can choose to play as the leader of USA, Venezuela, Turkey, and Russia &ndash; or, of course, North Korea! It&rsquo;s never been easier to conquer the world. Will you make it to world domination, will you all destroy the planet in a nuclear super-shower, or will you collectively achieve world peace!&#10;&#10;World Dumbination is a fun asymmetric strategy game for 2 to 5 players. The game was inspired by world leaders arguing like small children sitting in a sandpit, and that is the idea for the cover art.&#10;&#10;Even if there are a lot of military leaders remaining, you need to build your military forces from scratch. Reaching your first goal makes you able to draw stronger cards. Each nation has two first goals option and the goals are different for each nation.&#10;&#10;Find the best strategy to move your forces and build military bases (that decide the strength of your units). The players choose and place cards to reveal them all at the same time. Play action cards to attack your opponents to gain victory points, or play project cards to get some advantages as well as victory points.&#10;&#10;You also have to constantly watch your ego and popularity levels that you can control with card actions. With too little self-esteem you don&rsquo;t dare to do any action. Too much ego makes you crazy and focused on only one target (you have to almost be crazy to use the nuclear bomb). If you get to unpopular, you as a leader can be overthrow by your own government. Getting very popular increases you income since your people work harder for you.&#10;&#10;There are geniuses (those who wouldn&rsquo;t get on the spaceships) still hiding on Earth. Finding one or two of them would also help you in your quest for world domination. You can also find things that the aliens left behind.&#10;&#10;In case the players get too clever, there are Dumbness cards in the mix to make sure some kind of stupidity will take place. Will anyone win the Nobel Peace Prize? Maybe some briefcases with secret codes got mix up during the last world meeting, or will the bombs fly uncontrollable around since none of the leaders have any knowledge of geography!&#10;&#10;You win by having the most victory points in the end. The game ends when a player has reached 15 victory points, or when 4 nuclear bombs has been disarmed and removed from the game. Yes, this is a war game you can win by making world peace! You will also find a party alien, fake news, reality shows, abandoned spaceships and cute kittens threatening to start a nuclear war in this game!&#10;&#10;There are some interesting new mechanics in the game, but the main thing in this game is the fun factor! This game is designed for a lot of interaction between players and the surprisingly events that shows up add a great deal to the silliness. And the more players, the more fun!&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts with a utility plant card, a house card, and a plain road card connecting the two. The utility plant and the house each have three utilities coming from them: gas, water, and electricity. The goal of the game is to be the first player to use utility tile cards (which each have segments of gas pipes, water lines, and electrical wires) to connect each of the utilities from the utility plant to the house.&#10;&#10;Each utility card has a unique combination of gas pipes, water lines, and electrical wires, so players must use spatial organization skills, puzzle solving ability, and strategic planning to ensure completion of their system before their opponent.&#10;&#10;The game is generally played with 2 players, but it can be played solo if desired. With two copies of the game, up to 4 players can play.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player begins with a utility plant card and a house card, connected by a plain road. The remaining cards are shuffled and placed face down in a stack.&#10; Objective: The goal of the game is to either be the first player to connect all three utilities (gas, water, and electricity) from their utility plant to their house OR to have fewer tiles placed than the opponent when the deck runs out of cards.&#10; Gameplay: Three cards are drawn off the top of the deck and placed face up in front of the deck. Players take turns choosing one of these cards and either adding it to their utilities OR replacing a previously-played card. When replacing cards, the card replaced becomes one of the three cards in front of the deck. When playing a new card, a card off the top of the deck is drawn to become one of the face-up cards in front of the deck. Cards may be placed adjacent to any card in play. Cards with roads can (but are not required to) be played on top of the starting road card.&#10;&#10;Connecting Utilities: Utilities do not have to align when placing a new card. In order to win, there must be a complete path from the utility plant to the house for all three utilities, and branches/alternative paths may remain unfinished. Water and gas align at the edges of the cards, and electricity aligns at the corners.&#10;&#10;Ending the game: The game ends when one player connects all three utilities from the utility plant to the house (that player is the winner) or when the last face-down card is drawn from the deck, in which case players count their utility cards and the player who has fewer cards in play wins.&#10;&#10;"

Howard (creator of Conan), Solomon Kane is a narrative adventure board game featuring exceptional 35mm miniatures. It is a highly innovative co-operative game of storytelling, resource management, and tactical miniatures play. Players take the part of the invisible powers of good and light who aid Solomon Kane in his quest to overcome the forces of Darkness. Each player is one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with special powers that reflect their unique role.&#10;&#10;Drawing upon Howard&rsquo;s famous tales of the Puritan avenger, the core box allows players to tell their own versions of the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, and Blue Flame of Vengeance. Expansions recreate Howard&rsquo;s other Solomon Kane stories, as well as adding original adventures for the hero, created especially for the game.&#10;&#10;In Solomon Kane, each of Howard&rsquo;s tales is told as one or more Acts, with each Act comprising a full game session. Shorter stories like Rattle of Bones can be completed in a single session, whilst longer tales will take multiple sessions to play through.&#10;&#10;An Act is broken down into 8-10 Chapters, and each Chapter has multiple possible outcomes depending upon the actions of the players. Some Chapters offer story choices, whereas others see the action play out on the game board as the players work together to aid Solomon Kane in his quest.&#10;&#10;Using custom card decks and dice, each Virtue can control Solomon Kane or his allies, moving them around the board, fighting enemies, exploring locations, and interrogating suspects for information. If the odds get too stacked against Solomon Kane, the Virtues can even manifest directly to intervene on the board.&#10;&#10;Opposing Solomon Kane and the players is the Darkness. This twisted reflection of the Virtues is controlled by an AI deck which determines the actions of enemy miniatures, thwarts the player&rsquo;s best plans, and competes with them to drive the story in an evil and unholy direction.&#10;&#10;The world of Solomon Kane is brought to life through the stunning artistic vision of Guillem H. Pongiluppi and game designer Jake Thornton, whose &lsquo;puppet master&rsquo; game mechanics break new ground in co-operative gameplay. With multiple versions of every single Chapter, Solomon Kane is able to combine immersive storytelling with abundant replayability for a truly unique gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;Who is Solomon Kane?&#10;Solomon Kane is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs. He roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest.&#10;&#10;All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa &ndash; even to the shores of the distant New World of America. He neither knows nor questions why is driven to do this. It simply must be done.&#10;&#10;To Solomon Kane he is the fulfiller of God&rsquo;s judgment; a vessel of wrath to be emptied onto the souls of the unrighteous. To his enemies he is an implacable fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon.&#10;&#10;"

You flip over and play these cards one at a time (no peeking at the other cards!) &mdash; Keep these &lsquo;faced-down&rsquo; cards  face-down until all cards in your hand and the cards facing up in front of you are gone.&#10;In a 2 player game if you flip over a REVERSE card, flip over and play another card&hellip; If the card you played after the REVERSE has a lower value the the card played previous to the REVERSE card&hellip; &ldquo;Tough Luck&rdquo;!  You get to pick up all of the cards in the &lsquo;played pile&rsquo;.  If you play a higher value car it is the other players turn.&#10;&#10;The first player puts a low-value card from their hand (or any card value they choose) on the table face up on the &lsquo;played pile&rsquo;. (2 is the lowest value and 12 is the highest value card.)The next player places a card down from their hand that has an equal or higher value than the card previously played on the played pile.&#10;&#10;If a player has more than one of the same card they can play as many of those same valued cards during his turn.&#10;Example: If a player has two &ldquo;5&rdquo; cards in his hand, they can play both of the cards if they want to at the same time.&#10;When 4 cards of the same value are played consecutively in turn those 4 cards and all cards in the played pile are no longer played in the game and go into the discard pile.&#10;If the next player cannot play an equal or higher valued card onto the played pile from their hand, that player picks up all of the played cards on the played pile and adds them to their hand.&#10;The player that picks up all of the cards from the played pile has &ldquo;Tough Luck&trade;&rdquo;! They must play the cards in their hand before they can go back and play from the cards in front of them.&#10;&#10;End of Game: The first player that runs of out cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;It is possible that your last card may be a RESTART &mdash; Play it and win the game, a RESET &mdash; Play it and win the game or a REVERSE &mdash; Play it and win the game!&#10;&#10;Special Play Cards:&#10;&#10;REVERSE:  The REVERSE cards reverses the play of the game (counter-clockwise to clockwise, etc).  If a player plays a REVERSE card the next player has to match or beat the card they just played.  If you play a REVERSE card your turn is finished. In a 2-Player game if you play a REVERSE card you get to go again.&#10;&#10;RESET: The RESET cards clears the pile of cards that everyone is playing on.  These cards are no longer used in the game and go into a discard pile.  If you play a RESET card your turn is finished.&#10;&#10;RESTART: The RESTART cards resets the deck to whatever value card the player chooses.  The player plays the RESTART card and then can play whatever card they want to from their hand.&#10;&#10;Game Play Variation:Try playing with less cards in front of you and more cards in your hand or vice-a-versa to add a different challenge!&#10;&#10;"

The death of King Enrique IV in 1474 created a domestic crisis in the Kingdom of Castile. The two contenders for the throne were Isabel, Enrique&rsquo;s half-sister, and Juana, the 13-year-old daughter of the late monarch. Both women counted with powerful allies in their fight for the throne: in 1469 Isabel&rsquo;s had wed Fernando, heir to the Crown of Aragon, and Juana married King Alfonso V of Portugal during the early stages of the war. In Isabel, the players assume the role of Isabel and Juana and their respective allies as they compete to garnish domestic and international support for their cause.

Isabel&nbsp;incorporates streamlined mechanics that are attentive to the historical circumstances of the conflict. Every turn, players face multiple strategic choices which, taken secretly, require tactical reconsideration made in reaction to the opponent&rsquo;s chosen actions.&nbsp;Isabel&nbsp;forces the players to constantly consider the risk-reward of their choices. With a limited amount of available resources, players have to decide when to sacrifice assets to obtain substantial one-time benefits.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The illicit relationship of the young lovers, Tristan and Isolde, threatens to start a war with their neighbours and then there&rsquo;s the rumours about Queen Guinevere and Lancelot...&#10;&#10;Players play as ambitious Lords in the time of King Arthur, all vying to be seen sat next to the most influential people in court at King Arthur&rsquo;s latest banquet at Camelot.&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves playing a Scheme card from you hand that will allow your character card to move in various ways, or allows you to move the other members (King's Knights, Guests or VIPs) of the banquet.  Moving one character, however, may cause the character it displaces to also need to move in a specific way, and moves may chain beyond your control! For example, moving a Knight may require that knight to automatically move straight to the Royal Row, which may then displace a VIP such as Isolde who must move to be next to Tristan, who may then displace another Knight, etc.&#10;&#10;You have until the end of the final banquet course (or &quot;round&quot;, which varies depending on chosen game length) to manoeuvre yourself into the best position to gain points from adjacent guests AND to hopefully complete your secret quest for bonus points.  The player with the most influence points wins (and becomes the most influential Lord of the land)!&#10;&#10;Each game also has a random or specifically chosen common quest that changes the rules of the game slightly, which all players are affected by.&#10;&#10;When playing with less than 4 players, AI players called &quot;Rogue Nobles&quot; operate the &quot;missing&quot; players, moving around automatically and likely screwing up your well laid plans!&#10;&#10;"
