Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable, but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles. The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the often chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level.&#10;&#10;Into the Woods: the Battle of Shiloh includes ten scenarios. They range from division level contests on half sized maps to two-map battles depicting both the first and second day of the struggle. Experienced players will be able to play many of the scenarios in one sitting. The game reflects the Confederate surprise, the &quot;greenness&quot; of many units on both sides, as well as the unique role Albert Sidney Johnston played in the Confederate attack.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Game Turn: 1 hour&#10;    Hex: 110 yards / 100 meters&#10;    Units: Battalion to Brigade (mostly Regiments)&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets&#10;    One 11 x 17&quot; double-sided full color map&#10;    Four &amp; half double-sided countersheets of 1,260 1/2&quot; counters (4 full sheet &amp; 1 half sheet - zero blank counters)&#10;    One 44-page GBACW Series Rule Booklet&#10;    One 56-page Shiloh Battle Book&#10;    Two 4 page Player Aid Card Folders&#10;    Two double-sided Battle Events Chart/Ammo Resupply Charts&#10;    Two double-sided Terrain Effects Charts/Disorder Tables&#10;    One double-sided Turn Track Cards&#10;    One double-sided Alert Schedule/Union Brigade Missions Card&#10;    Two double-sided Efficiency/Activation Charts&#10;    Two 10-sided dice (1 blue &amp; 1 gray)&#10;&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium-High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium-High&#10;Players: 1-4&#10;Playing Time: 3 to 8 hours&#10;&#10;SYSTEM DESIGNER Richard Berg &#10;GAME DESIGN Dick Whitaker &#10;DEVELOPER Bill Byrne &#10;RESEARCH Albert Smith &#10;MAP ART Charlie Kibler and Dick Whitaker&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;"

The advantages lay with the defender and that made the attacks costly and time consuming. Often both sides seemed to be in a quagmire that sapped morale and destroyed equipment and devoured manpower. In the end, the Allies prevailed, but their sacrifice, valor and victory were overshadowed by the D-Day landings and the campaigns in France and Germany.&#10;&#10;This game system is fast to learn, fun to play and reflective of the realities of warfare of the Second World War. The user will not have to invest in large armies or costly terrain pieces. With a little skill and some imagination players will be able to recreate and reenact some of the most difficult kinds of combat faced by American GI's, the Canadian Armed Services and the famous British Tommies. House to house fighting against one of the most cunning and deadly enemies of the Twentieth Century; The Nazis.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

In the first and second wars (1648-49), supporters of King Charles I clashed with the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649-51) pitted supporters of King Charles II against supporters of the Rump Parliament. It all ended with the execution of King Charles I, the exile of his son, King Charles II, and the shifting of the seat of government power. The outcomes of these battles are well documented, but what would be different had the troops of King Charles II prevailed at the Battle of Worcester or if Sir John Hotham failed to keep Charles I from entering Hull? &#10;Pike Hack: The Road to Dunbar may have some plausible answers.&#10;&#10;In this fun and fast-paced game, players use D-10 dice for casualty and morale calculations and D-6 dice for additional movement (evades and pursuits). The D-10 system for casualty and morale eliminates the endless modifiers that tend to make each move a monotonous chore. &#10;Basing figures, a common practice in many other popular game systems, is not essential to Pike Hack: The Road to Dunbar, since movement and engagements are based on numerical and figurative representations. For example, the system allows for infantry ranging from six to twelve figures and cavalry from four to ten figures; both are representations of much larger forces. &#10;Players are not, however, limited to small representations, as the game is designed to accommodate complete armies.&#10;&#10;An added wrinkle in this system is the use of directional dice for command control and first artillery fire. We found that the use of directional dice for these functions keeps the game streamlined, fast-paced, realistic and fun.&#10;&#10;The appendix contains tactical information, color illustrations to better explain tactics, and four pages of suggested army compositions. Because there are several different types of units, players are also provided with sample army lists and blank templates for composing custom lists.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;The second volume is District Commander Binh Dinh, set in the jungles of Vietnam circa 1969. This is a period of transition that sees Government forces shifting their focus from pitched battles to providing population security and pacification. Mr. Train gives each player very different tools - here, we have rules for Agent Orange, the Phoenix Program, and the Ho Chi Minh Trail, among others - with which to pursue a sometimes shifting set of operational goals in a highly-customizable sandbox.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Victory Points are earned through controlling provinces, represented by 64 beautiful Japanese castle miniatures.&#10;&#10;Once a province is conquered, proudly raise your Clan Flag over its castle as a symbol of dominance!&#10;&#10;In Daimyo&rsquo;s Alliance Phase, players form three sets of opposing alliances and then secretly bid Koku (money) on the alliance they wish to use for the turn.&#10;&#10;Alliances play a crucial role, as allied players cannot typically attack each other during the Battle Phase. This protection help to secure control over provinces and influence the course of the game.&#10;&#10;In Daimyo&rsquo;s Action Phase, players select and resolve actions, choosing from 16 straightforward options.&#10;&#10;These actions include;&#10;&#10;&bull;    Recruiting various soldier types, from elite Samurai Cavalry to deadly Matchlock Ashigaru.&#10;&bull;    Building Shrines to gain Honor or Fortresses for added protection.&#10;&bull;    Expanding economic strength or extorting peasants for immediate wealth.&#10;&bull;    Unlocking new tactics to sabotage rival clans&mdash;including allies.&#10;&#10;With limited opportunities to choose each action, players must plan carefully to outmanoeuvre their opponents.&#10;&#10;In the Battle Phase players attack or defend provinces using samurai armies formed from recruited units and vassal clans.&#10;&#10;The Battle Phase begins with players placing their War Leaders on the map to plot their intended attacks. Then, players take turns activating these War Leaders, launching their planned attacks or passing.&#10;&#10;Battling in Daimyo relies purely on strategy&mdash;there is no luck involved. Players must carefully allocate their units and vassal clans, ensuring their forces are strong enough to win without overextending. Allied players may tip the balance with their own forces, or be traitors and refuse to help!&#10;&#10;Players start battles with an army of face-down cards, which are revealed alongside any acts of intrigue or sabotage. Each army has a fixed strength, that is compared against the opposing force to determine the battle&rsquo;s outcome.&#10;&#10;Expensive units like Matchlock Ashigaru or Samurai Cavalry add more strength to their parent armies, but units like the Yari Ashigaru while weak, are cheap to recruit.&#10;&#10;An army marches on its stomach! Troops require Supply to sustain them and Ships to traverse Japan&rsquo;s seas. The more Supply and Ships a player controls, the further their armies can march!&#10;&#10;"

These 'Karma' cards allow players to impact their own 'Life Lines' and their opponents such as killing/reviving beings, forcing unexpected incarnations, and viewing 'Life Purposes' to better strategize.&#10;&#10;When a player incarnates the 'Human Form', gameplay comes to an end. From here players reveal their unique 'Life Purpose' cards and add up their scores. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The game system also gives a bit room to manoeuvre.&#10;&#10;Let us trust in the discipline and drill these soldiers were exposed to on a daily basis.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
