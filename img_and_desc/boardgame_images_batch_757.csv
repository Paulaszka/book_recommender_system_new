When a Block condition is met, that Block becomes closed and those songs are safe from the banes of Technical Difficulties, Broken Strings, and other immediate action cards in the deck.&#10;&#10;New to the game in 2nd edition are Block Modifiers, a type of card to add additional restrictions to a single block, granting bonus applause at the end of the game for achieving the listed goal or costing you the same amount upon failure.&#10;&#10;Once all their Set Blocks are closed, players then tally their Applause Points, accounting for a Song's individual worth, any special conditions granting bonus points, and a streak of consecutive Songs from the same record. Solitaire players aim to surpass a given Applause threshold for their chosen difficulty level, while 2 player mode has the players aiming to score higher than their opponent.&#10;&#10;"

On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point or remove a stone from an enemy weak pair. A weak pair is a pair of like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones with no like-colored stone orthogonally adjacent to both.&#10;&#10;You must not place a stone where your opponent just removed a stone from or remove a stone your opponent just placed. Also, you must not remove a stone if either player removed any stone on their single latest turn.

Starting as either a plant, mollusk, insect, or vertebral skeletal type, your flapping, paddling, and squawking carnivores and herbivores make a beachhead on one of the drifting continental plates in the Cambrian, Their struggle for terrestrial dominance may eventually include language-based consciousness. Although this achievement elevated a certain mammal species to notoriety, in your game things may occur differently.&#10;&#10;This second edition of Bios: Megafauna is an evolutionary descendant of American Megafauna but as a part of the Bios series of games it is linked to the game Bios: Genesis. It plays well independently but if you have both games you can let the end state of a game of Bios: Genesis affect the starting state of a game of Bios:Megafauna.  A successor game, called Bios:Origins (which would be a descendant of Origin), is planned to cover the events of the Quaternary period including the rise of ideas and technology.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The trivia questions, score, game instructions and game moderator are all contained in the &quot;Guess The Fake&quot; electronic unit that houses everything you need to play the game.&#10;&#10;Players will sit at one of the 5 colored stations on the unit and listen for instruction.  The electronic unit randomly picks a trivia question in true/false format and then directs the question to one of the colored stations, which will flash when selected.  The player then presses the button on their color station and then subsequently presses one of two buttons on the middle of the unit.  The green button signifies true, while the red button signifies false.  The player also has the option of challenging another player to answer the question.  Answering wrong equals a two point penalty for the challenged player, while answering correctly nets the player 1 point.&#10;&#10;The electronic unit also mixes in &quot;quick&quot; challenges randomly.  In this type of challenge, the electronic will ask a question than any player an answer, but only the player that pushes their color station button first gets to answer the question and score a point.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most points, and a typical game is the first player to 20 points.&#10;&#10;"

221802,,"Katra Mpantsaka (mpantsaka from tsaka &quot;limited&quot;) is a mancala game played by the Sakalava people, which occupy the Western edge of the Madagascar from Toliara in the south to Sambirano in the north.&#10;&#10;The game is typically played on a 4x8 board with 2 seeds in each hole, but it has also been described on 4x4 and 4x6 boards and with 3 seeds in each hole.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes and distributes them, one by one, either clockwise or counterclockwise into consecutive holes around the two rows of his own side. (For the remainder of the turn the direction of sowing may not be changed during a turn).&#10;&#10;If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap continuing in the same direction as before.&#10;&#10;The first lap must be started with an occupied hole of the inner row unless the inner row is empty. When the inner row is empty, a player may start from the back row.  Unlike many other manacala games a move may start with a singleton.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole (mandri &quot;to sleep&quot;).  However, if the last piece is placed in the inner row, then it captures the opponent's pieces on the inner row and the sowing continues play continues is if the last stone had landed in an non-empty row.&#10;&#10;The game ends, when a player has no seeds left.&#10;&#10;The player who captured all of the seeds, wins the game. The loser is said to be &quot;lazy (kamo).&#10;&#10;"

As a commander of a star fleet, it is your duty to position your forces at the right time at the right planet and claim it for your faction. Beware, the strongest faction will claim the entire planet and there is no space for runners-up in the solar system.&#10;&#10;The solar system consists of 12 planets, each of them surrounded by six grid points where battle stations may be placed. Some grid points border several planets, hence making their battle stations more powerful. You claim a planet if you have the most battle stations at the end of a round. You win if you claim 3/4/5 planets (5/4/3 players).&#10;&#10;Each round you compete for the next planet in order. You do so by playing cards representing either two forces (black) or one force (white). One black card may be played each turn together with none or one white card. The black cards must follow suit while the white cards may be played together with any suit.&#10;&#10;When you pass you take the tricks of all forces with a majority and places one battle station for each trick. Also, an early pass gives you an early pick of new cards from a drawing row. However, it makes the remaining tricks easier to get for the other players.&#10;&#10;When the round ends, you claim the planet if you have the most battle stations around it. Also, any previous planets that were tied in previous rounds are reassessed to see if the majority has changed. (Remember that a battle station may reach more planets.) One of the tricks allows you to change the order of the planets to take advantage of well positioned battle stations.&#10;&#10;"

The game was indeed conceived in the Middle Ages by a group of aspiring artists. In those days, it was customary to throw excrements out the balcony to the square, once the work had ended. One day, an artist was hit by it and his friends slammed their hands on the table and called out &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo;. The unlucky artist decided to use it to develop a game that had immediate success since then.&#10;&#10;First, two decks of cards are to be prepared. One of the two decks only include characters cards to be dealt to players, the other one includes all the other cards, representing the points, or so called tons of shit!&#10;&#10;The second deck has to be positioned at the center of the table so that it is possible for players to easily reach it with their hands.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the counter-clockwise cards dealing, 4 cards each player. Players must quickly choose one of the cards in their hand and pass it to the opponent to the right while picking up at the same time the card that the opponent to the left is handing over.&#10;&#10;When a player has a four of a kind (poker) hand must immediately pound the hand firmly on the center deck on the table, while shouting: Shit! All the other players must pound their hands on top of the one who pounded the deck first and called Shit!&#10;&#10;The last player pounding the deck has to draw a card from it, which value represents the &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; (tons) of Shit picked up.&#10;&#10;Watch out! The same rules applies if a player accidentally touches the central deck and subsequently has to draw a Shit! card right away. For this reason, it is possible to bluff by shouting Shit! or by pretending to pound the deck, in order to induce opponents to pound the deck too, by mistake, and therefore be forced to drawing the Shit! card. The winner is the Player summing up less &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; (tons) of Shit, once the cards central deck is depleted.&#10;&#10;"
