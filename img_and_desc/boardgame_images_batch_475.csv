This game, part of the Musket and Pike Battle Series, simulates six battles of the early Thirty Years War. In the period covered, the armies deployed in more compact formations so each battle fits on half of a standard map.&#10;&#10;The battles covered in this game are:&#10;&#10;White Mountain&#10;November, 1620&#10;The combined army of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, the Count of Tilly, strike a blow directly at the Bohemian capital of Prague. The Bohemians make a stand on the slopes of White Mountain outside the town. Their Transylvanian allies desert them at the most critical point of the battle, causing the total collapse of the Bohemian army and its cause.&#10;&#10;This is a short scenario where the qualitatively superior Catholic forces must crush the strongly positioned Bohemians who are bolstered by a large Transylvanian contingent of questionable reliability.&#10;&#10;Wimpfen&#10;May, 1622&#10;Tilly joins forces with the Spanish under Cordoba. Together they pursue the smaller army of the Markgraf of Baden-Durlach. They catch his army near the town of Wimpfen, where it is drawn up in a defensive position in a river bend. The Badian camp is fortified in a special traditional way with Spie&szlig;wagen (&quot;pikewagons&quot;), mobile barricades equipped with sharp poles and small mortars. Only when a powder wagon detonates in the midst of the Protestant position, scattering the defenders, the Catholics are able to storm the wagonburg and heavy fighting breaks out.&#10;&#10;A balanced pitched battle. A larger Catholic army tries to defeat a Protestant army that is not only protected by a wagonburg but also possesses a strong cavalry force for counterattacks.&#10;&#10;H&ouml;chst&#10;June, 1622&#10;The Bavarians under Tilly catch the forces of the zealous Protestant Duke Christian as they try to cross the river Main. To protect the crossing, Christian makes a stand at a stream. At first Tilly hesitates, but eventually the Bavarians attack and the Protestant army dissolves in a chaotic retreat.&#10;&#10;A rearguard situation, where the Protestants must delay the Catholics while simultaneously trying to retreat the majority of their army to safety.&#10;&#10;Fleurus&#10;August, 1622&#10;Defeated and demoralized, the combined forces of the condottiere Mansfeld and Duke Christian try to escape the German theater and enter the service of the United Provinces instead. Cordoba's Spanish army blocks them at Fleurus in what is today Belgium. The unpaid and mutinous Protestants attack at dawn in an attempt to break through. In a vicious five-hour fight, the Spanish hold, but enough Protestants break through to force the Spanish to lift an important siege in the Netherlands.&#10;&#10;This is a smaller pitched battle where a large but very unreliable Protestant army attempts to overwhelm the smaller but more experienced Spanish army. This battle is suitable as an introduction to the game system.&#10;&#10;Stadtlohn&#10;August, 1623&#10;Following the battle of Fleurus, Duke Christian again rebuilds an army with raw recruits to join with Mansfeld in the Netherlands and renew the fight for the Protestant cause. However, he soon finds himself outlawed by the Imperor, unsupported and forced to retreat when Tilly's veteran army bears down on him. The Protestan army, slowed by a massive baggage train attempts a last stand and finds itself caught by Tilly's vanguard when within sight of the Dutch border. True to form, Christian decides to risk his army to save his baggage train, but ends up losing both.&#10;&#10;A race-against-the-clock rearguard situation where the focus is on the fate of the Protestant baggage train that is slowly moving towards the map edge.&#10;&#10;Lutter am Barenberge&#10;August, 1626&#10;The Danish King Christian IV intervenes in the Thirty Years War and pushes Tilly back during the early summer. However, he finds himself outnumbered and on the defensive when Tilly is reinforced by Imperial troops. Christian decides to turn on his pursuers and gives battle in a strong defensive position at Lutter am Barenberge. The initial Catholic attacks are repulsed, but the subsequent uncontrolled Danish counterattack results in the eventual collapse of the Danish army.&#10;&#10;This is also a rearguard battle, but with more evenly matched armies, though the Danes are severely hampered by an unusual command situation.&#10;&#10;In addition to scenario specific special rules that highlight the unique events of each battle, the battles in the game all share a simple set of special rules. These rules show the peculiarities of the early years of the Thirty Years War, such as Croat/Transylvanian style light cavalry.&#10;&#10;Even though not all of the battles included were equal contests in military terms, the player victory conditions are balanced. Along with the special rules, that means the battles are interesting for both sides.&#10;&#10;"

How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?&#10;&#10;Mage Wars &mdash; redubbed Mage Wars Arena in 2015 to distinguish it from Mage Wars Academy &mdash; pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts &ndash; all of this and more await you in the arena of Mage Wars!&#10;&#10;Mage Wars is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.&#10;&#10;Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells &ndash; such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments &ndash; are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.&#10;&#10;Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.&#10;    The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.&#10;    The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.&#10;    The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.&#10;&#10;&#10;The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.&#10;&#10;New Mages will be released every few months to add new spells, powers, and variety to the game.

The fight is initiated between two randomly chosen men who must throw the first punch at each other before any other characters can join in.&#10;&#10;The game includes counters for townsfolk such as piano players, saloon girls, and the bartender, each of whom has strength and dexterity characteristics and may get involved in the fight.

Then you&rsquo;re here, wherever that may be, everything looks strange but familiar, like looking through a cracked mirror. The other passengers are here too, and they found a device they say can take you all home. How do they know? Who knows indeed? It&rsquo;s worth a shot, anyway you&rsquo;re not liking the sounds of whatever is approaching.&#10;&#10;You and the others have fallen through the dimensions that make the multiverse, an infinity of alternate realities where the best utopias and the worst nightmares can be found.

Each turn, the players will encounter a historical figure in a new dimension where things are different and must somehow be righted: a ruthless Benjamin Franklin has sided with the machines to destroy mankind and must be stopped, a benevolent Genghis Khan needs help surviving in a dying world... those are but a few of the thousands of possible missions the players will have to complete before going home.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player receives a character card, indicating their strengths and weaknesses along five stats (Status, Fight, Intellect, Stealth and Tech). Each turn, by revealing one of each Alternate World, Target and Mission cards, the players get to face one of over 25000 challenges. As a group, they decide who will attempt the mission and pool their relevant stats to form the mission dice pool. Scoring more successes than the target in the contest set by the Mission card will allow the other players to repair the Navigator device. It's up to the players to assess their chances against various challenges and decide when to use the precious power left in the Navigator until they reveal the Earth Prime card hidden among 29 Alternate World cards to win the game. However the players can lose the game if the Navigator runs out of power or if they run out of World cards.&#10;&#10;"

Each player chooses a colour and places that card in front of them. It has no part in the game other than to remind players who has which colour. I don't know why but the rules say that &quot;this colour is kept for the WHOLE EVENING&quot;. (Their capital letters, not mine).&#10;The deck is shuffled and each player gets 10 cards. The remaining undealt cards form a face-down draw pile. A player may, in turn, play one card in the middle of the board as in dominoes. Then the player replenishes his hand by drawing a card from the pool. The winner is the player who has the colour of the last card played when the pool is exhausted. The rules give a strategy tip - do not play cards of your own colour until victory looms. This will give you a good chance to play for a win.&#10;Betting is suggested as an option, even onlookers are encouraged to bet on who will win.&#10;&#10;"

When one player has moved three of his/her N tokens through the cycle and back to N2, the game is over, and total scores determine the winner.&#10;&#10;To move Nitrogen, players draw and play cards representing soil bacteria and the resources that these bacteria need. They also draw event cards.
