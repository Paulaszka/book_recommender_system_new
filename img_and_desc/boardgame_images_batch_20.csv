Search cards allow you to look behind, under and inside these objects for clues.  Try to add rooms that you suspect contain objects that match Search cards in your hand.  If you have a Search card that matches an object in the same room as your pawn, play it and draw a Clue card.

2393,,"XiangQi is one of the most played board games in the world. Translated loosely as &quot;elephant game&quot;, the name of XiangQi may have first been recorded in Songs of Chu during the 4th century BC of early China; in the state of Qi during the Warring State Period, the name &quot;XiangQi&quot; meant ivory Liubo pieces, not modern XiangQi played by Chinese. The modern Xiangqi set dates back to the Tang dynasty.&#10;&#10;Based closely on ancient Chinese military strategy, XiangQi draws comparisons to European Chess, and indeed, both are descended from the ancient Indian game of Chaturanga.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;XiangQi, commonly referred to in English as &quot;Chinese Chess&quot;, is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a board that is 9 lines wide and 10 lines long. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the game board. The area of play is divided into two territories by a river in the middle of game board. In each territory there is a 3 line by 3 line palace, in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to capture the opponents's General/Marshal.&#10;&#10;The pieces on both sides and their movements &amp; special rules are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    1 General: 1 Point orthogonally within the palace only. Not allowed to &lsquo;see&rsquo; the enemy General on an open file.&#10;    2 Advisors: 1 point diagonally within the palace only.&#10;    2 Chariots: Any distance orthogonally.&#10;    2 Cannons: Moves like a Chariot. To capture, it must first leap over an intervening piece of either color.&#10;    2 Horses: 1 point orthogonally, then one point diagonally.&#10;    2 Elephants / Ministers: 2 points diagonally. Cannot cross the river.&#10;    5 Soldiers: 1 point straight forward.  Once across the river, can also move 1 point sideways instead.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pieces capture as they move and never jump. The only exception (for both rules) apply to the cannon.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The price of the game varies depending on the material used in the game.

However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.&#10;&#10;"
2397,,"Backgammon is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.&#10;&#10;Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.&#10;&#10;The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board. It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game&quot;. The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan of Tabula that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).&#10;&#10;The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.&#10;&#10;"

It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.&#10;&#10;The origin date listed for this game is approximate.&#10;&#10;"
2399,,"Senet is an ancient Egyptian board game similar to backgammon.  Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path.  Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest boardgames but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result scholars has made several educated guesses as to the rules.  The most popular versions are in the files section.&#10;&#10;It may be a relative of Aseb and The Royal Game of Ur.&#10;&#10;"

2427,,"One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games, highly prized by collectors.&#10;&#10;This one is the American War of Independence game. The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.&#10;&#10;The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.&#10;&#10;A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).&#10;&#10;A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).&#10;&#10;Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.&#10;&#10;The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.&#10;&#10;The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.&#10;&#10;"

You race to be the first to assemble your skeleton on its scaffold.&#10;&#10;Spin the spinner and hope to get the correct bone.  The ring is wild.  When you get a stake, you collect one; if you collect three, you return the stakes and a bone to the coffin.  In the advanced game, you have the option of challenging another vampire instead.  Both challengers spin in turn, and the first to get a ring wins; if the challenger wins, the loser loses a bone.  If the challenged wins, the challenger loses two bones.&#10;&#10;"

2437,,"BoneGames produces a number of do-it-yourself free games.  You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.&#10;&#10;The Barons of Fyn is a card based strategy game in which competing players each try to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn.&#10;&#10;The Great King Timothy has decided he will leave his kingdom, Fyn, and fight in the great crusades.  While he is gone, he trusts the nobility of the land will behave themselves, as good nobles should.  Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.&#10;&#10;The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.  The standard game is played until King Timothy returns to Fyn, at which point, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn?&#10;&#10;The game features a dynamic board that is generated as the players lay land cards; however, instead of a Kings-and-Things style board, this one combines some features of Illuminati, in the sense that each player's layout is independent of the others', except that when a group of cards is captured, the entire group is slid to your layout for hook-up, possibly discarding cards that can't fit (that would cause an overlap).&#10;&#10;"

2439,,"Queen Victoria's Navy is a nautical combat war game for two players which simulates the period from 1880-1906.  The game scale is 500 meters per hex and about 5 minutes per turn.  Capital ships are modeled individually.  Complexity is medium.  Time to learn is from 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of squadron commanders, the principal tactical leaders in the battle fleet.  As such, they are in charge of a manageable force of capital ships, generally 3-12.  Designed for 2 players, Queen Victoria's Navy is also suitable for solitaire or multiple players, each scenario taking about 1 hour to complete.&#10;&#10;This game manages to blend three often contradictory goals together seamlessly: affordability, game-play, and authenticity.  The focus of the game is to recreate the conditions of a capital ship battle.  Torpedo boats, gunboats and sundry other smaller vessels have been left out of the game as they were not critical components of the Battle Fleet concept, and their inclusion would have added complexity and cost to the game.  However, thanks to the simplicity of the rules, it is an easy task to design these craft for your own games.&#10;&#10;"

It may seem similar to other games, but Bones has a unique aspect that makes game play very different from what you might expect!  Can you deal with the overlapping of pieces better than your opponent?&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 9x12 grid, with pieces that measure 1x2; each player gets a set of 18 pieces, but more can be made if necessary.  The first tile must be played so it occupies part of the middle; later tiles can be played anywhere as long as they're entirely within the playing area and as long as it does not cover up an already played tile in one move (in other words, it's OK to cover a tile completely, but this must be done in two turns).&#10;&#10;"
