9564,,"William the Conqueror - 1066 is a two or three player tactical wargame which recreates the Battles of Stamford Bridge and Senlac Hill (more commonly known as the Battle of Hastings), the most decisive battles ever fought on English soil. The results of these battles profoundly changed the course of English history and language. At Stamford Bridge, the Viking invasion of England was repulsed by the Anglo-Saxon army, while three weeks later, at Senlac Hill, the Norman invaders successfully defeated the Anglo-Saxon army and were able to conquer the whole of England. The outcome of the Battle of Senlac Hill was a direct result of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In a campaign game, players play the Battle of Stamford Bridge first. Then the Battle of Senlac Hill is played with an order of battle determined by the outcome of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Either game may be played independently of the other.&#10;&#10;1066 uses a revolutionary innovation in wargaming entitled the MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM. There is no die to throw nor any card to choose. The result of an attack depends entirely upon how intelligently you move, not the luck of the die. The MOVEMENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM consists of the attacker moving adjacent to an enemy unit, then both players moving one hex simultaneously. The result of this move determines the result of the attack.&#10;&#10;"

If the player guesses incorrectly, the play moves to the next person.  If the riddle is answered with the aid of a clue, the player may move four spaces , or jump over one wall of the maze.  If the riddle is solved without the aid of a clue, the player may either, move seven spaces, jump over one wall and move forward four spaces, jump over two consecutive walls, or jump an opponents piece over one wall.  There are other special spaces named 'pits of ignorance'.  If a player lands on one of these spaces their turn ends. To get out they must answer a riddle correctly, without a clue, on their next turn.  Upon answering a riddle the player rolls the dice and plays a normal turn.  When a player moves their piece to the center of the board, they must answer a riddle correctly, without a clue, in order to win the game.  If their answer is incorrect, their piece remains at the center of the board and another riddle is asked each subsequent turn.&#10;&#10;"

9610,,"This harness racing game is one of a number of Alga games that deals with horses and horse racing. See also J&#195;&#164;gersro and M&#195;&#165;nvalla med V5.&#10;&#10;A full game consists of six starts divided into three phases (2 starts each). Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short &quot;training track&quot; on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.&#10;&#10;Results of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.&#10;&#10;The actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.&#10;&#10;After the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.&#10;&#10;Approximate play sequence:&#10;&#10;1) Auction - buy a number of horses&#10;2) Train them for the race&#10;3) Select horses for race 1&#10;4) Betting phase&#10;5) Run short race&#10;6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.&#10;7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race&#10;8) repeat 1-6 twice&#10;9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.&#10;&#10;"

9625,,"Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century.  Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.&#10;&#10;From the designer:&#10;Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.&#10;&#10;"

9627,,"FOUR SQUARE is a fast-moving game that's easy to learn. It's sort of a combination of concentration and rummy. The three face card characters in the deck represent the qualities that help to win. They are  LUCK,   BRAINS,  and  COURAGE.  It takes  LUCK  to draw the right card at the right time, BRAINS  to remember cards you only see once, and  COURAGE  to save for a FOUR SQUARE call. The objective is to go out early and catch your opponents with big counts in their hands. There are two ways to go out. One is to  KNOCK,  betting that you have the lowest hand around the table. The other is to build a hand with four-of-a-kind. During the play, hands are kept face down on the table and arranged in a square, hence the name &quot;FOUR SQUARE.&quot; In either case, the losing players' scores are increased by the number of the points in their hands, in some cases doubled or tripled, as later described. The game continues until at least one player has a total score of 100 or more. The player with the lowest score is the winner. In case of a tie, the winners share the honor.&#10;&#10;"
