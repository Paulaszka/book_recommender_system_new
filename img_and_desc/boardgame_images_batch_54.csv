November-December 1805.&#10;&#10;Map covers the territory from Znaim and Brunn to Olmutz and Ostrava, with the regular 2 miles to the hex. And it can mate with the &quot;1809&quot; map (Victory Games), allowing for a precession of the campaign through Durrenstein and Znaim.&#10;&#10;The campaign scenario begins on 15 November, with the Russians retiring on Br&uuml;nn and the French in pursuit. A second scenario begins with the French spread out around Br&uuml;nn and the Coalition forces in Olm&uuml;tz. Fortunately for Napoleon, the Allies attacked, but what if they had not? With the imminent entry of Prussia into the war, Napoleon would have been forced to advance on Olm&uuml;tz, and his forces would have been beyond their LOC.&#10;&#10;Detailing Napoleon's campaign in Moravia, 1805, Sun of Austerliz is the only game to simulate the whole campaign at the operational level (2 mi/2 days/1,000 men) from the Fall of Vienna through the actions of Hollabrunn, Schoengrabern, and Wischau, to Austerlitz.&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: CAMPAIGNS System - Series 1X = &#10;- scale = 3,200m/hex, &#10;- time = 2 days/turn&#10;- strength = 1,000 men/SP, .&#10;&#10;"

6201,,"This is a fairly complex strategy game featuring resource management and trading.  The objective is to move one of your player tokens to the 9th circle and defeat Lucifer.&#10;&#10;The initial setup is the outer ring of the board. Each tile is two rings and the tiles are numbered. Players take turns placing 3 of their player tokens on the tile of their choice.  Each tile corresponds to one of four resources.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each player's turn, two dice are rolled.  A 7 brings a demon into play in a corner of that player's choice.  Any other number will result in some players gaining resources. Rolling doubles gives your regular allotment of resources, plus a resource of your choice.  Rolling 2 or 12 allows you to place a marker on one tile that either doubles or eliminates production for that tile.&#10;&#10;Players can use their resources to bring out new player tokens, buy new tiles for inner circles of hell, move themselves, descend deeper into hell, move others, flip tiles, or alter die rolls.  Players can trade resources with other players during their turn.  The lower circles of hell generate more resources (2 for 3/4, 3 for 5/6 and 4 for 7/8).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player descends to the ninth level and defeats Lucifer by rolling a 10 or better on two dice.&#10;&#10;"

6203,,"On a cold, foggy morning in November, 1942, a four-hour artillery barrage rocked the Rumanian lines north and south of Stalingrad. Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don &ndash; entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein&rsquo;s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.&#10;&#10;Enemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps &ndash; their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run&hellip;and when to strike.&#10;&#10;Enemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios. The game covers Operation Uranus, Operation Little Saturn, the German Relief and airlift efforts, and Operation Star and Gallup (to include von Manstein&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;backhand blow&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;Extensively researched, playtested, and developed, Enemy at the Gates will satisfy the Eastern Front interest of any gamer who wants to know more than the pulp-history version of these pivotal events!&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;&#10;    Dynamic and fluid situation&#10;    All of the pivotal battles in AG South&#10;    The creation of the Stalingrad pocket&#10;    The relief effort and airlift&#10;    Mansteins famous Backhand Blow!&#10;    Follow-on to the popular Guderian's Blitzkrieg: The Drive on Moscow game and system- refined based on player feedback&#10;    Player skill is highly rewarded&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;    Turn: Half-week&#10;    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km&#10;    Units: Battalion to Army&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;&#10;    Four 22 x 34&quot; maps (Maps A, B, C &amp; D)&#10;    One 8 x 11&quot; Stalingrad 'Blow-Up' map&#10;    Eight dual-side printed countersheets (5 combat, 3 markers - 2,800 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;    One 36-page OCS rules booklet&#10;    One 36-page Enemy at the Gate game specific rules booklet&#10;    Two 6-page OCS version 2.0 Charts &amp; Tables Folders&#10;    Four Player Aid cards&#10;    Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Complexity: High&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Playing Time: 4-100 hours&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;&#10;(from the Game Box)&#10;&#10;&#10;All 4 maps were changed and reprinted in 2001.&#10;Updated and replaced by Case Blue.&#10;&#10;"

6205,,"from GMT website:&#10;&#10;More than thirteen years of design and development have gone into the making of Europe Engulfed (EE), which is GMT Games' first offering to the block-game enthusiast. It covers the entirety of World War II in Europe from September 1939 to the end of 1945.&#10;&#10;Europe Engulfed plays fast with its focus on playability and making players feel the pressures their historical counterparts were under. The game achieves this level of playability without sacrificing historical detail. The entire campaign is playable in a single 10-to-14 hour day once players become familiar with its elegant game systems including:&#10;&#10;Wood Block Units:&#10;Wood blocks for land units provide a realistic fog of war. Only the controlling player can see if their units are armor or infantry, weak or strong until combat is engaged. The inability to know the strength of your opponent ensures that even the most experienced players will make their fair share of tactical and strategic errors.&#10;&#10;Production and Strategic Warfare:&#10;Europe Engulfed Game Turns represent two months each and production and strategic warfare takes place within each of these turns. The inventive production system shows that the conquering power does not get the same value out of resource areas as the original power that lost them. Production levels are easy to calculate and production choices include special actions, fleets, U-boats, strategic fighter and bomber assets, ground-support units, flak, V-weapons, and, of course, lots and lots of armor and infantry and the odd paratrooper or cavalry unit from which to choose.&#10;&#10;Special Actions:&#10;Special actions are an innovative rule system to account for the large historical territorial gains that occurred over the course of a two-month game turn without bogging the game down with multiple player turns. Using Special Actions, players can purchase additional movement phases and combat rounds, amphibious and airborne assaults, and even take actions during an opponent's combat phase.&#10;&#10;Rulebook and Playbook:&#10;The 24-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples. Also included is a 24-page playbook. The playbook includes player notes, designer notes, optional rules, scenarios, index, and an extended example of play highlighting the May/June 1940 turn which reveals tactics for successfully attacking and defending.&#10;&#10;Europe Engulfed plays quickly with a very historical feel. Many players have indicated that they actually feel the pressures and stresses felt by the strategic level commanders in the real war. We know of no other European Theater of Operations game that plays this fast and with this much historical value.&#10;&#10;Play Times:&#10;1939 Campaign: Up to 14 hours&#10;1941 Campaign: Up to 10 hours&#10;Blockskrieg!: Up to 6 hours&#10;European War: Up to 5 hours&#10;'42 - '43 two-map scenario: 4 hours&#10;'42 - '43 one-map scenario: 3 hours&#10;Patton's Fantasy scenario: 2 hours&#10;&#10;Integrates with: &#10;&#10;    Asia Engulfed&#10;&#10;&#10;"

There are many scenarios and a campaign as well.&#10;&#10;Designer's Note:&#10;As people who are familiar with the Dunnigan treatment of 20th Century tactical combat in Sniper! and Patrol will note, the broad outlines of StarSoldier have much in common with those two earlier SPI games.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with StarForce and Outreach.&#10;&#10;"

Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.&#10;&#10;In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.&#10;&#10;The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.&#10;&#10;Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex.

Unlike traditional chess, the goal isn&rsquo;t to capture pieces but to strategically maneuver them through obstacles and special zones.&#10;&#10;The game features a board of special shape with alternating black and white squares, where each player controls half the board. The objective is to move your Mates (which moves like chess bishop) to the opponent&rsquo;s home squares. However, the path is filled with challenges: Deserts immobilize pieces, Shadows must stay near Mates, Trees can move only once per game, and Rabbits can only leap over obstacles, etc.&#10;&#10;With diverse piece abilities and shared control, Maze demands careful coordination, long-term planning, and creative problem-solving. Victory is achieved only when all Mates reach their destinations, making every move a step toward mutual success&mdash;or shared defeat. Perfect for players who enjoy deep strategy and teamwork.&#10;&#10;"
