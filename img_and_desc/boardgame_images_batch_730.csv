Acquiring trade goods is very quick and simple. Players&#10;draft cards from a deck of goods and add them to their hands. The first player draws cards equal to twice the number of players (for example, 6 cards for a 3 player game) chooses one and passes the rest to the next player. The rest of the players do the same, except for the last. The last player, chooses 2 cards then passes the rest to the previous player. This happens until the first player takes the last remaining card. (example: Nick, John and Mary have 6 cards to draft. Nick goes first chooses 1, then passes 5 cards to John. John also chooses 1, then passes 4 cards to Mary. Mary chooses 2 then passes 2 cards to John. John chooses 1 then passes the last card to Nick.)&#10;&#10;During the 2nd phase, players deploy their trade goods gathered from the 1st phase on planets of their choice. But the real reward is not money. The real reward is the trade agreement that may be established with a planet. If such a trade agreement is active, a player may benefit from it later on the game.&#10;Planets are divided in Age I and Age II. Age I planets provide trade agreements and just a few credits, while Age II planets provide lots of credits but no trade agreements.&#10;&#10;"

205500,,"User summary&#10;Tobi-Sugoroku is a traditional Japanese game developed from the original game Joudo-Sugoroku. Tobi means 'Jumping', and as in Joudo-Sugoroku, players move differently across the board using dice rolls and following the instructions on the squares. As with other classical Japanese games, the original designers' and illustrators are not known.&#10;&#10;However, later Tobi-Sugoroku do not keep the Buddhist theme, and instead reflect various popular subjects (New Year, ghosts and monsters, warriors and heroes, morality). This allowed the publishers to produce beautifully illustrated prints in the Edo period, and 19C and 20C magazines to have Sugoroku games as cheap pull-outs.&#10;&#10;The main difference between Tobi-Sugoroku and Mawari-Sugoroku is that in the former, movement is across the network of squares, whereas in the latter, movement is along a controlled path (similar to Game of Goose). Any Sugoroku game with pictures is known as E-Sugoroku (E- means 'picture').&#10;&#10;"

Each location tile gives victory points and may generate resources (skill tiles or connectors that connect two location tiles). Connectors and skill tiles can be used to upgrade location tiles for additional victory points and productivity.&#10;&#10;The game is played over four eras, and in each era, new location tiles will be available for bidding. In both era 1 and 2, these tiles consist of six resource-generating tiles, plus some additional building tiles.  In era 3, there will be only building tiles, which arrive already upgraded. In era 4, some of the Routemaster tiles become available.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player chooses one of five actions. They may use one or more of their team of wooden workers (&quot;keyples&quot;) to (1) bid for a location tile, (2) use a location tile to generate resources, or (3) upgrade a location. They may (4) pass, in which case they may play again in that era, or (5) cease playing in that era by setting off in their sailing barge along the Thames. The game finishes after the last river barge sets sail at the end of era 4, at which point the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Key to the City &ndash; London has similarities in structure to the award-winning 2012 R&amp;D game Keyflower.&#10;&#10;"

You&rsquo;ll need both a tactical approach as well as a fair amount of luck. Two to four players meet in this game for a struggle of sheer survival. Only the player who&rsquo;s best prepared and whose cards match the conditions can obtain the opponents&rsquo; cards and collect points.&#10;&#10;Before each turn a player &ndash; the Darwin &ndash; rolls the dice. The combination of number (1 to 8) and colour (blue, green and yellow) determine which card becomes the trump during this turn. Additionally, one die (with + and -) specifies if high or low numbers have an advantage.&#10;Each player then plays a card upside down and then flip them over simultaneously. The player of the strongest card wins, becomes the new Darwin and rolls the dice for the next turn.&#10;&#10;The strongest card is either the trump or &ndash; of no trump has been played &ndash; the highest or the lowest card. If it comes to a draw, the size of the animal is of the essence (+ for big / - for small). But there are three special cards as well:&#10;The red cards (1 to 8), if they should win a turn, although they are not able of becoming the trump and will always lose in a draw, they can destroy the collected cards of the player with the second best card.&#10;The grey cards (0 and 9) are always the highest or lowest numbers. They can only be beaten by the trump.&#10;The brown cards (4.5) are the worst cards, because they are neither the highest nor the lowest cards - they are right in the middle. But if the trump has been played, they are the only ones able to beat it.&#10;&#10;A game consists of several rounds, each consisting of individual turns. Each turn consists of rolling the dice and playing one card. A round is over when all the hand cards have been played. The game is over when the card deck is used up.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round &ndash; after all the hand cards have been played &ndash; the points of the cards, according to the number of symbols in the corner, are counted and written down. These points are safe and cannot be destroyed. &#10;At the end of the game &ndash; when the card deck is used up &ndash; the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"
