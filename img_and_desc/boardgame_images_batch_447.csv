The event took place on 28-30 June 1651. After a few lost battles Polish-Lithuanian Republic managed to consolidate its forces - in number of about 60 thousand - and stopped about 80 thousand army of Cossacks led by Bohdan Chmielnicki and 30 thousand Tatars. Game mechanics try to reflect the way the battle was carried out but is not a typical battle simulation. Units can reatreat using a bridge on river Styr or across swamps. Players' aim is to eliminate each other's pieces.&#10;&#10;

In the shadow of an old palm tree four bold nomad sons are planning a dare-devil adventure. What is their plan? Will they really try to cross the desert by the infamous west route? Don't they know the treacherous quicksand and all those other dangers which lie in wait for them? Have no fear! With cautiousness, good companionship and some luck this route is passable. Each caravan still has one place open - dare this adventure and join them!&#10;&#10;The rules:&#10;Each player has three pawns with which to reach the large oasis in the middle of the board. Pawns are moved by throwing the die. A pawn can get stuck in quicksand, and then has to be rescued by another pawn of the same player. (Optional: or by rolling a six.) A rescued pawn is carried on the back of the other to the next oasis, where the pawn which was stuck has to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the player.&#10;&#10;When a pawn ends its move on a field where another pawn already is, it can climb on the others back, and be carried/ported by it. This is possible with both your own or other players pawns. (Multiply carrying is allowed.) However: a carried pawn should hop off  before reaching the next oasis, as once the porter reaches it, it will drop off all carried pawns in the oasis! And likewise with resting pawns from being stuck in the quicksand: formerly carried pawns will have to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the corresponding player.&#10;&#10;When a pawn ends it turn on a place from which a short track continues (shown by a road sign), this may be taken on the next turn. Any carried pawns are carried along.&#10;To reach the end oasis, a pawn has to reach it, either by throwing the required number exactly or higher.&#10;&#10;Winner of this adventurous journey is the player who has crossed the desert with his or her three pawns first.&#10;&#10;"

For example, Roman legionaries would have a high UCV due to their better equipment, good leadership, and regular training while barbarian tribesmen would have a lower UCV.&#10;&#10;Combat is divided into shooting, impact, and melee. Unit's abilities are divided into strengths and weaknesses in these areas. For example, a barbarian unit may have a high impact value, meaning that they have a formidable first charge, but their value in an ensuing melee is less imposing.&#10;&#10;The figure scales used for the game is 1:50 (one model figure representing 50 actual men) and the time scale is one turn equals approximately 60 minutes. The game attempts to allow entire ancient battles to be fought out in miniature on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;At the time it was published, Milgamex' &quot;Ancient Warfare&quot; emerged as a potential rival to the popularity of WRG's &quot;Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles.&quot; However, they could not push WRG's rules out of the place they had gained in international competition play.

Each has been contrived to show a historic resolution, fun for the English player, depressing for the French. Azincourt (French spelling) is a unique approach. The French might have had more coordinated leadership. They might not have been so intent on an easy victory, and as a result been so careless. They might have taken advantage of the vulnerable English advance. They might have waited for the English to wear themselves out crossing the muddy field and allowed Henry to make the first attack. They might have employed their crossbows to better effect. Had they better control of their troops, crowded conditions would not have reduced combat effectiveness. Finally, had they considered avenues for retreating units, disruption of fresh units would not been such a problem.&#10;&#10;In Azincourt I address a number of these what-ifs but, moreover, I offer players the unique mechanic of commanding one flank of each opposing army. In effect players play BOTH the French AND the British. It works out much better than you would expect. Since the English line is necessarily pretty static, there is little problem in coordinating an English defense while splitting command of the French in the face of the enemy mirrors the historically poor French command.&#10;&#10;Azincourt is a card assisted, counter and hex game utilizing large colorful counters and a variety of aids that allows for a key battle component which other versions neglect to emphasize - the capture of nobles for ransom. Integral to Azincourt play is the capture of these nobles, English and French (including King Henry), of varying value. Ah and then there are the complications that such nobles bring. Wounded nobles become easy targets. Captured nobles make targets of their captors. Then there are Henry's terrible archers ... who WILL run out of arrows, and then what? To add to the game's variety is a random set-up and reinforcemnt schedule that toys with a number of possible historical possibilities.&#10;&#10;Playtesting has been a blast so far but continues so no publisher has yet committed.
