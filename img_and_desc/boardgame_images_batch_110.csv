Movement is  accomplished by spinner, allowing a token to move up to six spaces along a path. Various spaces picturing fruits and vegetables give movement bonuses or penalties.  A player may only move one token during his turn.  This gives the game a certain amount of strategy, as landing on the same space as an opponent's token will send him back to the previous penalty space.&#10;&#10;"

You have two distinct tactical options: raiding (stealthy movement and silent killing) and assault (speed, aggression and liberal use of firepower). Whichever way you decide to tackle your mission, you have just 60 minutes to accomplish it before the Stronghold is locked down &ndash; after which, escape will be impossible.&#10;&#10;Playing the Stronghold Commander offers a strategic as well as tactical challenge. You take control of the Axis war base, deploy your Sentries to create defensive zones and send out a senior Officer to investigate reports of intruder activity.  When you have identified the threat and located the agents, raise the alarm and mobilise your Guards. Don&rsquo;t let them leave your Stronghold alive!&#10;&#10;"
