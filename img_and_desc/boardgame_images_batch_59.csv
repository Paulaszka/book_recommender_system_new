Thus the Greek is encouraged to batter through some of the Persian foot and close with the cav before turn 4 if possible.&#10;&#10;All in all, a fine simulation given the scope of the system rules. The Persians' only good chance is to resist the Greek hoplites with foot until turn 4 and then try and turn any Greek flank possible, by moving their cavalry away and around the Greeks and charging them in clear terrain - if the Greeks allow themselves to be exploited this way, of course.&#10;&#10;"

The first reference about this game goes back to 1745, when Don Manuel de Larramendi, philologist and Jesuit basque, quoted it in the trilingual dictionary (Basque-Spanish-Latin).&#10;&#10;It is played by two opposing pairs of players with the Spanish deck, which is a deck of 40 cards without eights or nines and no jokers. Usually all 4 &quot;3&quot; cards count as kings and all four &quot;2&quot; cards count as aces. It has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain.&#10;&#10;In every round of the game Mus (discard) is either agreed or stopped. Then, four bets are made on the same hand of cards:&#10;    * Grande (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards; handiak (big ones) in Basque.&#10;    * Peque&ntilde;a or Chica (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards.&#10;    * Pares (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination; pareak in Basque.&#10;    * Juego (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round; jokua in Basque.&#10;At last, accepted bets and passes are counted until one of the pairs of players reaches the previously agreed amount (different standards in different regions of Spain, but most commonly 30). The pair of players winning most out of three games wins a vaca (which means cow in spanish), and the pair winning most out of three vacas win the match.&#10;&#10;One other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player only is obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes it a poor card game to watch other people play, and learning to play it through only watching is rather difficult in comparison with other card games.&#10;&#10;"

Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.&#10;&#10;Like all such games, it works well with the right crowd.&#10;&#10;Second edition:&#10;&#10;Hear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as &quot;Nuclear BLANK&quot;). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.&#10;&#10;What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.&#10;&#10;"
