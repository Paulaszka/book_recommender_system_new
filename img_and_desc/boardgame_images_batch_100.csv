Both versions include 168 word cards, but the Junior version has only one word per side as opposed to three randomly chosen words of varying difficulty. The Squint Junior cards also show a picture of the word made from the card shapes, so the child just finds the right cards and duplicates the image. For a Light version, the sand timer is not used, and for an Expert version, the player ignores the picture on the card and comes up with their own interpretation.&#10;&#10;Reimplements: Squint&#10;&#10;"

11415,,"Warriors is a card and dice-rolling game with a fantasy military theme. Each player begins with a randomly dealt army of 11 units. Most will be creatures of one of the game's 6 types (Barbarians, Goblins, Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Undead). A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).&#10;&#10;Armies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One (&quot;Battle&quot;) allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' &quot;natural enemy&quot;.) The other type of Attack Card (&quot;Mercenary Army&quot;) allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.&#10;&#10;The resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.&#10;&#10;Players gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.&#10;&#10;"

Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia, Iskra being the northern part of the wider Soviet 1942&ndash;1943 winter counter offensive&#10;&#10;The city of Leningrad, second largest in the USSR, had been cut off by the Germans since September 8, 1941. Now, sixteen months later, the Soviets were about to make their third attempt to relieve the city. The first attack in January 1942 had led to the mauling of the 2nd Shock Army in the swamps to the south, and a second failure between Sinyavino and Mga in the summer of 1942 had also taken heavy casualties, although it had completely derailed von Manstein's planned assault on the city itself.

Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.&#10;&#10;On February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.&#10;&#10;Orthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack. Command control plays a critical role, and highlights the differences between Wellington's veteran and well-established command hierarchy and Soult's more makeshift organization. British advantages include numerical superiority, command flexibility and their excellent infantry. The main French advantage is the terrific defensive terrain and the defense of interior lines. Make no mistake though, this is a very tough battle for the French.&#10;&#10;In addition to the main battle scenario, there are several smaller scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a long evening. A variety of optional rules are included to provide replayability and variability for face to face or solitaire play.&#10;&#10;La Bataille D'Orthez will feature two hand drawn maps of the battlefield by Rick Barber, as well as 420 state of the art counters and the usual assortment of charts and tables.

Their approach goes undetected and they are able to close within two miles. In fact, not until the moment of their assault do the French become aware of them. But, instead of the expected weak flank guard, they are met by the strong divisions of Souham and Girard and by mid-afternoon, Napoleon and 100,000 French and their allies have swarmed to their support. The battle raged in ever-mounting fury until night finally brought an end to the slaughter.

11452,,"Suez '73: The Battle of Chinese Farm: October 15-22, 1973, is a game about the battle that took place the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces, as part of the Yom Kippur War.&#10;&#10;It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula, north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal, near an Egyptian agricultural research station. The farm was using specialized Japanese-made machinery that had Kanji characters on them, so Israeli military maps labeled the area as 'Chinese Farm'.[1][2] The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev (&quot;Stouthearted Men&quot;), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing. Accordingly, the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm.&#10;&#10;Determined Egyptian resistance made progress extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering from a lack of infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.&#10;&#10;The Egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17.

11456,,"This is a fairly simple dice game from which Farkle owes its heritage or other games in the Traditional Dice Games: Dice 10,000 games family.&#10;&#10;Each turn players start with 6 dice and roll them all. Each time a roll is made one or more scoring dice must be removed and the player can chose to stop with the total score they have accumulated or roll on. If no score is made on a roll, the player zilches and all the accumulated score for that turn (not from previous turns)is lost (like Can't Stop). If all the dice are used for scoring then the turn continues with all 6 dice again.&#10;&#10;Scores are &#10;5=50&#10;1=100&#10;3 of a kind = kind X 100&#10;&#10;On a 6 dice roll: 1,2,3,4,5,6 = 1500   &#10;and 3 pairs = 1000 (though six 6s can be 1200 from two triples of 600)&#10;&#10;To win a player knocks instead of rolling on their turn and each other player has one turn to pass the leaders score.&#10;&#10;Also there is an optional rule for the start: A score of less than 500 can not be kept until you are on the board and if a player Zilches on their first three turns they go negative whatever score they had before the final roll of their third turn and can subsequently stop at any score.&#10;&#10;The game is suspenseful as players roll diminishing numbers of dice against increasing odds. It can have longish down time unless you decide to have several players having their turns at the same time with different sets of dice. (faster but less suspenseful).&#10;&#10;"

The players decide who moves first. Then the first player places 1 tile in any of the intersections on the board and the second player does likewise on any unoccupied intersection. Note:  2 players may occupy the center intersection. This is the only point that 2 players can occupy at the same time. The tiles are placed on top of each other.

If any Quirks are made during the placing down of the tiles, the players take one of the opponent's tiles from the board per Quirk.&#10;&#10;After all tiles are placed on the board, the players alternate turns moving a tile per turn to unoccupied intersections of the board. A player cannot jump over a tile and can only move along a straight line. A player may move through more than one intersection as long as it is unoccupied. Squares can be formed in 34 ways and when they are formed the player calls &quot;quirk&quot; and removes one opposing tile from the board. The opponent then takes his/her turn. A player who makes a Quirk and does not call it can have a tile removed by his/her opponent in his/her turn. The opponent can call it, take a tile, and then go on and make his/her move. A player who makes a Quirk cannot make the exact Quirk in a later turn unless all 4 tiles have been at least once removed from the corners.&#10;&#10;"
