It's quite possible that even the murderer him or herself is not aware of what happened last night, since barely anyone remembers anything. Unfortunately, according to the ancient laws of Labamba, the one that kills the Archmage may become a powerful Darchmage, bringing Darkness onto the land. And if there is one thing that Darkness hates, it's fun, techno, lasers and glitter &ndash; which is all that is dear to the magical folk.&#10;Thus, it's time to pull yourselves together, put your holo detective hats on your aching heads and catch the killer, before he grows too powerful!&#10;&#10;RAVEHARD: Magiczna Gra Karciana is a party game that mixes elements of classic card battle games, games of deduction and deception, as well as more cooperative titles.

To achieve this goal, they'll have to overcome dangerous obstacles, including boss fights (each boss capable of summoning powerful minions) and unpredictable events. After each round the players gain a new clue which sheds some light on the last night's incident and points towards a possible murder weapon.&#10;If the players manage to survive all three rounds, they reach the Archmage's Chamber. There they may incapacitate one of them, should they be certain that he's the killer. If they are correct &ndash; they win the game; if they are wrong &ndash; the murderer steps out of the shadows and attacks the rest of the players. The side that emerges victorious from this final confrontation wins the game.&#10;&#10;Do not trust anyone &ndash; not even yourself! Each player starts the game with two different objects which may turn out to be the murder weapons &ndash; or they may prove your innocence. During your turn you may switch the objects with those belonging to other players in order to frame them and clear your name. However, not until the very end will it be possible to tell which object is really the murder weapon. Thus, during the game you'll have to bluff, form alliances, deceive and distract, both openly &ndash; and secretly, using the Flirt Cards that let you pass private messages, scheme and conspire (and flirt).&#10;&#10;This game is for you if you enjoy playing such titles as Magic: The Gathering, Munchkin, Hero Realms, Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards, Love Letter, Mascarade, Coup, Not Alone, PENNY DREADFUN: Duchy, Demony, Dickensy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#197;&#185;le si&#196;&#153; dzieje w magicznym &#197;&#155;wiecie Labamba&hellip;&#10;&#10;Doroczna techno-impreza, na kt&oacute;rej musi pojawi&#196;&#135; si&#196;&#153; ka&#197;&#188;dy&#10;szanuj&#196;&#133;cy si&#196;&#153; mag i czarodziejka, by&#197;&#130;a tak epicka, &#197;&#188;e o poranku&#10;skacowani i zm&#196;&#153;czeni go&#197;&#155;cie odkryli, &#197;&#188;e kto&#197;&#155; zamordowa&#197;&#130;&#10;Arcymaga!&#10;Nie wiadomo jak, nie wiadomo kiedy.

After playing, a player draws again and continues playing until announcing &quot;I am thru&quot;, and the turn goes to the left. One can also make a sentence out of their own words, after which those words cannot be further altered. When a turn is over and other players see plays they could have done, they say &quot;Wobuga&quot; and can make the play for them and score the points they could have scored.&#10;&#10;Points scored are: 5 points for each letter played during one's turn, 10 points for each word of a sentence, and 25 points for making the word &quot;Wobuga&quot;.  The highest score when all the letters are used wins.&#10;&#10;There is also a solitaire mode where a player takes repeated turns and tries to use all the letters.  Also, Wobuga Rush, where two players each play with a half deck in solitaire mode, and play through all their letters.  Each player gets 5 points for each letter not used, and -10 points for being the first to say &quot;I am thru&quot;; the lower score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

276398,,"Skruuvi is a Finnish relative of Auction Whist (which is essentially Bridge without a dummy).&#10;&#10;Like Bridge, it's a four player, partnership trick taking game. Players bid how many of the thirteen tricks their partnership can win (or, unlike Bridge, lose). Also, players can communication information about their hands through their bids (and, unlike Bridge, the cards they can exchange) with a system of conventions. Here are the main differences:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players get to exchange cards with each other. There are two ways of playing Skruuvi depending on how players exchange cards: Kitty games and No-kitty games.&#10;&#10;&#10;- In a Kitty game, players receive 12 cards; the four undealt cards is the kitty. The highest bidder adds the kitty to their hand, then gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then gives one card to each of the other three players.&#10;&#10;- In a No-kitty game, players receive 13 cards. The highest bidder gives any four cards to their partner. The partner adds these cards to their hand, then returns any four cards back to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players optionally play several rounds of Bolshevik, where one player attempts to win or lose all 13 tricks (without a partner).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Players can bid misere, which is a bid of how many tricks a partnership will lose (without a trump suit).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     As mentioned, there is no dummy!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     As in Bridge, the lowest bid is to win 7 out of the 13 tricks. However, the lowest bid you can win the auction round is 11 tricks! (Or for misere bids, to lose 11 tricks!) In No-kitty games, the lowest bid is to win 12 out of the 13 tricks. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A game of Skruuvi lasts 24 rounds. Each player plays with a different partner for 8 rounds each.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

The tile must be built in the square orthogonally adjacent to at least 2 elements: 1 tile and 1 wall, or 2 tiles. And must be built on the leftmost available space of the line it is being built. If the players manage to build orthogonally adjacent to a similar tile, they can as bonus build the next leftmost tile, and so on, until they decide to stop or until they can't build more. Players collect then 1 coin for each coin depicted on the spaces that were left free on their player boards after tiles were built.&#10;&#10;Finally, players end their turn by drawing 1 card into their hand from the 4 cards available on the market. However, the amount of cards players can choose from depends on the number of tiles that they have built. So, if players build only 1 tile, they must take the 1st card. If they build 3 tiles, for example, they can choose between the 1st, 2nd or 3rd cards. Players end their turns by refilling the empty spaces of their player boards with tiles from the facedown stacks.&#10;&#10;As the square is being cooperatively built, certain patterns appear more often than others and the scoring of face-up cards becomes exponential. Also, when players complete a column, they collect a bonus, that can be either 1 coin or drawing more cards. Money is very tight in this game, so gaining an extra coin can be crucial to recruiting a card from your hand face-up.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the square is finished and the player with most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Rossio is all about timing: Recruit a card face-up late in the game, and then it will score fewer times than expected. Recruit it too early, and it will score you a few points since there are few tiles built on the square. To many cards recruited face down will give that extra amount of money, but, they won't score any points. Build several tiles and you're probably helping your opponents. Build fewer tiles and you probably won't have money next turn to recruit a face-up card.&#10;&#10;Rossio is a game with very simple rules, but with high interaction between players and interesting decisions every single turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Every time you press a button, you put a thumb token on that button card to show it's been used. You can press as many buttons as you like, but you can remove tokens from at most four cards at the end of your turn. Every other card with a thumb token still on it is then discarded, so pick your buttons wisely!&#10;&#10;Aside from mashing buttons, you can play cards from your hand by paying the button cost of the card. Fighter cards are powerful and unique to your fighter. You can play multiple fighter cards on your turn as long as you have the buttons to pay for them, and if the last button on a fighter card matches the first button on the next card you play, you need to put a thumb token on that button only once!
