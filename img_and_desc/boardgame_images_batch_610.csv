Red Tide West also presumes a wider conflict beyond the scope of the game, but postulates West Germany to be the so-called &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; for the entire war. In other words, regardless of what is happening in, say, Scandinavia, or the Balkans, or the Middle East, etc., the presumption here is that the war will be won or lost in central Europe. To wit, if the Red Army cripples NATO and overruns West Germany, it is assumed that diplomatic negotiations will then suddenly become advantageous to both sides. For the Soviets, they would be satisfied to end the war with their substantial gains, not to mention the distinction of being regarded by the world as having won the war, especially if a nuclear exchange had not yet occurred. NATO, on the other hand (and especially the French) would want to end the war before the Red Army rolled into France proper, and certainly before a full-blown nuclear war erupted (or escalated further, if a limited nuclear exchange had already occurred).&#10;&#10;On the other side of the coin, if the Red Army&rsquo;s drive into West Germany is halted or thrown back, the war will have run its course then and there, regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the world. Negotiations would be underway, regardless, but the Soviets would have very little to gain (and actually much to lose) by perpetuating a war that is then being perceived as the ultimate reproach of the Soviet state and Communist ideology. Indeed, before Soviet battlefield defeats became prolific and pronounced, and especially before NATO units began to push across the borders of East Bloc countries, the Soviets would be confronted with a choice of trying to negotiate an end to the war before the Warsaw Pact alliance collapsed (or worse, defected&hellip;as if a widespread repeat of the Hungarian Uprising of &lsquo;56), or resort to nuclear strikes to avoid a total defeat (a decidedly undesirable solution when considering NATO&rsquo;s predictable response).&#10;&#10;In any case, Red Tide West presumes a short war whereby the final dispositions will be known within a matter of weeks. The Soviet timetables expected the Red Army to reach the French border within 15 days, and therefore the game excludes Soviet &ldquo;Category C&rdquo; and &ldquo;Category D&rdquo; reserves, which could not have been mobilized within the timeframe of the game&hellip; whether or not the Soviet timetables were realistic in the first place.&#10;&#10;The game includes two maps (22&quot;x34&rdquo;) and 560 counters.&#10;&#10;Design &amp; Development: Eric R.

Alternatively you can win the game by being the first player to finish the dream without waking up.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game starts with the player deciding how many dream fragments they want to resolve. Pleasant ones help you relax, while the unpleasant ones bring you closer to waking up screaming. You can have some of the cards come back later. These you secretly insert anywhere into the dream deck. Will you play to win or to make your opponent lose?&#10;&#10;"

Two coaches lead six players from their respective guilds in a race to 12 points--gaining 4 points for scoring a goal, 2 points for taking out a regular player, and 1 point for taking out a mascot (yes, one of the six players on each team is a mascot). During each turn, coaches alternate activating one player at a time. With a small number of models per side, Guild Ball delivers great depth of strategy, balancing ball control, attack, and defense.&#10;&#10;The strategy in Guild Ball continues with the playbook system. Attacks are resolved by rolling dice against the target's defenses, but dice alone do not dictate the results of attacks. Coaches choose the results of attacks from their players' playbooks: the more successful hits an attack roll generates, the more options from the playbook the coach is able to choose from. Possible results include damage, tackles, knock-downs, pushes, dodges, and powerful character plays that can change the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Guild Ball is also a game of resource management: coaches must manage influence and momentum. Teams start each turn with a pool of influence. In order for a player to attack, kick the ball, or perform a character play, the player needs influence. Coaches allocate influence to players at the start of the turn, so careful planning is required. Momentum is generated by special playbook results and successful passes. Momentum allows a coach to perform special actions, such as taking shots on goal, healing damage, or making out-of-activation dodges. Momentum remaining at the end of a turn also affects the initiative roll for the next turn.&#10;&#10;Featuring 11 unique guilds, each with at least 12 players--and more guilds to be released--Guild Ball allows coaches to choose their own play style.&#10;&#10;"

It is a trick-taking game without trumps, in which the object is to win the last trick.&#10;&#10;Spar is usually played by 2, 3 or 4 players, but it is possible for up to 7 to play. The game uses 35 cards from a standard international 52-card pack, the cards of each suit ranking from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, but the Ace of Spades is normally not used, so the highest card in that suit is the King.&#10;&#10;Play&#10;&#10;Whoever played the highest card of the suit that the first player led is the winner of the trick. The cards played are not gathered in but remain in a face up pile. The winner of the trick leads any card from hand to begin the next trick, playing it face up on top of the pile, and once again the other players must each play a card: this must be the same suit as the card that was led if possible, otherwise any card.&#10;&#10;This continues until five tricks have been played.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;Whoever wins the fifth and last trick wins the hand and scores:&#10;&#10;3 points if the winning card is a 6;&#10;    2 points if the winning card is a 7;&#10;    1 point for winning with any other card - 8 or higher.&#10;&#10;The winner of the hand deals the next hand, and therefore plays last to the first trick of the next hand. The session continues for as long as the players wish - there is no fixed number of deals or target score that ends the session.&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;&#10;Two other versions of this game exists: Jeu de Carte, which is played in Benin, and Sipa, a game played in Togo. Both share similar rules however.&#10;&#10;Jeu de Carte&#10;&#10;It is played with 31 cards (all the cards from Ace down to Seven except the Ace of Spades).&#10;&#10;Players play their cards in front of them, rather than in a single pile in the centre. A player who is unable to follow suit to a trick plays his card face down.&#10;&#10;The score is 1 point for winning the last trick, or 2 if it is won with a Seven.&#10;&#10;The game is played until an agreed number of points is gained, often 24.&#10;  &#10;Sipa&#10;&#10;The rules are identical to Jeu de Carte with the exception of Scoring:&#10;Whoever wins the fifth and last trick wins the hand and scores:&#10;&#10;6 points if the winning player wins the last three tricks with 7&rsquo;s&#10;    4 points if the winning player wins the last two tricks with 7&rsquo;s&#10;    2 points if the winning card is a 7;&#10;    1 point for winning the last trick with any other card - 8 or higher.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who is the first to score 10 or more points - or the players may agree on some other target score, such as 6, 12 or 24 points.&#10;&#10;"

In his turn each player can move 1 meeple 1 space in any direction. No meeple can jump over another, so they get blocked a lot. The colored spaces on the game board may only be occupied by meeples of the same color. The first player to get all 3 meeples to the finish spaces, wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game was likely published in the 1930s.&#10;&#10;"

The world hovers on the brink of annihilation. Preceded by a devastating orbital attack, a warlike alien race known as the Hydra has besieged the planet, their invasion force carried on enormous drop ships that dwarf city blocks and rain devastation from above. The Hydra&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to eradicate the last survivors of their ancient nemesis, the Ghin, an alien race that has taken refuge on Earth. Humanity is caught in the apocalyptic crossfire. As widespread panic grips the populace, governments topple, economies crumble, and order dissolves. In these desperate days, mankind&rsquo;s only hope lies with the Ghin and one of their most brilliant minds: Dr. Cronos, a being as guilty of atrocities against humanity as those who hunt him.&#10;&#10;LEVEL 7 [INVASION] is a standalone semi-cooperative game of global strategy set in the LEVEL 7 universe that follows the events of LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE], LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE]: Lockdown, and LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL]. As the planet is battered by the Hydra's relentless assault, you'll control Earth's desperation-forged coalitions in an effort to turn back the invasion. But soldiers aren't enough. You and your allies must manage your resources carefully to combat the threats of hysteria, famine, and population loss as well. Endure long enough, and you might buy the time for Dr. Cronos to develop the advanced weaponry required to defeat the invading Hydra. The survival of the human race depends on your next move!&#10;&#10;"
