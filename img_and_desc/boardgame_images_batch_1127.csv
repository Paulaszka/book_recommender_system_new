The racing dice all start off the board on their 1 symbol, which is also wild. On your first turn or two, you'll roll two six-sided dice, choose a die, flip a racing die to the matching number, then place it in the &quot;start&quot; space at the beginning of the lane; you'll then repeat this process with the other die.&#10;&#10;Once you have at least one die in a starting space, on a turn you roll the two six-sided dice, then use each die to either change the face of one of your racing dice or advance a racing die of the matching number. If you create a line of racing dice of the same number, say, two 4s that are adjacent to one another, then you can use a rolled 4 to move both of the racing dice four spaces at the same time. (A 1 counts as all numbers, so it automatically creates a line when adjacent to another racing die.)&#10;&#10;If you land one of your dice on a change space in a lane, you can change an opponent's die to the value of your choice.&#10;&#10;You must land a racing die in the goal space at the end of the lane by exact count. If you would have extra movement, then you move the racing die backwards in the lane until the full value of the die is used. However, if you land a racing die in the penultimate space in a lane, then when you roll that number again, you can push that racing die forward one space onto the goal.&#10;&#10;Get all six of your racing dice onto the goals first, and you win. Alternatively, you can play multiple games, with each player scoring points for the face value of the racing dice in the goals and losing points for dice that didn't make it, with jokers now counting for -10 points.&#10;&#10;"

In most butting games, players try to avoid making choices that match those of other players, but in Romance, you try to match with exactly one other player. The game includes 56 cards with 8 different scenes or situations, and each card has a combination of scenes printed on both sides. The creates 28 possible combinations, and there are two of each combination in the deck. There are also cassette player cards where players will stack their scored cards. If you wish to play a 2-player game, the game includes rules for a dummy player.&#10;&#10;Following the draw each turn, all players choose a card from their public hands and simultaneously play it. Any matching cards with the same situation showing are stacked together, and cards are drawn until there are as many situations on the table as there are players. Players then simultaneously select a situation. If exactly one player choose a situation, the card or cards go in their reserve. If three or more players have a matching choice, those cards remain in the play area. But if exactly two players choose a situation, they will score those cards. Once players have finished these steps, they may flip their entire public hand over so that the other side is now visible or return their hand to the deck and redraw.&#10;&#10;Players place any scored situation cards on the cassette player cards that include both of their player colors. They score any cards from the stack in the center of the table, any visible matching cards from the players' hands, up to one card with a hidden matching side from each player, and any matching cards from their reserve. Each card will be worth one point. Once any cassette player has 10 cards stacked on it or the draw deck runs out of cards, players will add up their points from all cassette players that match their color. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

Collecting a white Copet allows a player to draw and reveal a special White Astrology Card.&#10;&#10;When the box is emptied of Copets, players reveal their cards and score points according to the Copets and Astrology Cards they've collected. For instance a player might score 2 points if they have 2 red Copets on their Tummy Tracker, or they might score 5 points because the player to their right consumed 2 blue Copets.&#10;&#10;"
