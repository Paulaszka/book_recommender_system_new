Every sequence must conform to one of the two rules:&#10;&#10;First rule:&#10;If the sequence has 3 or more numbers, every number is the sum of the previous two numbers - but we only use the last digit of the sum. For example, if the previous two numbers are 6 and 7 then since 6 + 7 = 13 the next number must be 3 (we ignore the first digit, &quot;1&quot;). Other valid Yushino sequences are 875, since 8 + 7 =(1)5; 7291, as 7 + 2 = 9 and 2 + 9 = (1)1, etc.&#10;&#10;Second rule:&#10;If the sequence has 2 numbers, the numbers must differ by 1 - but keep in mind that the numbers repeat, so we go from 0 to 9 and then back to 0 again, which means that 9 is next to 8 but it is also next to 0.

Moreover, the winner will gain interplanetary fame as for the first time in the Grand Bug Races, robobugs from the space station will participate in the next stage of the competition.&#10;&#10;Bug Race is an easy to master but still captivates as a dynamic board game race for 2-4 players  from 8 years old. Each player leads his own bug to victory moving its legs one after another. Of course, legs shouldn&rsquo;t be torn off the body or tangle with each other. When a bug passes all 9 levels of the playing field and crosses the finish line first, its owner wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each bug consists of 7 elements, body and 6 legs, and runs at its own track, divided into sections. There are special notches for the bug&rsquo;s legs, gashed on the each side of the track. Body, that covers three sections, is placed at the track between the legs. &ldquo;Losing&rdquo; legs is permitted: each leg should touch the body at least diagonally all the time. So the bug can not stretch for more than 5 sections.&#10;&#10;When the game begins, players place their bugs at the start positions &ndash; the three first sections of the track. Tracks cross at the middle of the table and connected by the central element with the race aim on it. They are not bonded hard so players don&rsquo;t pull others&rsquo; tracks while moving their own bugs. If needed, in case of lack of free space on the table for example, playing is possible without a center element. And of cause you don&rsquo;t need extra tracks if there are less than 4 players.&#10;&#10;Moving bugs is performed by using special cards. Each of them allows to move 2 or 3 legs, a front left and a middle right, for example. In the beginning of each round players draw two of such cards from the stack. One of them stays at the hand and another one goes to the next player. Then both cards in the hand should be played in any order. Player moves all the stated legs forward if there is a free notch and the leg won&rsquo;t be torn off the body. It&rsquo;s possible to move the bug&rsquo;s body forward as well at any time during the turn if it won&rsquo;t cause a leg loss.&#10;&#10;When everyone finish playing cards &ndash; by verbal understanding cards can be played all at the same time or by turns &ndash; players discard them and draw the new ones. The game is over when at least one bug has passed the finish line by its body, which should be located at the three last track sections. If such a bug is the only one, its owner wins the game. If there are several challengers, the winner is defined by the location of legs.&#10;&#10;Skillful players can play 4 cards instead of 2 during the turn. In that case each player draws 4 cards from the stack, leaves one in the hand and gives three to the next player, chooses one from the derived cards and gives two, and at last gives one and keeps another. By the way, players can choose the convenient design: there is a forest glade with an apple at the one side and a space station with a big red button at the other. Bugs are also two-sided, well-matched to the game field. Of cause, nothing impedes robot-bugs to land on the Earth as well as common insects can visit a space station, it will be even more interesting.&#10;&#10;"

After each move, a player places a new spider into the web (any position, but a different grid that has intersections with the one for the dice). Once all ten spiders have been placed, these can be after a die's movement. Spiders move any distance along the web, unless they are blocked by other spiders.&#10;&#10;Every time a die crosses the web, it is turned up one number (starting with a one).

In addition, the tiles in Limes have a different layout from those in Cities. Together, these changes ensure that Limes has become an entirely new game. (Limes includes two sets of cards, one for each player, but if you combine copies of the game, any number of people can play at the same time.)&#10;&#10;Each player has his own deck of cards. One player shuffles his deck, then places a card at random on the table; each other player takes this same card and places it on the table in his own area. Each player can optionally place one of his figures on this card; once a figure is placed on a card, it cannot be returned to the supply. The second card played (and all subsequent cards) much be placed adjacent to or touching the corner of an already-played card. After each card placement, a player can either place a new figure on this card or move an already-placed figure; a figure can move from one territory to an adjacent territory, e.g., from woods to lake or from grain fields to woods.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as any player has placed 16 cards in a square (4x4 grid).

To place in a region, a player must play a card of that region's color or two cards of the same color as a joker; a player can place at most two pieces in a region on a turn, but only one piece if the region was unoccupied at the start of the turn. One side of the game board &mdash; titled &quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot;, or &quot;Border Disputes&quot;, and made for 3-5 players &mdash; includes house sites that straddle two regions; to claim one of these locations, a player must discard two appropriately-colored cards. The number of emissaries in a region is limited to the number of houses of the same color in that same region.&#10;&#10;When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for that region. Whoever has the most houses in that region scores one point for each house in the region, whoever has the secondmost houses scores one point for each house of the player who has the most, and so on.&#10;&#10;At game end, players also score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions, scoring as many points as the number of emissaries in both regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.

Whoever scores the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot; has one variant. Each player starts with one fortification in addition to his other pieces. Once per game, a player can play two matching cards, then place his fortification on a house site, then top it with a house.
