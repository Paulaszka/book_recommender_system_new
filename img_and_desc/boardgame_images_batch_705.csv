Everyone has their favorite stories to tell, but some stories have been buried over years of neglect. It&rsquo;s time to dust off those old pages and share &lsquo;em. A set of Ninja throwing stars you got for Christmas when you were 12? An excursion into the snowy wastelands in a beat up old car? Tell your stories and other players will interact by hashtagging your story!&#10;&#10;Players take turns telling stories based on prompts as the rest of the players lay down hashtag cards that are relevant to the story. At the end of each story, players receive 2 follower tokens for each hashtag card they played, while the storyteller receives 1 follower token for every hashtag the other players laid during the story.&#10;&#10;"

The cards represent major characters of the poem and include flavor text linked to the original story.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player chooses a faction (Greeks or Trojans, with the inclusion of Gods for 3 players). When playing with 4 players, it becomes a team game.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple and can be taught in minutes. Each turn, a player picks one card from their hand to play and then activates an ability printed on that card (3 choices). There are nine abilities that enable you to manipulate cards in your hand or your opponent&rsquo;s hand, earn victory points, or steal them from an opponent.  The game ends when a player has no more cards in his hand, at which point the surprise factor of the Trojan Horse and Favor of the Gods award a few extra points.&#10;&#10;Clever managing of your hand and wise choice of which ability to trigger can help you triumph over your opponents!&#10;&#10;"

Two complete games are included, BOSTON TO CONCORD and BUNKER HILL. These are fast, tense battles. Card driven, area movement, low counter density, quick play and simple to learn, all make REVOLUTION ROAD a wonderful introduction to the American Revolution and to war-gaming. Its wealth of historical information makes it an ideal teaching tool.&#10;&#10;Although the scale between the games is decidedly different the same rules apply with only slight differences. BOSTON TO CONCORD is a game of maneuver, very chess-like. For the Patriot player it involves alarming the countryside with night-riders, mustering militia and trying to fend off the best infantry in the world. For the British it is playing hide and seek with Patriot Arms caches as he ferrets out Sons of Liberty troublemakers and then tries to make it back to waiting reinforcements as the Patriot forces grow to unmanageable size.&#10;&#10;Bunker Hill is a different animal altogether, a basic slug-fest. The Patriot player faces a growing tide of redcoats who threaten to overwhelm his defense works on every turn. Patriots face disappearing ammunition, flanking, panic and optional rules for alternate British landing sites. As casualties mount historic leaders try desperately to rally their men and bring about the miraculous result reflected upon by British General Henry Clinton when he declared &quot;It was a dear-bought victory; another such would have ruined us.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Known as the Northwest Indian War, Little Turtle's War and Washington's Indian War, this was the first major challenge to President Washington and his army following the conclusion of the Revolutionary War. Spanning from 1785 to 1795, the conflict grew out of a dispute over territorial boundaries following the war, aggravated by settlers flooding across the Ohio to claim Ohio lands then in possession of Native American nations.  The Miami and Shawnee were the principal tribes involved but in time they created a loose alliance with numerous other tribes and together they dealt the U.S. the worst defeat by Indians in the history of our Indian Wars. Washington sent three separate expeditions against them. The first two were handily defeated. The third and final expedition led by General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne ended the conflict with his victory at The Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794.&#10;&#10;This design is similar to King Philip's War. It is point to point movement, using a three dice simultaneous battle system with variable reinforcements on both sides, special action points, alliances and treaties, and frustratingly undependable American militia. The American army operates out of forts, the Indians out of villages. Every two turns both players enter into quartering which in effect resets the board. Destroyed Indian villages are relocated while additional forts and settlements may be built as the game progresses. Indians raiding is a quick and simple mechanism that adds color to the game.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are included - one per expedition with a campaign game that encompasses all three. Low counter density with quick and tense game play.&#10;&#10;"

Coming from a distant planet they do not have peaceful intentions: they are ready to assimilate humanity to make us blue, small and flabby just like them. And since the day was not already awful enough, they want to start right from your city. They are plenty, smart and wicked, just like fag ash, but do not panic: as current lodger of planet Earth, we still have some aces in the hole to play.&#10;&#10;On our side, we have unshakable field agents, tough to the bones and loyal to the cause, although limited when it is time to take action. We can also count on a brilliant group of scientists: if these eggheads could just work together, they might indeed find a way to prevent the imminent invasion... too bad that at the first warning they fled and scatter to the ends of the city! They might be braniacs but definitely miss the guts.&#10;&#10;As part of the resistance, your mission is to coordinate the agents on the field and gather all the scientists before the aliens complete their plan of conquering the city. You shall send orders from your secret headquarter, but be aware: the enemy is looking for you, and if it manages to localize you, it would assimilate and bring you by its side with no hesitation! If that happens you will end up in the perfect situation to undermine all the effort of your former comrades.. the Earthlings!&#10;&#10;COURSE OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The game is divided in three stages that repeat until the end of the game:&#10;1. Event execution (carried out by the architect)&#10;2. Players&lsquo; turns (carried out by all players clockwise)&#10;3. Consolidation (carried out by the architect)&#10;&#10;1.

Players&lsquo; turns&#10;&#10;Each player will be able to command agents in the city or to plan the best strategy to pursue his/her goal. Beware, though: with each action there is the risk of being detected and assimilated by aliens! The alien players may choose to stay hidden until the end of the game or to reveal themselves (without showing their cards)to be in favor with other alien players at the price of exposing themselves to the opposing faction.&#10;&#10;During his/her turn a player may have to perform risky actions that require to draw a given number of assimilation cards. Once drawn, the cards must be kept secret and cannot be revealed to other players. By drawing at least&#10;one Assimilated! card a player becomes an alien. From this very moment on, his/her goal is to let the alien faction win the game! If the assimilation deck is empty the player can still perform his/her actions without drawing any card. An alien player drawing a Human card is still alien. Moreover, drawing two or more Assimilated! Cards does not change the situation.&#10;Once alien, alien forever!&#10;&#10;3. Consolidation&#10;&#10;After all players have completed their turn, the field is prepared for the next stages.&#10;&#10;THE GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to save all the scientists on the map before the invasion is completed. To archive this objective you must keep out the aliens from the rescue. Keep your eyes on your neighbours, they may no longer be the friends you used to trust, not anymore.&#10;&#10;"

Players then take turns bidding according to the rules, until one player's bid is challenged.  The key to the game is using the results of your roll, probability, and your ability to read others to figure out what the best possible bid for that round is (the most number of dice with the highest number on them), and bid it first.  Challenges are resolved by revealing all the dice, as well as the community roll of 3 additional 8-sided dice that Reo adds.&#10;&#10;The most popular version rolls the community dice after a bid is challenged.  This version emphasizes luck a little more, as a player can roll themselves out of a bid gone wrong jam.  The other popular variant rolls the community dice before the bidding, where all players can see the community dice for the &quot;Texas Hold' Em&quot; version.

Those games are Paulus' 6th Army and Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943.&#10;&#10;Paulus' 6th Army is an operational level simulation of the Soviet encirclement operation named &quot;Operation Uranus&quot; and the German escape attempt from Stalingrad from 19th November to 24th December, 1942. This game represents the first significant operational victory of the previously inferior Soviet Red Army over the Wehrmacht. For this reason, the battle of Stalingrad in often referred to as the &quot;turning point&quot; of World War II. But in this game, the German player has more command options than Friedrich Paulus, the German 6th Army commander. So the German player may withdraw from Stalingrad his troops or may defend more effectively than in the historical static situation.&#10;&#10;Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943 is an operational level simulation of the greatest tank battle in history. Beginning on July 5th 1943, strong German forces attempted to cut off the Soviet Kursk salient. Hitler had decided to delay the attack however, until he had sufficient new Panther and Tiger tanks available. During that time, the Soviet forces were reinforced on a scale not seen since World War I, and in addition they knew the details of the German offensive plan. The defenses were deployed on six lines deep. As a result, the German summer offensive named &quot;Zitadelle&quot; (Citadel) was checked, and on 13th July, Hitler informed his generals that Operation Zitadelle was called off.&#10;&#10;The original edition of Paulus' 6th Army and Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943 were published by Six Angles in 2005 and 2009 as issue games of #10 and #13.

Through the rails of several Railways Companies were transported an important portion of the State&acute;s wealth. Many of these goods were transported to the major cities of S&atilde;o Paulo, cities from other States and others ended up down the hill and delivered to the ships from Santos Port, from where they journeyed to remote places. Amongst the carriage of this wealth also traveled over the rails passengers wagons, at a time when distances were tricky to overcome by steam locomotives which slowly crossed valleys and plains. &#10;From a broader view, it is possible to state 8 companies excelled in this endeavor:  Cia. Sorocabana de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Paulista de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Mogiana de Estradas de Ferro, Estrada de Ferro Araraquara, S&atilde;o Paulo Railway, Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, Estrada de Ferro S&atilde;o Paulo-Minas and Estrada de Ferro S&atilde;o Paulo-Rio. Each of these railway companies had their own height but, after the Government&rsquo;s decision to prioritize the road transport, they decayed over time. Nowadays, little remains from many of them but stations, warehouses and rails hidden by the tall grass and oblivion. They were vandalized, destroyed and gone leaving no sign of the passengers, products, wealth and history. Sad closure of a rich and beautiful story.&#10;&#10;Ferrovias de S&atilde;o Paulo brings all railways companies in full operation, where products have to be transported through the cities or sent to Santos Port to meet the needs from other destinations. Players have to move their train compositions, buy and sell products, transport them to several railways of S&atilde;o Paulo State while negotiate with other players through their &ldquo;Agent&rdquo;. The market constantly changes the value of the products so players will have to prove their abilities to explore the best time to buy and sell goods. Additionally, players&rsquo; &ldquo;Agents&rdquo; will have to negotiate with other players &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;, as well with the &ldquo;Negotiator&rdquo;, an independent agent controlled by all players. &#10;Each player start with 1 train composition represented by 1 Locomotive and 1 Train Wagon. Throughout the game, players will be able to improve both their locomotives and train wagons to become more efficient and acquire other train compositions. Finally, players can also buy shares from several Railways Companies, shares from Mining Companies (essential for the Coal Market) and shares from Telegraph Company. &#10;Ferrovias de S&atilde;o Paulo is an economic game where the most successful player claims the victory by holding the biggest amount of money. More than a game, history will come to life as players revive the time where people and history were transported in old wooden train wagons, pulled by steam locomotives which insisted on meeting the challenges of S&atilde;o Paulo territory.&#10;&#10;We wish you all a safe journey.&#10;&#10;"

Displeased by his children, the Pharaoh favors his pets instead. He has decided to alter the lines of succession and will bequeath his entire kingdom either to the feline goddess Bast or to the canine god Anubis, but which one?&#10;&#10;In Heir to the the Pharaoh you and your opponent play as Bast and Anubis, each one vying for the Pharaoh's affection &mdash; and for his throne! Impress the Pharaoh by digging your mighty paws into the sand. Build majestic Shrines, Sun Temples and Obelisks! Use Animal Magic to unleash the power of the gods, who will help you win the favor of the Pharaoh!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game combines intense card play with a spacious and colorfully illustrated game board. It mingles multiple mechanisms, including civilization-building (with tile placement and network building), bidding, set collection, area control, and hand management (with players required to exchange all used cards with their opponent at the end of each round). Seven separate player abilities re-combine each round, depending on the favor of the gods earned that round by each player. For example, earning the favor of the god Ra lets you add a Player Disc to the current Sun for area control around the edges of the board. Ptah allows you to claim the current Monument Card for set collection scoring. Seshat lets you place the current Monument Standee on the board to add to the network of Monuments in play. Geb and Nut let you claim and rotate this Monument Standee and aim it at other Monuments to score points. The Pharaoh lets you secretly contribute cards to the construction of the Pyramid, awarding the greater contributor many points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Over a series of eight rounds, players work to build a Pyramid and a series of smaller monuments to impress the Pharaoh. By performing actions unique to each god, players build monuments and align them to point at other monuments, gaining influence over the Pharaoh as they do so. Once the Pyramid is completed, the player with the most points is declared the Heir to the Pharaoh and wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Once a peaceful settlement of hopeful pilgrims looking to green the desert, the city was disastrously buried by the desert sands and eventually became a destination for all sorts of neer-do-wells looking to escape the eyes of the authorities - and to set up a little empire of their own. In City of Outcasts players are looking to secure the support of the various characters and factions in the city and build up enough support to reclaim Rym for its down-trodden people. In the micro game tradition of games like Love Letter, but with a little more going on, City of Outcasts looks to provide players with a quick, but in-depth micro game experience.&#10;&#10;OVERALL GAMEPLAY: Each player is attempting to play the various powers off each other to assemble allies in a cunning bid to take control of Rym, the City of Outcasts. There are 13 ally cards in the game as well as an Eyes of the People card. One card is dealt to each player face down at the beginning of the game and an equal number of cards are dealt face up on the table as there are players plus one. Each ally cards has an influence number, special ability and a point value. Each player will draw one card from the table clockwise until each player has 2 cards in hand with 1 card remaining. The ally card on the table is the character players are trying to influence. Each player will then simultaneously choose a card from their hand and place it on the table face down. Going clockwise, cards are revealed and if there is an ability with a choice, it must be made upon the reveal. Whoever has the highest revealed influence number after all cards are revealed wins the face up card for the points on the card and takes the Eye of the People card. The Eyes of the People is for the start player of the next round as well as a bonus point at the end of the game. The game ends when there are not enough cards to place on the table and the player with the most points wins and more importantly, usher in a period of justice, peace and prosperity for its down-trodden people.&#10;&#10;There is also included in the game 9 Location Cards and 16 Identity Tokens that can be used for a more epic version of the game. Players assign allies that they have influenced to locations for dominance in Rym. These cards have location points which are used to determine who has the most control within the city. Three location cards are used for each game and the winner is determined after 3 games.&#10;&#10;"

The ultimate goal of the game is easy: race across the map of North America, confront the President, take over the USA, and by doing so gain absolute control of America's forces and therefore the world! The only thing the dictators have to do to avoid eminent repercussions is disarm some nuclear facilities in order to remove the nuclear threat targeting their home countries. Sounds simple, right? The only thing is that dictators aren't used to working together &mdash; and in the end there can be only one Grandmaster &Uuml;ber Dictator of the world!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player receives a dictator passport with a special ability unique to that dictator. The board shows a map of North America and is divided into four &quot;Nuclear Zones&quot;; each zone consists of several states, of which some include a nuclear facility. Every player receives a unique nuclear facility card for each nuclear zone.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns, and each turn consists of any possible combination of the following three actions: draw a Command card, play a Command card and Travel (maximum of once per turn). Players start in Hawaii and race across the map towards the White House in Washington DC. During the game, players can disarm any number of the nuclear facilities they received by rolling a die. In the end, the players have to confront the President at the White House and convince him to give up control of the U.S. by rolling a die. The chance of success drastically increases with each individually disarmed nuclear facility. Players are able to gain bonuses by disarming nuclear facilities of Nuclear Zone 4 (Canada and Mexico). In the meantime, the U.S. &mdash; that is, the game system itself &mdash; fights back by increasing the DEFCON level (with various effects) and with the use of random Founding Father cards which are included in the Command deck.&#10;&#10;"
