The Bear cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. In a round, players attempt to steal from the target bear by playing his cards in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target bear (the top bear card) and plays one of his number cards face up. If he plays a &quot;3&quot; card, it means that the player intends to steal 3 food from the target bear. Next players have two options: 1) look at the bear card just as the first player did and play a number card face up; or 2) play a number/whistle/bear card face down, take a multiplier (x2) card from the pool, and put the multiplier card on his face down number card.&#10;&#10;After all the players played their cards, the Bear card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the Bear is &quot;9&quot; and Josh played &quot;3&quot;, Becky &quot;5&quot;, Lupita &quot;2&quot;, and Samuel &quot;3&quot; with &quot;x2&quot; multiplier on it, Lupita (2), Josh (3), and Samuel (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) food respectively. However, Becky will receive a wound (worth -2 food at the end of the game), since she fought the bear and lost. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the Bear's wrath. Playing the Whistle card will startle the Bear and trigger each other player to be wounded, but the player playing the Whistle card will receive no food this round. Playing the Trap card will keep the player safe against being wounded, but the player playing the card will receive no food this round. The player that received the most amount of food the last round, going clockwise from the starting player, starts the next round.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds,or until all the food is depleted, or until one player receives 5 wounds. The player with the most food at the game end is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Play character cards, watch out for opponents' actions...and may the Force be with you!&#10;&#10;The game is played with only 17 cards. At the beginning of the game, one card is removed at random, then each player draws a card. The game is played in several rounds. Each round represents a stage in the escape plan. At the end of each round, one of the players will get closer to the plan's realization and receive a special token. As soon as someone's got enough tokens, that player will rescue Leia and take her to the Rebel Base.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a card, then plays one of the two cards in hand. Each character card &mdash; Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, Han Solo, Stormtrooper and Boba Fett &mdash; has a special ability. In this version of Love Letter, Boba Fett functions the same as a Stormtrooper, with each having the Guard ability of naming a player's role and eliminating them from the round, but with Boba Fett if you miss on the first shot, you can try again. Miss a second time, though, and you're out of the round yourself!&#10;&#10;The other difference to regular Love Letter is that the Baron ability is split between the two droids, but with R2-D2, the highest value is out of the round.&#10;&#10;"

Historical - 3/6 chance, as I remember.&#10;2. From Budyonny's Stables - 2/6 chance:  What if the Bolshevik traditionalists *had* completely overthrown Tukhachevsky's modern, mobile doctrine *and* equipment, leaving the Red Army  strong in infantry and artillery, and having only weak cavalry/mobile corps, with the one exception of Budyonny's KonArmiya.&#10;3. The Tukhachevsky Twist - 1/6 chance:  What if Tukhachevsky had not been purged and had seen through the reorganization of the Red Army into the mobile, &quot;deep battle&quot; forces he and  Isserman had envisioned?&#10;&#10;Moreover, there are 3 different possible replacement rates, so the German player not only does not know what kind of monster he is attacking, he also doesn't know how strong it is - historical is the maximum.  The easier his opponent is, the more and sooner victory objectives he must achieve.  PRESSURE ... to over-extend?&#10;&#10;"
