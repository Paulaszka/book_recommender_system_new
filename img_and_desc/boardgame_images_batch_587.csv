While the top is spinning the player will drop the six colored wooden balls through the hole in the platform so that they may roll down the sides of the platform and strike the spinning top. The balls will bounce off the top in a lively manner and will fall into holes thus scoring.&#10;&#10;If the top jumps out of the center the SCORE DOES NOT COUNT. The player loses his opportunity to score during that play. Try to spin the top so as to keep it spinning, and keep it in the center circle. A grand total score of 3000 points wins.&#10;&#10;"

There are 112 Color Tiles in a standard deck, along with 20 Corner Tiles.  Each tile in the deck is 1.375&quot; square. Crootle uses four colors, red, green, blue, and yellow.  Each Color tile is divided into quadrants, each quadrant one of the four colors. A Color Tile may have each of its quadrants a different color, or they may be all the same, or a combination. Because there are four colors, there are 256 color combinations possible, 112 of which have been selected to make this standard deck. A Corner Tile is the same size but is solid in color. A set of Corner Tiles consists of one of each of the four colors in Crootle.&#10;&#10;The object of the game of Crootle is to connect two corners of the playing field together. Each game the Corner Tiles are randomly set, and each player randomly selects their path, or rather their two corners to connect. Four players could feasibly be on the same path as each other.&#10;&#10;Through timed turn play, each player draws Color Tiles and matches them side to side, trying to connect, or block their opponents from connecting, their two corners.&#10;&#10;Fun for anyone who sits down to play.  Playing head to head with players of equal ability can prove to make a challenging game.  Test playing has found audiences in children 7+, adult party games, senior players, and even some autistic and other mentally challenged persons have enjoyed the task of connecting Color Tiles.&#10;&#10;"

A vacant space of at least five squares must be left after placing a piece on the board.&#10;2.

Associated with these is a deck of prosperity cards that match the regions.  Each player is dealt a couple cards; in addition some cards are dealt face up in common.  As play proceeds, players try to acquire locations they think will be prosperous.  They deduce this based on the cards they can see, plus the actions of other players.  At the end of a number of turns, all prosperity cards are revealed and regions are ranked based on number of matching cards.  Factors within those regions are then increased or decreased based on this ranking.  This sequence is repeated several times, after which the game ends.&#10;&#10;Player actions include drawing influence cards, expanding factors, building ports and fleets, and movement.  At times, open locations will be taken over by a player.  At other times a hostile takeover will be necessary, in which case the right influence and a nearby fleet will make all the difference.&#10;&#10;The goal is simple: to have the most factors on the board at game end.&#10;&#10;"

A number of Insurgent factions have sprung up hoping to undermine the government and send the country into a state of anarchy, in the belief they stand to gain power or wealth in the coming lawlessness.&#10;&#10;Choose your side: Become one of three insurgent factions bent on sowing chaos by launching ever greater terror events, or make one last stand on behalf of the United States. If you can stand firm and keep this country from descending into anarchy you will restore the people's faith in its government and keep the American dream alive.&quot;&#10;&#10;Threat Level Red is a game for 4 players where three players play the role of insurgent factions attacking from within the united states, and one player takes on the role of the hobbled, fading federal government.&#10;&#10;As an insurgent faction your goal is to increase the anarchy level in the US to 20 by launching insurgent events. Each turn begins with a hidden token deployment phase where you must secretly plant sleeper cell and insurgent event tokens in major cities across the country. Once all the insurgent player's plans are set players then take turns revealing one secret token at time. Each sleeper cell token you activate increases the action points available to you to play your event cards, but also gives the US player more information about where you are planning your next event. Do you carry out small safer operations to draw additional event cards, cell tokens, and earn resources, or do you try to go all out and launch a major, but risky offensive by playing one of your major event cards? Once your organization has grown strong enough anything is possible- from a simple bomb threat, to hacking the nation's closed circuit TV network, or for the most powerful and violent factions building the dreaded suitcase nuke, but if the american player can deduce where your next event is taking place you stand to lose everything.&#10;&#10;As the government player you seek to foil as many insurgent events as possible. If you can foil 12 insurgent events, or survive 5 game turns without the anarchy level rising to 20 points you are victorious. Unfortunately you are understaffed and nearly out of resources to face the burgeoning threats facing the nation. You begin the game with a small number of agent units that you must allocate between the major geographic &quot;zones&quot; of the united states. At the start of each turn you gain a small number of reinforcements: additional agent units and counterplot cards. Your counterplot cards will let you set up wiretaps, border patrols, undercover agents. Each time it is your turn you may send up to one agent token per &quot;zone&quot; to investigate a face down enemy token. If you correctly select a location of an insurgent event that event is discarded and you gain 1 stability point, but if the hidden token you reveal turns out to be an enemy sleeper cell the agent will most likely be lost in the ensuing gunfight. Since you have far fewer agents then your enemies have sleeper cells if you were to send your agents in to investigate every hint of insurgent activity you would soon be out of agents and quickly overrun. So instead, watch closely, let the insurgents overextend, give them enough rope to hang themselves before making your move. If you wait too long you risk letting another terror attack slip through your fingers, but if you strike at the right time even a small handful of well-trained agents can topple these immense terror networks.&#10;&#10;"

Zoom!&#10;&#10;Players start with six cards each, which are used to spell words. The first person to spell BANG gets a 10 point bonus. Once this occurs, when someone spells ZOOM, they get a 10 point bonus and the game ends. Points are scored for each letter used in words. The winner is the player with the most points.&#10;&#10;Hooey&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ve got to be sharp. You&rsquo;ve got to be shifty. Announce which cards you&rsquo;re laying face down. Whether you tell the truth is up to you. Any player can then question your honesty. If they&rsquo;re right - you get the pile, if they&rsquo;re wrong - they do! First player to get rid of all their cards wins.&#10;&#10;Rats!&#10;&#10;Kid's game of pure luck. Cards are dealt face down to all players. Turn up cards in rotation and put them in the center; if you turn up a Big Fat Rat (rather than a Random Rat), you get all the cards in the center, unless the next player can also turn up a BFR. Object is to collect all the cards.&#10;&#10;Royal Fluster&#10;&#10;Players are dealt five cards from a modified standard deck and attempt to put together a Royal Flush by drawing and discarding cards.

The first player to make a royal flush wins the game.&#10;&#10;Spit!&#10;&#10;Each player deals 4 stacks with 7 down and the 8th card up. Play with only one hand (right, unless left-handed). At the same time, all players turn one card from the remaining deck face up in the center to start N piles. All may add to any pile. Ignore suits and colors. Build up or down, and change directions if you want: 5-6-7-6-7-6-7-8-9, etc. Numbers make a complete circle: 10-J-Q-K-A-2-3-4. Play only one card at a time from the top of of a stack onto a center pile; do not move cards sideways to create sequences on own stacks. Keep playing until ALL have used all their card piles.&#10;&#10;Three Throws&#10;&#10;This game has a theme of rock-scissors-paper. It is played in two different rounds. In the first round, players take turns turning up cards on a face-down tableau. If they turn up a set of winners, these cards are taken into hand. When all of the card possible are taken, the second round begins, which is essentially a game of war between players.&#10;&#10;"
