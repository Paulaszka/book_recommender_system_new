The battle for our country is on!&#10;&#10;Publisher&#226;&#128;&#153;s product page&#10;&#10;The core of the game is 24 presidents, divided up evenly among the players. At the beginning of the game, you select a Big Bad that&rsquo;s trying to destroy America. Every turn, you draw five cards out of your deck and play them. Each president has a presidential power based on that president&rsquo;s actual strengths (such as popularity, party building or policy leadership). Presidents can also join forces to attack villains together, or recruit new cards into your deck. You can add to your deck cards that represent support from other presidents (hello, Millard Fillmore!), constitutional provisions that give powers to the presidency, and other forces from American history. These support cards interact with keywords on your presidents and other game factors, giving you tactical choices.&#10;&#10;The players use their attacks to capture 12 villains from American history. Then it&rsquo;s time for the Final Showdown with the Big Bad that&rsquo;s trying to destroy America, represented by a set of threat cards. The rules for the Final Showdown are different for each Big Bad &ndash; fighting off a pandemic and fighting off monsters require different tactics! If the Big Bad defeats your presidents, it wins; if you defeat it first, the player with the most captured villains and Big Bad threat cards wins. So there&rsquo;s pressure to be capturing villains for the whole game, but victory still hangs on that Final Showdown.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The Camper players try to survive the Psychopath&rsquo;s attacks and hope for rescue using the Actions, Items, Allies and Skills available in their deck of cards. If the Psychopath manages to kill all the Campers, he wins the game! However, if at least one Camper survives or manages to become rescued, the Campers win!

At the start of each round all players secretly select a card from their hand to be played as their starting card and place it face down on the table. When all players have done so, cards are then revealed to show the location each players is at: the Lake, the Cabin, the Shed, or the Woods.

Campers can play Allies, Skills, Items and Actions to bolster their defense, attempt to Escape or become Rescued, and to thwart the attacks made by the Psychopath. The Psychopath will play Items and Actions to cause Wounds to the Campers in order to weaken or kill them. After players in a Struggle have played all the cards they wish, Struggles are resolved with Campers losing cards from their hand of cards equal to the number of Wounds they suffered. If a Camper suffers more Wounds than the cards in their hand, they are killed! The Psychopath suffers his Wounds by discarding that number of cards from the top of his deck of cards.

Place a new piece of your color on the board in a valid position. Valid positions are the ones that are unoccupied on the board, and not encircled by the opponents&rsquo; pieces. The board is divided in small triangle slots. The piece you place, must take up the total area of the triangles they cover.&#10;&#10;2.

Attack an opponent&rsquo;s piece (stealing a piece). This action allows you to steal any one of the opponents' pieces which is already on the board: flip it to your color side and place it outside the board with the rest of your pieces. Then you are obliged to cover that space with at least two of your own pieces which equal in size to the area of the piece you took.&#10;&#10;4. You can pass your turn.

Even though your goal is to survive and fight off the war cards, it doesn't mean you can't nuke the player sitting next to you and destroy half their hand.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Players take turns by drawing and playing cards until a WAR card is drawn from the deck. Once a WAR card is drawn, that player must defeat that WAR card. Be diplomatic to avoid the WAR, try to fight or be destroyed.&#10;&#10;Taking your turn:&#10;Gather all your cards into your hand and look at them. Do one of the following:&#10;1. Draw from the draw pile. If it is a WAR card you can either play Diplomacy card and avoid the WAR or go to WAR and use your troops to defeat the WAR card. You must have the same or greater attack value (attack values are on troop cards) to win the WAR.

It was planned by Field Marshal Montgomery as combined land - airborne operation. The airborne operation was undertaken by the First Allied Airborne Army with the land operation by XXX Corps of the British Second Army.&#10;&#10;The operation's objective was to create a 103 km long corridor into Germany with a bridgehead over the River Rhine, creating an Allied invasion route into northern Germany. This was to be achieved by seizing a series of nine bridges with airborne forces, with land forces swiftly following over the bridges. Despite this ambitious plans, operation turned out to be a fiasco.&#10;&#10;Game covers the entire Market Garden operation. It comes with four scenarios, picturing the parts of the battle and the whole battle itself. It uses battalion scale.&#10;&#10;&quot;Market Garden&quot; uses WB-95 system, with some modifications that were necessary due to a scale change.&#10;&#10;"

The player with the most points when the flow of customers runs out is the winner.&#10;&#10;Setup   &#10;Each player chooses one diner board and places it in front of them.&#10;&#10;Sort and place the food tiles and penalty tokens into each slot of the kitchen caddy.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the customer order cards. Based on the amount of players, remove the number of cards needed and place the remaining cards back in the box (see chart at right).&#10;&#10;The first person to shout out what they ate for breakfast will deal first. Give them the chef&rsquo;s spoon and cards.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;This game is played in rounds. Each round consists  of the following actions:&#10;1. Dealer assigns customer order cards.&#10;2. All players select food tiles.&#10;3. All players cook food items.&#10;4. All players serve their customers, if they are able.&#10;&#10;After all four actions are completed, the chef&rsquo;s spoon and the customer order deck are passed clockwise to the next player, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;1. Assigning Customers&#10;The player with the chef&rsquo;s spoon is the dealer for each round. The dealer draws customer order cards equal to the number of players. The dealer then assigns one customer order to each player, including themselves. You can keep a more difficult card with the higher risk and point value for yourself or assign it to an opponent in hopes of giving them more than they can handle. All players then place their customer order cards on an empty table space within the Orders section of their diner board. In later rounds, if all the table spaces on a player&rsquo;s diner board are full, they must immediately serve one of their current customers, even if that order will be incomplete, before receiving a new customer order card for that round.&#10;&#10;2. Selecting Food Tiles &#10;Starting with the dealer, players take turns in clockwise order selecting food tiles from the kitchen caddy based on their orders and cooking times. Each player may take up to a total of seven food tiles, from up to three different food types. This is the maximum; you are not required to select more food tiles than you want or need. Take your selected food tiles, and place them in a stack on their corresponding spaces in the Prep column of your diner board.&#10;&#10;3. Cooking Food&#10;All players cook their food at the same time. When everyone is ready, the dealer for the round announces, &ldquo;Cook time!&rdquo; Now, starting with the top row and working your way down, move all food tiles on your diner boards one space to the right. Keep each round&rsquo;s stack of tiles together as they move across the board. Some food types do not need to stop in each column. When a tile reaches a space with an arrow, slide it across the arrow until it reaches the column indicated. Once food items are in the Ready to Serve spaces, they can be used to serve any combination of orders (see Serving Customers section).Any unserved food in the final column of the Ready to Serve section will be moved into the Trash column during cook time.&#10;&#10;4. Serving Customers&#10;Players may serve their customers during actions 1 or 4 using any food tiles that are in the Ready to Serve area. When you are ready to serve a customer&rsquo;s order, move the food tiles from your Ready to Serve area and place them on the corresponding spaces of the customer order card to check that you have the correct food items.&#10;&#10;End of Game &#10;Complete the round in which the last customer order cards have been assigned. Then the game enters the final phase. Still taking turns going clockwise, each player has the chance to select one last set of food tiles to place on their diner board. Cooking then occurs as normal. The final phase then continues with all players cooking their food and serving their remaining customer orders (repeating  actions 3 and 4). The game ends once all customer order cards are removed and all food tiles have been served or moved into the Trash column.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;Players total the scores from their served customer order cards and subtract any penalty tokens received to determine their final scores. The player with the most points wins. In the case of a tie, the player with the fewest penalty tokens wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the five highest-point customer order cards wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

If you look, you will see rectangles, squares, cones, triangles, circles, straight lines and curved lines in everything around you. The ability to identify basic shapes and how they relate to each other is the foundation for understanding and solving more complex geometrical and patterning problems.&#10;&#10;Asymbol provides you with 47 unique shapes to pick from as you assemble things, beings, places and events/activities to challenge others to guess your vision!&#10;&#10;Object of the Game&#10;Players take turns being an Asymbler (builder) by drawing a card, choosing one of the two subjects and using the various shaped pieces to create their subject. At the same time, the other players try to guess what is being created. The correct guesser and the Asymbler each earn a point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Place all 47 Asymbol pieces in the middle of the play area.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the card deck, and place it facedown next to the Asymbol pieces, creating a draw pile.&#10;&#10;Give each player a pass token to be placed near them.&#10;&#10;Hand the scorepad and pencil to a player to keep score for each round.&#10;&#10;When starting the game, determine how many rounds to play before the game ends. A round ends when each player has had the chance to be the Asymbler.&#10;&#10;The first player to name a shape starts as the first Asymbler.&#10;&#10;Make sure the Asymbler can reach the pieces and has enough space in front of them to build.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;On your turn as the Asymbler, draw the top card from the deck, keeping it hidden from the other players, and choose one of its two subjects.&#10;&#10;Pass Token&#10;If both subjects are unfamiliar or too challenging, you may use your pass token to discard your current card and draw a new one from the draw pile. After using the token, return it to the box. Each player has only one opportunity to use their token as an Asymbler, so choose wisely.&#10;&#10;Categories&#10;When you are ready to start, announce the category of your chosen subject.  Only share the category and not the subject you are going to create.&#10;&#10;Assembling and Guessing&#10;To create your subject, use any number of the Asymbol pieces from the play area. You can create with pieces lying flat or by building vertically. Moving the pieces is allowed to show motion and help portray your subject. You may not speak while you build, but making sound effects is allowed. You may use body language (nods and hand gestures) to indicate if a player&rsquo;s guess is on the right track or not. Once you begin to assemble, all the other players can start guessing. They guess at the same time and can continue to make guesses until someone&rsquo;s guess is correct. There is no time limit, but you may end your turn if you feel like no one can correctly guess the subject. Otherwise, the turn ends after a correct guess, and play continues clockwise.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;The first player to correctly guess the subject gets a point. If multiple players guess correctly at the same time, they all get a point. As Asymbler, you also receive a point for successfully creating a subject that another player could recognize. If there are no correct guesses and you choose to end your turn, then no one scores any points that turn.  Return all the pieces you used to the play area, and place your card in the discard pile. Play continues clockwise with the next player becoming the Asymbler, drawing a new card, announcing a category and creating their subject with the pieces.&#10;&#10;End of Game &#10;After the agreed upon number of rounds has been completed, the player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the players share the victory.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
