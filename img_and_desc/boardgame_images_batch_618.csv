A betting card is numbered from 1 to 7, with two copies of each card.&#10;&#10;Beginning with the starting player, each player lays one of the seven critter cards on the table, adding it to the foremost or hindmost position. At the end of the initial set up, the seventh critter card is flipped, marking it as the &quot;dark horse&quot; in the race. On a player's turn, they must play an action card and execute its effect, e.g., moving the fourth critter card forward or backward two spaces, moving the number 6 critter card forward or backward one space, or exchanging one of your betting cards with an unused betting card.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the player can pick up one of the three &quot;dark horse&quot; tokens, which is worth 5 points if the &quot;dark horse&quot; ends the race in the top three positions; if not, that token is worth -3 points.&#10;&#10;After five turns, each player reveals their two betting cards and receives points according to the matching critter card's position: 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point(s) for first through seventh place. After accounting for the dark horse tokens, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Minuscule was first released under the title Dark Horse with a horse-racing theme.&#10;&#10;"

The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Vitoria, fought on June 21, 1813, was one of the most decisive battles of the Peninsular War. It was the last major battle between the allied British, Portuguese and Spanish forces and the French armies, and opened the way for the invasion of France. It opposed 60,000 French soldiers commanded by King Joseph to 80,000 allies superbly trained and equipped attacking on three sides. Looking like a one-sided battle, things are far from obvious for the Allies and many what-ifs make the situation very interesting.&#10;&#10;Oca&ntilde;a, fought on 19 November 1809 was a major Spanish defeat that ended any chance of success in the Spanish Junta&rsquo;s autumn campaign of 1809. The largest Spanish army under general Areizaga, more than 55,000 men, moved toward Madrid but allowed Marshal Soult and King Joseph to concentrate around 30,000 men. A brutal clash occurred at Oca&ntilde;a, and a French cavalry movement on the flank rolled the Spanish line.&#10;&#10;Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a turning point in 1812.  The battle saw the Anglo-Portuguese army under the Duke of Wellington defeat Marshal Marmont's French forces among the hills around Arapiles, south of Salamanca. Both armies, 50,000 men each, have been marching and countermarching for days trying to outflank each other. Wellington eventually caught the French in an over-extended position and struck at the center. A very well balanced battle, where a better concentration gave the advantage to Wellington.&#10;&#10;Sorauren is the last battle of the counteroffensive by Soult&rsquo;s reorganized army of Spain in July 1813. It was part of a series of engagements in late July 1813 called the Battle of the Pyrenees in which a combined British and Portuguese force under Sir Arthur Wellesley held off Marshal Soult's French forces attempting to relieve Pamplona. Attacking a thin red line in a very good defensive position, the French were eventually pushed back, but the battle could have turned very differently.&#10;&#10;(source: Legion Games website)&#10;&#10;"
