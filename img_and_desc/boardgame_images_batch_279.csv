Two teams sit in such a way that they are in between two of their opponents and facing everyone.  The game is much like Hot Potato; a song and artist appears on the screen of the handheld device.  The player currently holding it must get one of their teammates to correctly guess the name of the song.  They must do this without saying any part of a word on the screen, rhyming any parts of those words, or saying the first letter of any of those words.  When a teammate guesses correctly, the device is passed to the left for the other team to do the same.  The round ends when an internal timer runs out and a buzzer sounds.  The team not holding the device at that time scores a point.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play, and scoring is different in each.  The first is similar to classic Catch Phrase.  However, if you wish to incorporate singing into the game, the other version adds an extra point for any clue that is sung, if the team guesses correctly.&#10;&#10;The game has 9 categories to choose from each round: Pop Mix, 70s, 80s 90s, 2000s, Classic Rock, Hip Hop/R&amp;B, Country, Oldies.&#10;&#10;The game requires 3 AAA batteries, not included.&#10;&#10;"

The first is an array of squares representing one, two or three half-crates of tea in four different varieties (colors).  Each player has a marker which moves about in the array, picking up tea at the rate of one square per turn.  There are simple rules governing movement in this array and the players compete for the desirable squares.&#10;&#10;Eventually, several times per game, each player has enough squares of a single color to fit them together so that the half-crates all make whole crates.  Now he can make a tea shipment.  This pays off in victory points in three different ways.  First, there is a &quot;demand&quot; award of up to 6 VP depending on how long it has been since anyone shipped this variety.  Second, if the shipment was of at least four crates, there is a flat bonus of 1 VP per crate.&#10;&#10;Third and most pivotally, there are VP that will be awarded at the beginning of the player's next and subsequent turns.  Each tea shipment is represented with cubes of the player's color (not the tea variety color) on a sort of barge.  The new shipment of tea is always placed, in the other of the two main board areas, at the top of a column of all the recent shipments (the number of total shipments varying with the number of players in the game), so that as more shipments are made, the old shipments drift farther down the column and eventually out of play.  At the beginning of your turn, you look to see where your shipments are in this column, and they pay out VP with better multipliers the higher they still are in the column.  This constitutes the driving force of the game, as nobody else wants to see your shipment at the top of the column for several turns in a row.  Players thus have an incentive to make a shipment even if they haven't yet assembled a large number of crates.&#10;&#10;It's a race to 100 points.  A runaway leader can easily take over if the rest of the table is not vigilant, so the best games of Darjeeling are those among vigilant players.&#10;&#10;"
