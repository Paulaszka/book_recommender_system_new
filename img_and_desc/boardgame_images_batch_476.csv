The game combines the jump capture and promotion found in games in the Checkers family, with the win conditions found in games in the Tafl family, with modifications made to both families of abstract strategy games, to work on an 8x4 board.&#10;&#10;From the Turkish Checkers family comes orthogonal sliding and jumping, and promotion of pieces for the Defending side.

In it, players attempt to reduce 6 dice that are rolled to a single die on the board, with value of 6 on top.  As players move dice, they reduce in value.  As players merge dice, the new dice on the space merged equals the sum of the two dice merging.  Players are not permitted to combine dice to a value greater than six, and each die is permitted to only move in a line, one or more spaces.&#10;&#10;Quick rules:&#10;&#10;     Roll the six dice, and then place them on the board so they get reduced to a single die with a six on it.&#10;     As a die moves into another die, the value of the die moved into is increased by the current value of the die moving, and the die moving is removed from the board.&#10;     A single move for a die consists of moving in a straight line vertically, horizontally or diagonally, like a queen in chess.  For each empty space a die moves into, it decreases its value by 1.  A die may not be reduced to less than one doing this.&#10;     Each die can perform, at most, one move per puzzle.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Both games were developed in parallel over a thirty-year period. Why is the game set in 2020? A few soccer rules changed by that year, making the game more fluid.&#10;&#10;While StreetSoccer simulates soccer with five players on a side on a small square, Champions 2020 simulates stadium soccer, so the field is bigger. As coach you select 11 players as a starting line-up (goalie, defenders, midfielders, forwards), while the rest of your team starts in the dug-out for possible substitutes (after warming up).&#10;&#10;Your professional soccer players are more skilled than street soccer players, which leads to spectacular stadium matches. Players can try to hit passing balls, which can lead to throw-ins, corner-kicks and goalie-kicks. As skilled team players, your players can anticipate on passes. Your goalie is skilled, too. With good positioning he has the best save chances, which depends on the speed of the shot and the distance to the ball. A rebound is possible, but a better save is catching the ball in his hands.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the players are &quot;skilled&quot; in causing fouls (or &quot;schwalbes&quot;), too. As soccer coach, you can't always control your players &ndash; and that leads to free kicks, penalty kicks, yellow/red cards and injuries.&#10;&#10;For tournaments the yellow/red cards, injuries, extra time, penalty kicks and stats make the soccer simulation complete.&#10;&#10;"

If a piece has been pushed/moved off the board or has already been scored the player gets one chance to re-roll that die.

Each card shows an aggression number (ranging from 0 to 3) which represents the attacks you have received while travelling.&#10;Sum the aggression numbers  of each card you draw to get an Attack value which represents the amount of wounds you have sustained this turn.&#10;At any time, if the total attack value is higher than Frodo's wounds, the player immediately loses the game.&#10;&#10;This means that the Attack value will be the sum of all aggression numbers of cards drawn this turn.&#10;&#10;Example: if the player chooses directions with a high destination number, which makes him move faster, he will finish the mission within the preset time of 25 days/turns, but will also increase the chances of getting damaged and killed.&#10;&#10;At any time, but before drawing cards from the quest deck, you can use the RING which will turn Frodo invisible and, therefore, immune to all the attacks received (consider all aggression numbers as 0). BUT doing so will also bring the Witch King closer to you. Any time you use the Ring, put a token on the the Witch King Track on the play mat.&#10;The first time you use the ring, put a token on the Ring symbol on the play mat: this is a reminder that the ring has been used at least once.&#10;&#10;While drawing or before drawing (depending on the item), the player will have the chance to use one item he is equipped with.&#10;The player can use only one item per turn.&#10;&#10;C.  Card Effects can be good or bad, depending on the card.&#10;A player resolves the card effects ONLY of the last drawn card of the turn. Unless otherwise stated, the ONLY thing the player should take into account while drawing the cards is the aggression number.&#10;&#10;Example: if the player chooses a direction with a destination number 3, he draws (one at a time) 3 cards, adding the Aggression Numbers of all 3 cards and resolving ONLY the effects of the 3rd card.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player will have many choices to make, from deciding if he wants to rest (and recover his wounds), to which direction to go; from using potions or other items (like the Ring), to going looking for Aragorn to help him against the Witch King.&#10;&#10;Main game mechanic: push your luck.&#10;&#10;"

Problem is that they both act as trumps, so getting rid of spades is hard, but there are special rules for Jacks and Queens in other suits that help to make that easier. When all cards are played, couples read their hearts and spades. Each heart is 2 points, each spade is -2 points, each Jack and Queen is extra 2 points (whatever suit) and each Ace is a free drink card (still a party game). Winner is the couple with the most points.&#10;In 4 couple game, game is played the same, but the winning conditions are different. Couples now only score how many cards they have - each red 2 points, each black -2 points. Rest is the same with the exception that 0 is the worst result. That means the further you are from the 0 the higher your score is.&#10;&#10;Couples game:&#10;Uses the special trivia game cards. This is played in circles, couples sitting against each other. When the times comes to a player, he/she pulls a cards and ask one question from his partner about herself/himself. Partner then writes down an answer along side with the question asker. When the answer are more or less the same, they score one point (a kiss or a hug). Game lasts 10 rounds. Couple with more points (kisses) wins the game.&#10;&#10;Other 4 are drinking games (one seems to be a sex game) where there is no actual winners or scoring of any kind. Like they say in the rules - all players are winners with these games.&#10;&#10;"

Hull Breach! features a unique science fiction world with many of your favorite elements of each.&#10;&#10; From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;Hull Breach! is a tactical, operational, and strategic space-combat and logistics card game for two or more players.&#10;&#10;Each player has his or her own deck of cards consisting of a Station, ships, modules, Marines, technological breakthroughs, events, and tactics. Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.&#10;&#10; Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).&#10;&#10;The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;"
