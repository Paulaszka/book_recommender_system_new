The publisher gives an alternate name &mdash; &quot;Samurai-Dori &#239;&#189;&#158;Wings of Bushido&#239;&#189;&#158;&quot; &mdash; to reflect the activity. The first edition was published in 2016 in Japanese but a new edition is being prepared for SPIEL '17, with English, German and French rules. The game includes printed cubes which the players arrange in more or less challenging targets. It's important that players are respectful, and they must bow before making their shots.&#10;&#10;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#232;&#136;&#136; (T&#197;&#141;senky&#197;&#141;), created in Japan during the Edo period, is a traditional target practice game in which you have to throw a folding fan at a target placed on a stand and knock it down. Samurai Dori has simpler rules than T&#197;&#141;senky&#197;&#141;. We have arranged the gameplay to make it easier for anyone to play. The cubes and targets represent animals, and folding fans are hunting birds. You compete to see who can hunt the most animals. You can play eight different scenarios depending on how you arrange the three cubes. Even though it is a simple game, it has a deep feel to it, which even children and older people can enjoy.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#177;&#159;&#230;&#136;&#184;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#231;&#181;&#177;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#232;&#136;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#229;&#176;&#132;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#190;&#141;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#232;&#136;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#229;&#141;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#139;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#139;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;3&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#174;&#177;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#133;&#168;8&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#165;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#183;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#228;&#190;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#229;&#175;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Jeor Mormont wishes to promote one who can improve the infrastructure of the Gift, the bountiful and undeveloped area south of the Wall bestowed to the Watch by the Starks thousands of years ago. Drawing sustenance from the unforgiving landscape of the north offers enough challenges, but whomever takes up this task must also man and defend the Wall against the onslaught of Wildlings fighting their way into Westeros. Many brothers now compete to build, defend, and do what they can to protect Westeros, but only one shall rise above their brothers to become the new Lord Commander. But be wary &mdash; the north holds many dangers, and winter is coming.&#10;&#10;A Game of Thrones Catan: Brotherhood of the Watch is based on the classic Settlers of Catan base game. In this game, each area in the Gift supplies one of five resources: lumber, brick, wool, grain, and ore. The barren Ice Fields, however, produce nothing. Players take on the role of Brothers of the Night's Watch and use these resources to strengthen their hold on the north by building roads, settlements, and keeps; recruiting guards for their patrol; or buying development cards. Each of these acts bring players increased power and recognition through the awarding of victory points. The objective will be familiar to players of the original Catan; the first player to achieve ten victory points wins the game and becomes the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.&#10;&#10;But this is not as easy as it sounds as the area surrounding the Gift can be treacherous. Wildings from north of the Wall have crossed over and follow their own rules of honor, which often conflict with the laws of Westeros. One of their ranks, Tormund Giantsbane, does not respect the Watch's claim to the land as he moves throughout the Gift, robbing resources from the Brothers sent to provide for their Order. While Tormund runs amok south of the Wall, Wildling forces gather in the Frostfangs, awaiting an opportune moment of weakness to breach the Watch's defenses and spread throughout the fruitful lands of Westeros. In addition to building within the Gift, players must strategically balance their resources to defend the Realm from Wildling raiders.&#10;&#10;Each player may recruit up to seven brothers from the prisons of Westeros to don their specific color and man their section of the Wall. When the Wildings attack, each player must use their guards to fend off the onslaught. If there are more guards than Wildings, the Wall stands. If there are not, the Wildings invade the Gift and pillage the settlements and keeps therein. Yet loyalty only goes so far &mdash; guards are useless defending the Wall from Climbers who slip past them, and if they encounter a Giant, at least one guard is bound to desert his post.&#10;&#10;Each player also has a hero to aide in their toil, based on the order of play. The first player will utilize the talents of the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont, while the second player will enjoy the company of Samwell Tarly, the third will work with Bowen Marsh, and the fourth will employ the services of Master Builder Othell Yarwyck. Each hero offers a unique ability to each player which they can use up to twice during the game. Once a hero's ability has been used, players have a choice to keep that hero or choose another of the eleven heroes to aide them. Players should factor the heroes' abilities into their strategy to quickly earn victory points and gain renown within the Watch.&#10;&#10;The Wildling invasion marks the truest test of the Brothers of the Watch and your own competency as a commander. A failure at the Wall has a devastating impact on the Gift, even if it does not destroy the players. A Game of Throne Catan: Brotherhood of the Watch has two forms of victory, though one may feel hollower than the other. Victory occurs when a player has both improved the infrastructure of the Gift and successfully kept it safe from invaders. This is shown when a player has achieved ten victory points by any combination of building keeps, roads, and settlements; hiring three or more guards to keep the Wall safe; and buying development cards to increase their prestige, all while safeguarding the Gift.&#10;&#10;However, if the Wildlings breach the wall three times throughout the game, an alternate victory takes place. If this occurs, the game ends immediately as the Brotherhood of the Night's Watch can no longer delay their decision. The player commanding the most guards holding their posts on the Wall gains the title of Lord Commander and wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

All foes have damage and strength ratings. They may also have traits that will interact with other cards.&#10;&#10;Counters are used to keep track of Life Points, Doom Points and Ammunition. Each player starts with 19 + 1D6 Life Points and  2D6 Doom Points.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of turns with each turn comprising 6 phases.&#10;&#10;1.   Doom Phase&#10;-     Lay out 3X cards where X is the number of players.  These are the doom cards.&#10;&#10;2.   Leader Phase&#10;-     Determine the leader for this phase. The player with the least life is the leader. If tied for least life, the player with the least Doom Points goes first.&#10;&#10;3.   Tactics Phase&#10;-     Starting with the Leader, and going clockwise, each player picks 1 of the doom cards laid out in Doom Phase. If it is an Aid card place it in front of yourself. If it is a Foe card place it in front of an opponent. If it is a Location card, place it in front of yourself or an opponent. If a player gets a Location card, he must discard any other location card he may already have in play. &#10;-    Continue going around until all doom cards are assigned.&#10;&#10;4.   Resolution Phase&#10;-     Start with the leader and go clockwise. &#10;-     Each location has a foe limit. The player discards foes in front of him in excess of the foe limit. &#10;-     Discard 1 or more ammo tokens, equipment, and action cards to defeat a foe with a strength equal to less than the force of the cards discarded. &#10;-    Gain Doom Points equal to the damage rating of defeated foes. Discard defeated foes.&#10;&#10;5.   Damage Phase&#10;-     Each foe in front of you does damage to you equal to its damage rating (damage received corresponds to an equal loss of life points)&#10;&#10;6.   End Phase&#10;-     At end of turn a player may have a max of 6 aid cards in front of him.  Discard excess. &#10;-    If you did not take damage in damage phase, heal 2 life points.&#10;&#10;The first player to gain 50+ Doom Points and to have killed at least 1 Boss is the winner.  Lose all your life points and you are out of the game. If only one player remains, he wins.&#10;&#10;"

This population, also known as the Huron Nation, lived in the Great Lakes region, together with the tribes who formed the Iroquois Confederacy, and many others. In this game, you will explore the traditions and everyday life of these tribes during the 1756&ndash;1763 period, when the Seven Years&rsquo; War between the French and the English took place in these territories.&#10;&#10;But this white man&rsquo;s war is only a marginal aspect of the game; the focus is on life in the native villages, fields, and forests. In this game, you won&rsquo;t find the traditional tipis, which were used by southwestern tribes who moved their camps to follow the bison herds. The natives of the Great Lakes were more sedentary, living in longhouses. The women farmed beans, corn, and pumpkins, while the men hunted beavers in the forests, mainly to sell their pelts as leather.&#10;&#10;In Wendake, you step into the shoes of the chief of a Native American tribe. You will have to manage the most important aspects of your tribe&rsquo;s daily existence, thereby earning points on the Economic, Military, Ritual, and Mask tracks. The core of the game is the action selection mechanism: you will have the opportunity to choose better and better actions over 7 years (i.e., rounds), and the winner will be the chief who finds the best combinations of actions and uses them to lead their tribe to prosperity!&#10;&#10;"

Management has asked you to stick around and put together a dark match to keep the fans in their seats. There isn't enough time to choreograph the whole match, so it is up to you to put on and improvise the best match possible. The only requirement is there are specific spots management wants you to hit because the fans want to see what the fans want to see! Can you put on the most electrifying match and keep the fans cheering or will the only sound you hear after the 1-2-3 be the sound of crickets?&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game&#10;Unlike other head-to-head wrestling themed games or fighting games, the goal is not to beat your opponent by depleting their hit points. The goal is to put on the best match possible and getting the most fans (victory points)!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;1. Separate the cards into a Momentum Deck (cards 1 &ndash; 7) and a Spot Deck (cards 8 &ndash; 13).&#10;2. Place 3 pairs of Spot cards in the center of the table face up. The sum of each of the pairs is the goal you are trying to reach for each Spot.&#10;3. Place the Momentum Deck to another side.&#10;4. Each player draws 5 cards from the Momentum Deck.&#10;5. Choose a player to go first.&#10;&#10;Players now take turns playing a card from their hand on one Spot, trying to reach that goal on their turn. Reaching that goal perfectly wins the Spot and equates to more fans, but passing (when a valid card can't be played) forfeits the Spot to the opponent and giving them more fans. Cards played from the hand represent simple wrestling moves, like strikes and holds, that escalate to the Spot, which are power moves like DDTs and spears!&#10;&#10;When there are no Momentum cards or Spots remaining, players enter the Pin Fall attempt! Play turns into a War-style game, flipping over remaining cards in the hand to see who wins the pin. After the pin, all Perfect and Botched (passed) Spots are scored up.&#10;&#10;Reading your opponent, evaluating the cards in play, the cards in your hand, and measuring the potential outcomes on future Spots will determine the bright fan favorite in ASWG: Dark Match!&#10;&#10;"

The winner is the first player to exhaust their hand. There are special cards that use phrases that will be well known to London Underground travellers and which affect game play. For example, 'Planned Engineering Works' allows a player to specify a line that is 'closed' and so cannot be played until that player's next turn. The short rules include a variant that allows multi-game scoring.&#10;&#10;The cards replicate the iconic design of the London Underground map, and the game is licensed by Transport for London. It comes in a tin box that replicates the London Underground symbol (red circle crossed with a blue bar).&#10;&#10;"

The Japanese celebrate this occasion, as according to their traditions the goddess of Fuji mountain, Konohana Sakuya Hima, revives the fallen flowers at this time. The cherry flower is a symbol of vitality called &quot;sakura&quot;.&#10;&#10;The players in Sakura aim to play cards without taking any hands. They have to play two cards each time, one on each side of the Jin-Jang card following the rules, which by default require higher number on the Jin side and lower on the Jang side in the same color. (Alternatively, a player can place the same number in any color.) Also, the players are aided in their success by several characters, who require payment (money). The game ends when everyone has only two cards left in their hand. The player who earns the fewest points wins the favor of the goddess and glory will be theirs until next spring.&#10;&#10;&#10;This edition was later replaced with Sakura Extra Box, which contains previous Kickstarter extras (not exclusive).&#10;&#10;"

229600,,"A worker placement game for 1-4 players themed on the Pioneer Settlement of Kentucky in 1780.  Settlements simulate places such as Harrods Fort, Logans Fort, and Boones Station with each player representing the settlement leader.&#10;&#10;Each player has a Resource Board, a Structure Board and a set of cubes/tokens to track resources and activities.&#10;-    The resource board is a 5x5 grid of 25 spaces and is used to keep track of the 25 different type of players&rsquo; resources (Folk, Housing, Clothing, Happiness etc.)  Each resource has a specific starting value between 0 and 10 and will go up and down during the game as a consequence of decisions made and a range of random factors. Resources are used to expand and develop the players&rsquo; settlement and their use will need to be balanced to ensure a positive outcome.&#10;-    The Structure Board is a 4x4 grid of 16 spaces and used to keep track of a player&rsquo;s structures.  Each player starts with 10 cabins and 2 corral pens but additional structures can be built to expand the settlement.  Structures will require varying combinations of resources (labour, wood and lumber) to construct but will generate benefits for the settlement once built.&#10;&#10;Players share an Action Board.  The Action Board is used in the action phase and consists of a 6 x 5 grid of 30 spaces representing the 30 actions that can be taken by players.  Actions (e,g, clear land, hunting, soap making etc.) represent the activities undertaken by the settlers.  Most actions have limits such as resource availability or need for specialists but, if requirements are met, will lead to additional resources and/or advancement of the settlement.&#10;&#10;Players can take their turns simultaneously with each turn comprising 2 phases:&#10;&#10;1.   Growth Phase&#10;-    Roll once on the Growth Table per 20 Folk you have. Results will result in births or the arrival of immigrants (with some additional resources)&#10;&#10;2.   Livestock Phase&#10;-    Gain additional livestock per 5 livestock you own.&#10;&#10;3.   Boon Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 to gain benefits, normally in additional resources.&#10;&#10;4.   Action Phase&#10;-    Players get actions equal to their Folk resource score. Cubes are placed onto the action squares of the Action Board to reflect actions taken.  Adjust resource levels up and down accordingly.  At the end of the phase all cubes are removed from the Action Board.&#10;&#10;5.   Hardship Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 on the Hardship Table and resolve.  Hardship will result in loss of livestock, grain, food or folk.&#10;&#10;6.   Mishap Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 twice on the Mishap Table and resolve. Mishaps result in the loss of resources.&#10;&#10;7.   Raid Phase&#10;-    Roll 1D10 on the Indian Raid Table and resolve.  Results will be trade, fighting, theft of resources, and in certain cases the settlement might be overrun and the player eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;8.   Consume Phase&#10;-    Each of a player&rsquo;s folk consumes 1 Food and every 10 folk consume 1 salt.  Insufficient food or salt may lead to folk moving away or dying.&#10;&#10;9.   Seasonal Phase&#10;-    Each turn represents three months - keep track of the seasons - Spring to Summer to Fall to Winter.  If it is Winter roll once on the Winter Table and resolve.  Dependant on the severity of the winter additional fuel (wood and lumber) may be required and there may be a loss of livestock or folk.&#10;&#10;10.  Storage Phase&#10;-    A player adds up the total number of Grain, Food, Lye, Salt, and Gunpowder units he has. If this number is more than the number of containers held he must lose the difference.&#10;&#10;11.  Happiness Phase&#10;-    Gain 2D6 Happiness. Gain or lose happiness dependant on conditions within the settlement.&#10;&#10;12.  End Phase&#10;-    Ensure all counters and tokens are correctly placed, and no phases or players were skipped.&#10;&#10;The game lasts 5 years (20 turns).  The Player with the most awards at the end of the game wins.  There are 5 awards: &#10;-    Population Award: Most Folk&#10;-    Happiness Award: Most Happiness&#10;-    Builder Award: Most Structures + Plots&#10;-    Prosperity Award: Most Money&#10;-    Hoarder Award: Most Grain + Livestock + Food&#10;&#10;"
