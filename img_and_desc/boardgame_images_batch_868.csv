The meeples are free and live happily in their land. (Note: Its location is being kept a secret as you surely understand.) But that dream world is now troubled... Humans have discovered it and are kidnapping meeples to force them to work in their boardgames. There are only two possible outcomes: Fight the humans, as hard as that would be for the tiny meeples, or build rockets to leave for a new and peaceful planet!&#10;&#10;Leading your meeples, you will use trains that lead to different places in which you'll be able to enroll new meeples, repair your wounded foes, acquire resources, build rockets, and fight humans. But be prepared: Your glory will depend on the outcome of the end of the game. If the humans succeed in invading the meeple world before you can escape with the rockets, the one who fought the best will be rewarded; if not, the one who most helped the escape will be. Choose your side wisely!&#10;&#10;Save the Meeples is a worker placement game in which placement is disconnected from action, so you have to program your placement in a certain order, but you will take actions in reverse order.&#10;What's more, the winning conditions differ greatly depending on how the game ends ( fight or fly !), under the control of the players, not chance.&#10;&#10;"

Each animal is represented by a cardboard cutout that has a raised, second level to identify the animal's mouth. Inside the mouth is a pair of numbers &mdash; one green, one red &mdash; that shows how much vegetarian and meat-based food the animal needs in order to be satisfied.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they first roll the die to determine the difficulty level for that round, then they don the blindfold so that they can't see the playing area. The player scoops up some amount of food from the supply (which has a mix of red and green tokens), reaches out their hand, and tries to place the food in an animal's mouth. Any food that falls out or doesn't match the animal's needs is placed in the giant's intestinal tract. The die roll might let other players give advice (&quot;Move left! Pull your hand back!&quot;) or allow the player to recover one bit of food or otherwise receive aid during the round.&#10;&#10;"

These first two games will be available again in a new, updated dual package. In one box, you will get the first two volumes of the MPBS including:&#10;&#10;    Two additional battles for This Accursed Civil War: Cheriton 1644 and Cropredy Bridge 1644. Both battles were in designer Ben Hull's original Desk Top Published version, with Cheriton 1644 appearing later in C3i.  The Edgehill 1642 variant from Gustav Adolf the Great will be included as well.&#10;    For all battles, infantry and cavalry units will not be shared between battles for ease of setup and storage.&#10;    The battle specific cards introduced in Saints in Armor with be provided with Turn Track, Victory Conditions, Dead and Pursuit boxes to improve their utility (5 back printed cards)&#10;    The This Accursed Civil War Playbook will be brought up to the current series standard for ease of use.&#10;    Orders of battle and maps will be updated to reflect the latest scholarship.&#10;    Last but not least: the counters will feature formation icons requested by so many players over the years!&#10;&#10;&#10;  &#10;The Battles are:&#10;  &#10;&#10;    Edgehill 1642: Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    First Newbury 1643: Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry. Essex&rsquo;s stand on Round Hill stopped the Royalist and saved the rebellion.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Cheriton 1644: Sir William Waller&rsquo;s Southern and Western Association Armies with the help of the London Trained Bands defeated Hopton&rsquo;s Royalists in the rolling hills and hedges. The first in a series of victories in early to mid-1644 the signaled a turning tide in the war.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Cropredy Bridge 1644: Confident from his victory at Cheriton, Sir William Waller seeks to exploit a gap in the Royalist Main Army on the march. Waller divided his forces and attempted to trap part of the Royalist Army, but difficult terrain and quick reaction by the Royalists turned the tables and left much of Waller&rsquo;s army trapped and he was given a stinging rebuke.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Marston Moor 1644: The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to affect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arose: Cromwell, a name inextricably linked with the English Civil War and the key player in the following two civil wars.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Second Newbury 1644: The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Naseby 1645: The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634: Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Wittstock 1636: The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Second Breitenfeld 1642: Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;    Jankau 1645: Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign against the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emperor himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.&#10;&#10;&#10;  &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series Rulebook&#10;    &ldquo;This Accursed Civil War&rdquo; Playbook&#10;    &ldquo;Sweden Fights On&rdquo; Playbook&#10;    5 Counter Sheets&#10;    1 Series Marker Sheet&#10;    4.5 Back Printed Map Sheets (For 11 Battles)&#10;    6 Two-Sided Battle Specific Player Aid Cards&#10;    2 11x17 Folded Player Aid Cards&#10;    1 Orders Summary Card&#10;&#10;&#10;(from GMT website)&#10;&#10;"

Curiously, however, no other information seems to be available on it except from these stamps, and it is not mentioned in any of the major games books in my possession, including that by L'H&ocirc;te, who is usually a good source for games of the Francophone world.&#10;&#10;It is played by two people, on a board similar to that of Nine men's Morris, that is to say, there are 24 playing spaces arranged on the corners and mid-points of the edges of three concentric squares.  However, no diagonals are marked, and the spaces consists of holes, into which the players insert black and white sticks.  One of the stamps shows Eklan being played on an apparently traditional board fashioned into a small table, similar to those used in quality Go or Mancala sets.  The dimensions I give below have been estimated from those pictures (the depth being the approximate height of the illustrated table).&#10;&#10;The board is shown as having a narrow raised 'lip' around its edges, except at open at the corners.  The part of the board between this lip and the outermost set of eight holes is coloured beige, and the regions within it are respectively coloured white, green, and - at the centre - yellow.  Presumably these details are merely decorative.  The sticks would seem to protrude about 6 centimetres out from their holes, and the white ones slant towards one player, while the black ones slant towards his opponent who sits opposite.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

No accepted English name has been found for it, but the words &quot;kr&#196;&#153;gle szachowe&quot; can be translated as &quot;chess bowling&quot; or &quot;chess bowling pins&quot;.&#10;&#10;Lech Pijanowski, a Polish games expert, described it as a &ldquo;folk game&rdquo; known in Germany and Scandinavia.&#10;&#10;The game is played between two players (termed White and Black), who sit opposite each other across a 9&times;9 checkerboard, which has a line drawn around the central block of 3&times;3 squares.  The source illustrates this board as having dark squares in each corner.  Each player has nine undifferentiated pieces or stones.  Initially, each player places one of his pieces in the corner square to his right, and the other eight complete a square with the first piece as its corner.  White starts, and play is then alternate.&#10;&#10;Pieces move a single space, to any of the (maximum of) four diagonally adjacent squares.  Capturing is by custodianship, which is to say that an unbroken diagonal line of (one or more) enemy pieces, terminating with a friendly piece at one end of the line, will be captured if a second friendly piece is moved onto the space at the opposite end of the line.  [The source is silent on whether such a move can capture lines of enemy pieces in more than one direction].  Unusually, though, captured pieces do not vacate the board, but are placed elsewhere on the board on a vacant space chosen by the captor, with the restriction that the new space must be the same colour as that from which it was removed.  Thus, pieces will always remain on the same coloured square as that upon which they start the game.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to complete a previously agreed arrangement of ones own pieces in the marked central sector of the board.  Six examples of winning arrangements are:&#10;&#10;&ndash;o&ndash; || ooo || &ndash;&ndash;o || ooo || &ndash;&ndash;o || o&ndash;o   &#10;ooo || o&ndash;o || &ndash;&ndash;o || ooo || &ndash;o&ndash; || &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#10;&ndash;o&ndash; || ooo || ooo || ooo || o&ndash;&ndash; || o&ndash;o&#10;(where o represents a friendly piece, and &ndash; an empty square).  &#10;Arrangements involving more pieces are harder to achieve and will make for a longer game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Those who know the board game Bruxelles 1893 will rediscover its familiar look and feel in Bruxelles 1897.&#10;&#10;A game of Bruxelles 1897 is played over 4 rounds. A round consists of a variable number of turns. In this version, the different actions are represented by Action cards which are aligned in 4 columns.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has 5 Architect cards in hand. These cards have different values on them, ranging from 1 to 5, and you'll use them to perform actions in the Art Nouveau and Brussels areas.&#10;&#10;To perform an action in the Art Nouveau area, you must replace one Action card by one of your Architect cards and pay the latter's value. Actions in the Brussels area are free but they require an increasing number of Architect cards to activate, and you risk one of them being sent to prison. The different actions score you victory points throughout the game or help you to advance on the different tracks. These tracks also score you points at the end of the game, depending on the strategies you choose to adopt.&#10;&#10;When all players have passed, the round ends. Now, the different majorities are calculated. At the end of the round, the position of the Architect cards in the Art Nouveau area determines the majorities, which in turn grant bonuses and/or victory points.&#10;&#10;At the end of the fourth round there is a final scoring phase. The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Bruxelles 1897 : a game by Geek Attitude Games.&#10;&#10;The boardgame Bruxelles 1893 was published by Pearl Games in 2013.&#10;In 2014, Geek Attitude Games was founded by Etienne Espreman (the designer of Bruxelles 1893), Fr&eacute;deric Delporte and Fabrice B&eacute;ghin.&#10;Earlier this year, Etienne reclaimed the rights to his game.

World leadership came together to build a massive Flotilla, mankind&rsquo;s last bastion of civilization.&#10;&#10;Now, ten years after the disaster, the Flotilla is home to the very last of us.&#10;&#10;Flotilla features two distinct and interwoven modes of gameplay, as you try to outpace your opponents in bringing prosperity to humanity&rsquo;s new home. You begin the game as a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; Fleet Commander, commissioned by world leaders to explore the new face of the ocean, scour the depths for resources, and rescue any survivors you come across. At any point in the game, you may choose to turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; by selling your skiffs, and leaving your seafaring life behind to now grow the Flotilla itself.&#10;&#10;The choice of if or when to switch from a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; explorer to a &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; settler defines the very core experience of Flotilla. They represent two similar but distinct game experiences, utilizing the same game components, seamlessly intertwined among all players. If you switch, you&rsquo;ll flip over all of your accumulated game components, watching your crew grow into new roles with new art for the same characters, while finding entirely new uses for your ocean tiles and resources, and beginning to trade with the &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; players as you go after new objectives. As players turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; different niches are filled, forever changing the game&rsquo;s economy. Mastering this ebb and flow will be critical if you&rsquo;re to shape the new face of humanity!&#10;&#10;As a &ldquo;Sinksider,&rdquo; you will explore the ocean with your skiffs, pulling some of the 92 hexagon-shaped ocean tiles out of a bag, and arranging them to help you effectively collect resources, discover valuable artifacts from the sunken civilization, all while trying to avoid toxic radiation left from the disaster. You&rsquo;ll dive for supplies, rolling a pool of custom dive dice that vary based on the depth level of your skiffs. You&rsquo;ll also carefully manage your resources, trading them on the open market for the currency you can use to buy more skiffs and outposts, or stockpiling them for when you turn &ldquo;Skyside.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;As a &ldquo;Skysider,&rdquo; you will use your resources to build an expansive network of watercraft and docks, using the &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; of your ocean tiles. Your divers will also have new jobs as researchers, rolling custom, multicolor Research dice, to discover new technologies that allow the Flotilla to manage a growing population. You&rsquo;ll also build Sonar stations, making life a little easier for the &ldquo;Sinksiders&rdquo; still out exploring the unknown, while earning quite a few points for yourself.&#10;&#10;On both sides, you&rsquo;ll also grow your relationships with the four different governing guilds, each giving you unique bonuses and more powerful crew. The players with the strongest relationships will also earn valuable points at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;The components in Flotilla are unique, immersive, and interconnected. Your skiffs will be able to actually carry up to four resource barrels, and come in a unique shape for each player color. Artifact tokens slot into matching spaces in a double-layered hub board and art on the ocean tiles lines up to create a unique layout for your growing Flotilla each time you play.&#10;&#10;In Flotilla, you&rsquo;ll find significant strategic depth and variety, while giving players the freedom to tell their own story. Will you build the Flotilla by being the first to go Skyside, or stay Sinkside for the whole game, becoming the most powerful seafarer of them all?&#10;&#10;"

It may be perfect information but it is not an abstract...&#10;&#10;Apex Portal presents Lost Plateau, inspired by the 1912 classic novel, The Lost World, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  On this secret plateau, dinosaurs roam a land of volcanoes and treacherous cliffs.  Expeditions navigate stampeding dinosaurs while chasing and delivering eggs.&#10;&#10;Dinosaurs! At Apex Portal we love primal physical mechanics.    We evolved Lost Plateau for over 10 years. This design strived for 2 goals to produce primal tension.  First, to have dinosaurs with an elegant set of behaviors (stampede, defensive facing, double dino combinations) to spawn eggs and eliminate opposing dinosaurs.  Second, to balance the influence of the 2 entities, the expeditions and the dinosaur packs, so both are always in consideration for their way of scoring and to maximize the interaction between them.  Each player controls a pack and an expedition.  The dino behaviors are truly predatorial for the fun tactical side of the game.  When will your expedition feel safe to run the gauntlet of opposing dinos for the eggs?  That question and getting your packs into safe but threatening areas of the plateau is the strategy side of the game.&#10;&#10;Game Description&#10;   This is a physical primal game.&#10;   A player turn is 2 actions &ndash; may do the same action twice.&#10;Move Expedition Action &ndash; Pick up and deliver eggs to the Safe Camps by moving 2 spaces per action.  Or use the in-game Trail Blaze expansion to allow unlimited movement on established trails -- that can be co-developed between competitors.&#10;Move Dinosaur Action &ndash;  Dinos stampede dinos and opposing expeditions.  The dino is moved and then given facing to prevent stampede from one direction.  If both actions are Move Dino then sly double dino stampedes appear out of the mist!  This encourages dinos to stay within reach of pack mates and maximizes a true predator mind set &ndash;  you always see opportunity, but often don't see the other pack coming after you.&#10;&#10;Winning the game&nbsp;- Score 6 total eggs and/or dino captures.&#10;&#10;Two unique team versions for 4 to 6 players.  Can play as team mates or as competing &ldquo;pack mates&rdquo;.  Pack mates control and share the points scored by their pack, but don't share in egg scoring by their private Expedition.

Each player or team has 20 blazes.  The Blaze Action is the placing of 5 Blazes on any spaces of the board.  On move Expedition Action, the player may move the tent into any space that is adjacent and has at least 2 Blazes and at least one is of the player's color.  May move up and down connected trails with out limit on each Move Expedition action.  This adds deeper strategy in avoiding opponent dinos and adds co-opetition to jump in on other player's developed trails with your own Blazes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

One of these spaces is colored red and dubbed the &quot;bonus square&quot;. Each player takes 18 of the double-sided tokens, then places them in three groups of six, with their color face up.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you must place three of your tokens on the game board. The space that you place a token on must equal the number of tokens in the group before you placed that token. Thus, at the start of the game, you take a token from a group of six tokens, then place that token on a 6 space. Your next token must be placed on a 5 (if taken from the same group) or a 6 (if taken from one of your remaining two groups).&#10;&#10;If after placing a token, you have sandwiched one or more of the opponent's tokens, those opposing tokens are flipped over and placed next to the spaces they once occupied. These spaces cannot be played in again. If you would create a sandwich with yourself in the middle, then your own pieces are captured &mdash; unless you have simultaneously sandwiched the opponent at the same time, in which case you capture them instead.&#10;&#10;Once all the pieces have been placed, players tally their scores.
