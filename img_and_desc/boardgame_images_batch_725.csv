Probably published just after Federation in 1900, the game celebrates Australia's new nationhood as well as its participation in the South African conflict, in which the various Australian Bushmen's Contingents played a major part. It follows the path of a typical Bushman, proceeding from his enlistment to training, embarkation, arrival in South Africa, and engagements with the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game is basically a re-implementation of the traditional Game of goose, with players rolling dice and moving around a 60-space track. Most spaces have a themed text: Riding test, promoted to lieutenant, ordered to the front, taken prisoner, etc. Some of these spaces also incur bonuses or penalties (moving forward or back a number of spaces, to a particular space, or miss a turn).&#10;&#10;The board includes coloured illustrations of bushmen rounding up cattle in the Australian outback prior to enlistment, a street parade of a Bushmen's Contingents, transport ship, field hospital, field prison, troop ship S.S. Medic, and battle scenes showing Australian prisoners guarded by Boers, and Australian troops attacking a Boer position.&#10;&#10;"

Factions gain prestige points by successfully leveraging the strengths of their senators, political opportunities, senatorial influence, and treasuries as they engage in various aspects of Roman politics.  Prestige gained through popularity and success but can be just as easily lost through failures and conviction.  Victory is declared when one senator or faction has gained sufficient prestige as to be crowned the First Emperor of Rome.&#10;&#10;However, success will require both competition and cooperation as all factions must work together to ensure the stability of Rome.  Failures of the Senate and unmet public demand will increase civil unrest, leading to revolt.  Excessive war involvement will overextend Rome&rsquo;s military resources.  Spending more funds than what is available will bankrupt the State Treasury.  Any of these situations could ensure the fall of Rome causing all players to lose the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played over approximately 10 rounds until a victory condition is met or until all players are defeated by the game.  Each round is made up of six distinct phases:&#10;&#10;Election Phase:  &#10;Each player will take turns choosing offices to assign to Senators within their faction.  High Offices include High Consul, Low Consul, and Censor.  Lower offices include Praetor and Proconsul (assigned to govern one of the many provinces of Rome).  Player initiative is based on the overall faction prestige and 'bribes' made to the Assembly.&#10;&#10;Senate Phase:  &#10;Factions vote to raise legions, purchase grain subsidies, and deploy legions to war.  The more senators your faction has, the greater your ability to influence these decisions.  Beware&mdash;an &lsquo;Assassin&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mob Incitement&rsquo; card in the hands of a jealous senator played at the appropriate time can severely upset the balance of power.&#10;&#10;Republic Phase:  &#10;Senators now perform their duties in positions throughout the Republic.  This may include: Proconsuls hiring auxiliary legions to enhance provincial defenses, Senators in Rome attempting to persuade others to joint their faction, and even certain senators engaging in corruption to gain needed funding.  Rome must also respond to random events such as public demands, barbarian raids, provincial insurrection, and plagues.&#10;&#10;War Phase:  &#10;Wars are now resolved.  If victorious, the general returns to Rome with additional prestige and the potential of war spoils.  A stalemate will cause the general to return to Rome having lost prestige due to eroding public confidence.  A defeat will end in death for the general, an increase in public unrest, and the affected province being overrun.  Victorious generals also have the option of &ldquo;crossing the Rubicon&rdquo; to engage in civil war with the Roman State in an attempt to secure an early win.&#10;&#10;Trial Phase:  &#10;The Censor will prosecute corruption charges of the Senate.  For each successful conviction, the Censor gains additional prestige while the accused may either lose prestige or (in the case of murder or treason) be executed.&#10;&#10;Intersession Phase:  &#10;Because time is the great equalizer--Senators may die randomly of natural causes.  Victory conditions are then checked and the game is reset for the next round of play.&#10;&#10;Imperium:  From Republic to Empire was designed to be a simplified, more accessible alternative to Republic of Rome (Avalon Hill, 1990; Valley Games).&#10;&#10;Version 2.3.1 was submitted for publication in March 2022.&#10;&#10;"

Will you join with the government to protect unity, or will you join the rebels and fight for freedom and independence?&#10;&#10;2-5 players each lead a Champion warrior into battle and earn a Victory Point each time an opponent is defeated. You win the game by being the first to earn 3 Victory Points by defeating 3 opponents. BUT there's a twist! The game doesn't end for you when your Champion falls in battle. Instead, you just get back up on your feet, respawn your Champion, and continue fighting! Think of it as a sort of card-based battle-royal, like a Battle Arena game, where you play for KOs.&#10;&#10;Unlike other battle card games where players take their turns one-at-a-time, in Galatune everyone attacks simultaneously! It's an exciting formula that keeps the game moving and encourages players to predict and react to each other in real time.&#10;&#10;Great game for first-time gamers or serious pros!

Eight of the nine planets are used as bases for between two and eight players. Each player has five ships, with the objective of either eliminating an opponent's five ships or getting one of his ships onto an opponent's planet.&#10;&#10;Ships can either fire or move in a turn but not both. Range is measured not by star links but by number of squares counted orthogonally. Combat results are Hit or Miss, with the chance of a Hit increasing as range decreases. There are nine Firing Cards of 10 cards, with the number of the deck equal to the range and to the number of Miss cards it contains. Some of the result cards also trigger events through Space Conditions cards.&#10;&#10;The movement and combat systems interact. When a ship succeeds in hitting and eliminating another ship, it gets promoted, by a degree that varies with the difference in ranks between the two. A ship's level does not affect combat, but does determine how many stars it can move in a turn. Ship rank ranges from 1 to 12.&#10;&#10;"

These wars attracted naval officers recently unemployed&nbsp;by the end of the Napoleonic Wars as well as providing a proving ground for the first generation of naval heroes native to&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;America.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Updated rules introduce river and tidal currents, modified grounding rules for operations in the Rio de la Plata and Uruguay rivers, and the use of ship&rsquo;s boats to tow stranded or becalmed ships.&nbsp;In all, over&nbsp;two dozen&nbsp;battle scenarios ranging in size from a handful of ships per side, to full-blown fleet actions are presented.
