Your aim is to invest in these regional banks and build them up.  If the banks get large enough, you begin to score points for your efforts.  However, as the game wears on, events in the world threaten your more ambitious investments and other major financiers may also decide to make risky investments that run counter to your interests.

Players start as one of these tribal kingdoms anywhere on this map and compete with each other and with neutral kingdoms to unify Japan, or to build the strongest (winning) kingdom of Wa at least.&#10;&#10;The game borrows some mechanics and ideas from Civilization / Advanced Civilization, but there are unrelated mechanics as well, and a lot has been adapted to the smaller spatial scale and to the two/three-player limit. Trade is different, development is different, movement is different, to mention just a few, but still it feels a somewhat similar to Tresham's games that inspired 'Kings of Wa'.&#10;&#10;The game is still a prototype. The three-player expansion has not been tested much, and the characteristics of the civilization / advance cards may need further tweaking based on more playtesting.&#10;&#10;"
