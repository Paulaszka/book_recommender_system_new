The goal of this card game is to lay down cards as neatly and to build as many tunnels as possible. If a player completes a tunnel, he or she is allowed to clear away the cards and leave them as a reward in front of him or her. The one with the most gained cards in the end wins.&#10;Each player gets twelve cards and two cards that are the beginning of the tunnels. Then each player choses one card and discards faced down. The player with the highest number wins and is the first to place his card. It is important to only place cards to rows and columns in the same color (red, yellow, green, blue) and to place cards in the right number series. To gain points, the player has to complete a tunnel of four cards, which lay down in a row, a column or as a stack. The game ends if all cards are discarded. Additionally there are joker cards, which can be replaced for all other colors.&#10;&#10;"

No more dust rising or motors roaring. Instead you'll see sweet little cars run squeaking along the racing track. You must use the rally cards to move forward or wind up your spring. The more you wind it up, the more you will travel &mdash; but never wind more than needed, or things can go wrong. It's time to begin the race! The first person to finish two laps will win. Let's start the engines...I mean...wind your springs and let it roll!&#10;&#10;In Spring Rally, players control their toy car based on trick-taking mechanisms. The game lasts three rounds, and in each round, players play a card from their hand to advance their car on the track. If the player wins the trick, they move their car as much as the lowest number on the card played in the round. Other players wind up their spring, which can help to boost them along when they win a trick. As long as a player avoids winning a trick, they gain the chance to advance much more later &mdash; but too much winding makes your spring stop working!&#10;&#10;The player who first circles the track two times wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

I used to run a lodging house back east. Ran a couple more in different towns on route out here, too. Seems to be the way, that once a town starts gittin' big it starts attracting the wrong sort. That's why I'm here talking to you now. The last town I was in turned bad once some mean critters started calling the shots. I knew it was time to move on when the mayor appointed the town drunk as marshal. We're way out in the middle of nowhere here, so hopefully the bad seeds will fall short.&quot;&#10;&#10;In A Town Called Nowhere, you take the role of a pioneer settling a new town in the Old West. There'll be business opportunities aplenty for folks with an eye on the main chance and pitfalls too for those who don't cover their tracks. As you'd expect, there&rsquo;ll be saloons, gambling, and gunfights. There'll be a jail, a bank, and a gunsmith. There'll be a marshal, a schoolteacher, and a lady called Ruby; the bank will get robbed, the corral will burn down, and some big shot will run you out of business so he can build a grand hotel where your wash house stands. Once the dust settles, that same big shot will paint his name on the town sign and say, &quot;If anyone has any objections, they should speak up now&quot;. Will you say anything? Course not, you'll head back to your washboard and eke out a meagre existence scrubbing miner's socks. Of course, it doesn't have to turn out that way. I mean, no one's even driven a stake yet.&#10;&#10;The game takes place on the grid map of the Town of Nowhere, which is empty at the start of the game. As players take their turns and the game progresses the map will become populated with all the buildings and businesses you'd expect in the Old West.  Each player controls the movements and actions of their gang of associates as they move about town taking care of business and business can be anything from manning the counter at the dry goods store to gunning down the marshal.&#10;&#10;The player with the greatest prestige at the end of the game wins and gets to name the town after themselves.&#10;&#10;"

You will not discard in this scenario. All American Dreams cards will be played on the timeline.&#10;&#10;Example Of Play&#10;Player One sets down 1904 to start the game, which causes them to collect one Happiness card, concluding their turn. Player Two sets down 1907 to follow, causing them to collect one Liberty card, concluding their turn. Player Three sets down 1910 to follow, causing them to lose one Life card. On Player One's second turn at play, they choose to use one of their Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness cards that has an action&mdash;on this turn of play they have the option to trade a card with a fellow player. Player One chooses to take their 1 point value card and trade it for Player Two's 5 point value card.

The tiles represent the gears of a car, 1 through 5. The higher the gear, the further the distance the car moves. The special shapes at the ends of the tile mean that each tile can pivot in the previous tile to simulate steering. The lower the gear tile played, the further it is able to pivot in the previous tile. So, in first gear, although the car is not moving very far, it has the most maneuverability, while in 5th gear, the car is moving quite far but has the least maneuverability.&#10;&#10;Five tiles are played each turn, one after the other, and players must chain through the gears like in a real car. Each tile must be followed by a tile that is either the same gear, or one gear higher or lower than the previous tile. So, a 3rd gear tile can be followed by a 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear tile, but not a 1st or 5th.  This has the effect of simulating different handling characteristics at various speeds and, as the tiles must be chained together, simulates acceleration and braking as well. Once 5 tiles have been played, their car is moved to the end of the last tile and the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;There are two special types of tiles in the game and it&rsquo;s here that drifting comes into play. The first is a handbrake tile, which is used to start a car drifting. A normal gear tile cannot fit into a handbrake tile. A handbrake tile must be followed by one or more drift tiles. The unique shape of a drift tile means that they fit into the corner of a previously placed tile. They can be pivoted in a previous tile, like a normal tile but, if rotated all the way, may also be &ldquo;slid out&rdquo; along their flat side to &ldquo;feather&rdquo; the drift.&#10;&#10;Drifting, if done in special Drift Zones around the corners of the track, will earn players Edge Points. These points can be used on subsequent turns to break certain rules of the game. For instance, Edge Points can be spent to &ldquo;Powershift&rdquo;, allowing players to skip up and down gears. i.e. Jumping straight from 1st up to 5th gear or vice versa.&#10;&#10;There are, of course, more rules to the game but that should be enough to give you an idea of how the TrajecTile system works.&#10;&#10;In addition to a full set of TrajecTiles, DRIFT features 4 highly detailed plastic car miniatures and a set of modular track sections for unlimited replayability as well as player boards with gearshifts to track player&rsquo;s Edge Points and gears from turn to turn. A set of cards to track race positions and reference cards for the various &ldquo;special maneuvers&rdquo; that players can purchase with Edge Points earned through drifting are also included along with sand timers to time the players turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The game includes three different cards from each field, thus a game can show 12 different effects.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players choose one of two options.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a card and place it in front of their personal board as long as it does not exceed its slot limit.

The game board resembles a fairy tale book, with four individual elements on it.&#10;&#10;In the game, players cling to the side of the friendly yellow snake Salamamba as it attempts to outsmart the poisonous magician Fiesolix. Both characters move each turn through the use of dice. The sorcerer's purple die places obstacles in the way of the snake and makes Fiesolix move faster on his own path. The snake's yellow die moves Salamamba through the forest to complete its tasks, but instead of simply moving forward, the snake grows by as many pieces as the number on the die. Additionally, the snake can shrink, if desired, or swap the location of its head and tail to turn around.&#10;&#10;"

To set up, give everyone a ship that has room for twelve items (four under the deck out of view of others), then dump all of the equipment tiles in the center of the table. Take thirteen adventure cards in the appropriate number of the appropriate types (discovery, trade, pirates, contract), then lay them out in a circle around the equipment.&#10;&#10;When everyone is ready, reveal the adventure cards, then race to fill your ship with equipment tiles using only one hand, adding two colored goods in the special slots for those. Whoever finishes first scoops the cards up so that everyone else has to finish equipping their ship without seeing what's coming. You then shuffle the cards, then reveal them one by one:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Discovery: When this type of card is revealed, you can discard the 1 or 2 equipment tiles shown to receive the goods or money instead. Whenever you receive goods, they must be placed in an empty space on your ship; you can discard equipment to make room for them, if you wish.&#10;    Trade: You can trade the one good on the left of the card for the 2-3 goods on the right, if you wish.&#10;    Pirates: Before revealing this card, every player must say either fight or flee. If you flee, nothing happens to you. If you fight, you must be able to discard the equipment shown on the card or else you're penalized and must ditch some money and aa good; if you do have the equipment to drive the pirates away, you receive the reward shown on the card.&#10;    Contract: Place this on the bottom of the deck until only contract cards remain, then reveal them one by one. If you have the 1-4 goods showing on the card, you can discard them to get the monetary reward.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, convert every remaining good into 1 coin, then for each ten coins, convert them into a treasure chest and place it on an empty space in your boat. Now you'll have less room on board for the second leg of this trip, which plays out nearly identically to the first one.&#10;&#10;In the end, whoever has the most money wins!&#10;&#10;"
