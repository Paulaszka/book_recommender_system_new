The players then take turns to move the McGuffin from player to player with their cards. At the end of the round the player who has the McGuffin may or may not open it. If they choose to keep it closed they gain 1 victory point. If they open it and it is treasure they get 2 victory points. If there is a bomb inside they lose 1 victory point. After 3 rounds whoever has the highest victory points wins.&#10;&#10;For now this is a playtesting copy of the new McGuffin that will be KickStartered soon.&#10;&#10;

Players have several paths to choose from and will encounter large wheels of cheese, traps, guards, items of all sorts, and many other wonders.&#10;&#10;This game has story-telling at the heart of it. As each encountered item is revealed, the player must make up a story to indicate how to pick up/ward off/handle the situation. Once the story is told, a judge is picked from the other players at the table and the story is ranked on a scale of likelihood. The player then must make a die role to determine the attempt's success or failure for that encounter. Other players may also toss in a coin to challenge the original story and a roll-off ensues.&#10;&#10;Rules guide the players in basic mechanics such as movement, but the story-telling aspect opens up the game to nearly limitless possibilities.&#10;&#10;"

You know it's that creepy house on the corner, and you have had enough. You are each going to gather a group of friends from the neighborhood and make a mad dash into the house to try to get your items back.&#10;&#10;To start The Kids vs. The House, players determine how many items &mdash; as few as one and up to twenty &mdash; they need to recover from the house. This allows them to customize the length of their game.&#10;&#10;You then flip the fist item card over and see how many kid team points you need to have to try to get the item back.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with two cards from the Action/Kid deck. This deck contains kids from the neighborhood worth 1-5 points each that you add to your hand to try to build up a team with enough points to retrieve the item. There are also four other types of cards that cause things, do things, and help protect you from the creepy things that can happen in the house:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Chaos cards always go off when drawn. Chaos she is a harsh mistress.&#10;     Protection cards are used to prevent or deflect many of the negative events and actions in the game.&#10;     Incident cards can be played on other players during your action phase to try to disrupt their chances of acquiring the item.&#10;     Trap cards always go off when drawn, with the house apparently trying to defend its ill-gotten gains. Beware the house!&#10;&#10;&#10;During your turn, you draw a card from the Action/Kid deck. If it doesn't instruct you to play it immediately (traps and chaos cards), then you can put it in your hand. You then have the option to perform an action. If you have a card that is playable (Incident and some Chaos), you can play this on the other players to help yourself or hurt their chances to win.&#10;&#10;Turns proceed around the play area until someone has at least as many points in their hand as shown as the target number on the item. Once that minimum is met, they can choose to fold their hand and place it face down. They now cannot be targeted by any incidents, but can be affected by Chaos and Trap cards.&#10;&#10;Once a person folds, everyone yet to play in that round draws one card, then everyone reveals their cards to see who has the most points and clams the item.&#10;&#10;If this wasn't the final item, shuffle the cards and repeat with the next item. When the final item is claimed, the person with the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;---&#10;We currently are planning a Kickstarter launch in August 2016&#10;&#10;"

The debate centered around how much horse cavalry to keep mixed in with the tanks, trucks and other combat vehicles. The idea was the large mass of unmotorized units would form a &quot;base of maneuver&quot; from which the relatively more scarce -- but elite -- moto-mech units would operate.&#10;&#10;Of course, by the war's midpoint all that had been settled. The question had come to center on determining the optimal mix of tracked and wheeled vehicles, etc.&#10;&#10;Today, we're witnessing a similar transformation in that the former moto-mech elite has, in effect, taken on the role of the previous era's foot-sloggers and horse cavalry: they're now the new &quot;base of maneuver&quot; element, holding the line while, evolving atop and past them, is the new elite: the special forces, which are themselves increasingly robot-equipped.&#10;&#10;Given that the cost and social advantages involved in deploying small elites rather than the mass mechanized armies of the previous era (the draft isn't going to come back), I see us now at about the 1938-equivalent in terms of the new transition.&#10;&#10;Aside from that, another characteristic is more and more of the First World's armies combat experience is increasingly contained within the personnel of the SoF. That, of course, further enhances their relative combat power.&#10;&#10;To smoothly model all that, I've come up a system I've titled the &quot;Big And Dumb Armies Super System&quot; (BADASS). I'll be using it again.&#10;&#10;This design will be appearing in Modern War issue number 29 (May-June 2017).&#10;&#10;"

You and your fellow players are buying shares of the railroads that will expand across Russia, attempting to enrich yourself along the way and not lose control of railroads to the Tsar!&#10;&#10;Trans-Siberian Railroad &mdash; originally one of three titles in Winsome Games' 2015 Essen Set &mdash; shares some similarities with older Winsome titles in which the rail network is already printed on the board and individual railroad companies purchase the links that are printed. Four companies (Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow) are active at the start of the game, with one share of each company auctioned to the players in that order to provide starting capital for those companies. The winner of each auction chooses an unoccupied link from Moscow to another city; each link has a value listed in it, and the railroad's initial income is set to this value.&#10;&#10;Once the game begins, on a turn you can:&#10;&#10;&bull; Buy stock, specifically one share in one company or one share each in two different companies; the money paid is placed in the railroad's treasury, and when you buy two shares, you must pay an additional $4 to one of the two companies.&#10;&#10;&bull; Build links, specifically one link, two links, or one external link (i.e. to a location on Russia's border) &mdash; but only if the railroad is public (i.e., at least two shares have been purchased) and you hold at least as many shares in that railroad as each other player. (If a railroad has had only one share of stock purchased, it is private.) You can build direct links that extend that railroad's existing network or you can jump another railroad's links to extend the network in a more convoluted way. When you build two links, the second link must start from where the first link built that turn ended. The cost to build an internal link is $4, and if you jump another railroad's links, you must pay $2 to that railroad's treasury; the cost to build an external link is $8, plus $4 to each railroad per link you jumped.&#10;&#10;When you build a link, the value of that link &mdash; 2-6 &mdash; is added to that railroad's income. Each time a railroad's income marker lands on or passes over a black mark on the income track, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level. Additionally, when you build two links or an external link, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level.&#10;&#10;&bull; Pass.&#10;&#10;When you buy two shares, build two links, build one external link, or pass, you move the timing token one space on the timing track. When this token reaches the end of the track, each railroad pays dividends to those who hold stock in it, with the railroad's income being divided by the number of shares owned, then rounded up. If Red has $11 income and you own two shares and another player owns one, then you receive $8 and the other player $4.&#10;&#10;After paying out dividends (and re-setting the timing token to 0), if any railroad has a stock value of at least $48, then the game enters phase 2, which starts with an auction for a share of the black and white railroads, with the winner of each auction claiming any one non-external link for that railroad that connects to another railroad's network.&#10;&#10;In phase 2, once you pay out dividends, you check to see whether any railroad's stock value is equal to or less than the nationalization value, which starts at $24 and which increases after each dividend payout in phase 1, each failure to auction a railroad's share at the start of either phase, and each dividend payout in phase 2 during which no railroads were nationalized. If a railroad's stock value is less than the nationalization value, that railroad is nationalized, with each owner of its stock getting one final dividend payment, after which all shares of that railroad are removed from the game. Once all nationalizations are complete, the nationalization value is increased three levels for each nationalization that took place.&#10;&#10;If at this point any railroad has a stock value of $75 or the dividend marker has reached the end of the track, the game ends; otherwise players continue playing. When the game ends, players sum the value of the stocks they hold in public railroads with any money they have on hand. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;"

These gangs are commanded by major crooks (boss cards), each of which can have an additional number of secondary burglars (action cards). The more criminals that a player places in a particular district, the more influence they obtain there, so the more likely they are to earn the valuable reward awarded by the district. In addition, players can also collect sets of art pieces that will provide extra victory points at the end of the game. In the end, the player whose gang scores the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;It's Mine is a gamers' game played in six rounds with a colorful and minimalist design that combines card drafting and set collection with area control mechanism. Players have challenging decisions such as commanding thugs, stealing precious works of art and burning evidences. Each city has its particular set of cards, so the game has a high replay value.&#10;&#10;"

If you can outsmart your fellow pirates by using your brains and trading skills, you'll probably end up with the most valuable loot!&#10;&#10;Stingy is an interactive booty-swapping game for 2-6 players, with the booty in question being rum, parrots, coins, diamonds, and pirate flags; these first four items come in four colors, with 3-6 tiles of each item in those colors, while the pirate flags come only in black (as you might expect).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with six randomly drawn tiles, with the remainder of the tiles being scattered face down on the table or placed in the included pouch. On a turn, you swap tiles with a fellow player, then draw 1-2 tiles and add them to your collection. When you swap, you choose an opponent, then take all the tiles of one group (matching symbol &amp; matching color) and add it to your collection. Each group has a value, with the values mostly being pyramidal (1 tile = 1, 2 tiles = 3, 3 tiles = 6, etc.). In return, this opponent then takes one or more groups from you that sum at most the same value as what you stole. If it's impossible to take groups this way, that opponent can take groups that sum to a lower value or demand that you hand over groups that sum to a higher value, with you choosing which groups you give up.&#10;&#10;When you collect all the tiles in a group (e.g., four blue parrots), you place those tiles face down to the side. No one can take these tiles from you.&#10;&#10;After the last tile is drawn, each player takes one final turn, then players score points &mdash; but only for the complete groups that they've collected. Whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Stingy includes two-player rules that introduce a ghost pirate with whom players can trade, a variant in which players also score points for the number of differently colored groups they collect, and a &quot;Captain Sly&quot; variant in which an opponent who can't take tiles worth at most what you took gets nothing. Good luck trying to make those unfair trades!&#10;&#10;"
