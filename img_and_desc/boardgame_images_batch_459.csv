The board is a seven-by-six grid with grooved grid lines. The intersections of the grid are known as Hubs. The pieces are solid cylinders that lie in the grooves of the board in between the Hubs. The grooves that lie along the longer edges of the board are the goal lines. Each player has two Woods and two Granites while the Flag is a communal piece.&#10;&#10;Each move is a single 90 degree rotation in any direction off a Hub. Woods can only do ordinary rotations (Free moves). Granites can do Free moves but can also shunt past any Woods that they&rsquo;re connected to (Shunt moves). The only way you can move the Flag is by rotating it off any of your own pieces that it&rsquo;s connected to (Flag moves). Players take alternate turns to make their plays. You have two moves per play to move your pieces, and you can also move the Flag as many times as you wish and at any time in your play.&#10;&#10;Create structures with your pieces to move the Flag forward, and try to break up any structures that your opponent may be trying to build. Once you have moved the Flag onto your opponent&rsquo;s goal line, you&rsquo;re the winner.&#10;&#10;"

If possible, may pick up that cargo and begin new chain ... all stops in these consecutive chains count towards the number of stops; chains with more stops are worth more VP. Alternatively, may make multiple deliveries with different starts/ends, but you must calculate VP for each such chain separately. Save all delivered cargo in your score pile; at end of game, you get bonus VP for having visited more planets. You can use Copilot cards in 2 ways:&#10;- use max 1/maneuver card, to alter one of the 2 planets shown by 1&#10;- place on a cargo to reserve it until your next turn; if someone else takes it, they lose 5VP; if you fail to make the run next turn, you lose 5VP and the card. Otherwise, you get your card back next turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, draw up to a hand size of 2 (if you had fewer), then replenish the face up display. If you reveal the alien, place it at just beyond Pluto. At the end of each turn, it advances 1 step. Alternatively, it can be picked up like cargo and delivered to Earth.

A Public Outrage Track is used for this. If this track reaches (25) both players will lose, so they must work cooperatively to keep the public at ease about their experiments while still competing against each other.&#10;&#10;Requirements:&#10;For this game you&rsquo;ll need the deck of 54 cards consisting of:&#10;&#10;&bull; 12 Capek Golem body part cards, 6 per player&#10;&bull; 39 game cards showing areas of scientific inquiry, gold coins and field research journal entries&#10;&bull; 3 cards which make up the Auction House and Public Outrage Track&#10;&bull; 40 markers for the Capek Golem cards (eurocubes work well) [Alternately you can use 6d6 per player, placing one die on each Golem card and rotating the die up each time a resource is gained towards the specified total.] and one additional marker for the Public Outrage Track&#10;&#10;To win a player must activate all six parts of their Capek Golem.

Buy cards from the Auction Area and play them immediately or place it in your hand.&#10;Purchase a single card at its Auction value by discarding cards with an equal or greater number of gold coins. Then discard it immediately and take Field Research resources as indicated, and move the token up or down the Public Outrage Track, or place the card in your hand and use it later on for its gold value or to complete a Scientific Inquiry set. Repeat buying a card as desired.&#10;&#10;2. Discard a set of Scientific Inquiry cards and mark gained resources on your Capek Golem Cards.&#10;Discarding a completed set, matching both a color and number as indicated on a Capek Golem card, allows you to place a marker in that resource area, helping to activate that card. You can choose either of the two color types to collect for a set, but you cannot make a set with a mix of both colors. There are 3 special wild cards in the game which may be used in any set and can take the place of one or two cards (as marked). If you use one of these cards in a Scientific Inquiry set, you must move the token on the Public Outrage Track as indicated.&#10;&#10;3.

Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas.&#10;&#10;Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron&rsquo;s train reaches the last track.&#10;&#10;To secure wealth, players explore the terrain of the provided map tiles for oil wells, and they survey and build their derricks. Map tiles are double-sided and modular, ensuring a unique experience every time. Money is made if a player can transport his oil to one of three oil companies, and win the right to sell at auction. The Oil Baron's train moves nearer every turn, counting down the rounds of the game's thrilling ride; all the while it begs you and your fellow prospectors to ask the question: Am I making enough money?&#10;&#10;The landscape of the Texas Oil business can be fickle and lonely as it is arid. Players can strategize against their opponents, and upset their play through special actions. During auctions, players can even lie about the value of their Sales Licenses in order to force their neighbors to bid more! But careful, you future tycoons &ndash; if you're caught bluffing, you're penalized.&#10;&#10;Although Black Gold is a satisfying bidding game, it is also an exciting contest of strategy and exploration. Every game variable can offer an advantage or variation in play each round. The round's starting player has the first choice for powerful Action cards, which dictate his options for that round. Subsequent prospectors can be savvy and alter their exploration based on other players' surveying, or the last player could choose to sell his oil at a different company than his neighbors and find an easier auction at which to bid.&#10;&#10;Black Gold is easy to learn, but offers an abundance of intriguing game play choices. Black Gold also provides players with optional rules that can shorten or extend game play, increase the challenge, give inexperienced players a handicap, or even reduce the randomness of well distribution. With all of these options players will discover that Black Gold is a new experience every time, even offering unique variation depending on player number, map tile setup, and well placement.&#10;&#10;"

Rolling doubles explodes the dice (roll the doubles again and add to the previous roll). Any rolls of 6 automatically cause 1 point of damage to their opponent's Stamina.&#10;&#10;&#10;     If a round was won using Strength, any character reduced to zero or less Stamina loses and is out; if all characters have no Stamina, the match is a draw.&#10;     If a round was won using Agility, the winning character has pinned the losing character. Pinning a character for three consecutive rounds will cause that character to lose.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of each match, players can increase their character's stats using Glory Points (1 GP is gained for each point scored in their rolls, and an additional 100 GP goes to the winner of a match). Buying an additional Strength or Agility die costs the current number of dice x 100 GP (each additional die bought also adds 5 Stamina).&#10;&#10;There are additional rules for using teams, weapons, and stunning. The game includes a worked example, pre-made characters, and blank character cards.&#10;&#10;"

It's fast-paced, challenging, and easy to learn - and everyone plays every round! The spinner determines the letters and category for each round. For instance, the category might be &quot;Food &amp; Drink&quot;, and you may be looking for words that begin with a 'P' and contain an 'A' - 'Pizza' and 'Pasta' may come to mind, or maybe 'Pancakes' and 'Peaches'. What about &quot;Places&quot; that start with a 'B' and contain an 'N'? You may think of 'Boston' or 'Birmingham'. If you can't think of any &quot;Places&quot; with those letters, you can still score points - just fewer - by coming up with words outside the category, like 'Banjo', 'Bargain', etc. You get the picture. There are different ways to score points, and the more points you score the more spaces you advance on the board. Every round provides a whole new challenge, and there are countless possible combinations to wrap your mind around. WORDPLAY is addictive fun that will make your head spin!&#10;&#10;"

Players take turns placing their figures on a tile, one token per tile, then the game begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves a number of spaces equal to the number of treasures on the tile where he's currently located, then he claims the tile on which he was standing; he replaces this tile with one from the deck, orientating the tile as he desires. (Orientation matters as some tiles feature walls, which block a player's movement. If a player cannot move the required number of spaces on his turn, he picks up his token and places it on any space he wishes.)&#10;&#10;Whenever a newly placed tile shows a bandit on it, the bandit figure moves one space closer to the cave entrance. A player can move to the cave entrance and exit the cave, keeping all treasures that he's collected &ndash; but if the bandit figure reaches the entrance while a player is still in the cave, he loses all his treasures (and undoubtedly his head). The player who escapes the cave with the most treasures wins.&#10;&#10;"

The dice are used as the race cars with the speed recorded on the die so everyone can see the state of the racers with just a glance. The cards are used both as the track which is customizable to the players taste  and as a means to maneuver by matching the track sections you travel over with the same types from your hand.  Some track cards have hazards on them allowing you to put obstacles in your opponent&rsquo;s way forcing them to expend cards or take damage.  Racers also have Nitrous Oxide tanks for an added boost for passing or just staying ahead of the pack.&#10;&#10;
