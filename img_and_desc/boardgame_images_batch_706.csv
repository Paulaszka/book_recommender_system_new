Players have the choice of 12 directions to shoot from each hex and can even plan for fade and slice!&#10;This course has everything a real course would; straight fairways; water and trees as hazards; elevation changes and even simulated wind conditions.&#10;&#10;The game is different every time &ndash; there are 60 different wind settings and 32 different clubs. Four 12-sided dice establish the strategic variability expected with ace runs, doinked putts, roll-aways, out-of-bounds, elevation change, lost clubs, and difficult lies. You will feel the joy of an excellent shot and the defeat of a poor decision. Doshboardgolf is all the strategy of golf on your table.&#10;&#10;In Doshboardgolf, each player selects a set of 8 club cards that have differing distance and hook numbers. Players will have all the clubs they need, from the maximum distance driver and mid-range approach club down to the putter which will be used when holing out.&#10;The distance will be determined by rolling a blue die, and the hook determined by the red die only after consulting the players chosen club card.&#10;&#10;Using advanced rules, a black die is introduced to simulate roll-aways when you land next to a downhill hex. Also making the game more realistic is elevation changes and penalties when having to shoot out of a hex containing trees.&#10;&#10;During a turn, each player in order will:&#10;1. Plan a shot direction using one orange pawn as a directional marker on the board. Players have the ability to execute planned fade and slice to overcome obstructions on the board such as trees, water hazards and elevation changes&#10;2. Select a club card from your 8 available options and place it face up for all players to see&#10;3. Execute the shot by rolling the blue and red dice. After consulting the chosen club card, the blue die determines the distanced travelled, and the red die determines the hook which will happen after the distance is calculated&#10;4. Place your player token in the new lie or if you have successfully holed out, mark your score on the included scorecard&#10;Play continues in this way with the player furthest from the hole always going next.&#10;As in real golf, the player with the lowest score at the end of the 9 hole round is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

Only a single chariot blocks your path to victory, so it's time to get uncivilized.

Use the dice to complete two laps on the dusty arena's circuit and be the first to steer your chariot over the finish line. On a player's turn, if they have gained enough Favors of Fortuna, they can repair their chariot. Depending on the chariot's speed on the previous turn and its current condition, the initial speed is determined, which defines how many of the five dice will be rolled during the turn. Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals.&#10;&#10;However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race.&#10;&#10;"

Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards.

It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game.

Each round, the active player draws a Description card (which features an adjective that might be &quot;Gnarly&quot; or &quot;Mental&quot;, or &quot;Harsh&quot;) from the deck, then the other players each secretly choose the Thing card in hand that best matches that description and plays it face-down on the table.  (Things might include &quot;Wastoid&quot;, &quot;Bootleg CD&quot;, or &quot;Pac-Man&quot;)  The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Thing card that, in his opinion, best matches the Description card, which he awards to whoever played that Thing card. This player becomes the new active player for the next round.&#10;&#10;Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The box suggests 3-4 players because of the number of cards available.  But with integrated sets it easily plays with 8 or more players.&#10;&#10;"

Unfortunately, the other (jealous) Keepers insist on making fun of your panda in the hopes that it will meet with a Tragic Ending instead.&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;&#10;Keepers take it in turn using Flattery cards to increase their Panda's Happiness or Insult cards to increase other Pandas' Sadness. The deck also includes Therapy cards that can remove Insults from your panda, Zinger cards that make the Insults that little bit meaner, and Mischief cards that allow you to bend the rules.&#10;&#10;If at the start of their Keeper's turn a Panda has a Sadness of 10, then the Keeper draws a Tragic Ending. If they manage to cheat death, survive and have a happiness of 10 then the Keeper draws a Happy Ending.

Each player has a customized deck of 40 cards. As zombies attack a player, they discard cards from his deck. When a player can no longer draw more cards, he is eaten by the zombies, and another player wins.&#10;&#10;Each turn has three phases:&#10;&#10;     Defense phase: In the defense phase, the player can use their weapons. Each weapon comes with a limited ammunition supply; each time you shoot, the player has to remove a bullet. If a weapon is out of ammunition it can not be used.&#10;&#10;&#10; In this period you you can play cards from your hand, activate items and host zombies in your locations.&#10;&#10;     Regroup phase: The player gets new energy and readies his items and locations, making them available to use once again.

But, just enough gold to battle over.&#10;&#10;Two rival towns are mining gold and hiring the able bodied to build their towns into cities and their militias into capable armies.&#10;&#10;Iron &amp; Brass (like its inspiration, the Warcraft PC games) challenges players to select the right strategy, then execute that strategy to defeat your opponent.  Hoard resources, build up defenses, build up an army, or some of each - all while your opponent is doing the same.&#10;&#10;Iron &amp; Brass is a Print and Play game played on a 10x10 to 16x16 square grid game board.  Each player has 14 structures and 24 military units available to build.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a Headquarters, Barracks, 8 Gold, 1 Crew, and 8 &quot;Advantage&quot; tokens which can each be used as an Attack, Range, Movement, or Heal bonus.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player may take up to 4 actions, any combination of: Mine Gold, Hire Crew, Move, Attack, Train Infantry, Build Structures or Vehicles.&#10;&#10;Because of limited Gold in the game, players will need to decide how to balance gathering resources with building up defensive structures and building their army.  In addition, their army can be built quickly with Infantry units, or more slowly by first building structures such as Foundries, Arsenals, and Steam Works to build up armored units, artillery, and tanks.&#10;&#10;Attacks are resolved by comparing Attack Strength + dice roll (+ Surge &quot;Advantage&quot; if played) to Defense Strength + dice roll (+ Surge &quot;Advantage&quot; if played).  Defending units may be destroyed, disabled, or sustain no damage.&#10;&#10;A player wins the game by destroying their opponent's Headquarters or all of their opponent's army.&#10;&#10;Cover art was created by Todd Sanders, winning the cover art design contest for this game.  Some of the game piece art was created by BGG user &quot;Skoll&quot;.  He created images for: &quot;Skirmisher Patrol&quot; and &quot;Iron Infantry&quot;, and because of those, really helped create the look and feel of the rest of the game piece images.&#10;&#10;"

Because of its unique interactivity, JYNX can be played with a family-friendly G-Rating or NSFW R-Rating depending on players.&#10;&#10;JYNX naturally invokes the two things I love about card games: Everyone laughing and everyone trash-talking as the game gets closer to finding a winner. JYNX can go in any direction the players choose, and that asks for fun memories and great game nights.&#10;&#10;Each game consists of seven card combinations, called CHAPTERS. Each chapter contains various forms of sets and runs.&#10;&#10;While completing each chapter, players are forced to perform hilarious actions called JYNXES. A JYNX is created by combining a WHAT and WHEN card. A WHAT card (from the player on your left) explains the action you must perform and a WHEN card (from your hand) explains when you must perform it. If you forget to perform a JYNX, then you suffer consequences that can slow you down and prevent you from winning.&#10;&#10;You win the game by being the first player to finish all 7 chapters in numerical order.&#10;&#10;"
