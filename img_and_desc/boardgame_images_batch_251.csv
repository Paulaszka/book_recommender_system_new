Each player also receives a number of strategy cards that let him launch rescue attempts, foils other's attempts at rescues, move dolls from one player to another, etc.&#10;&#10;Players must negotiate for the release of their dolls.  If talks break down, a player can execute dolls that he has possession of.  Coming up with innovative methods of execution is also part of the game (Chopping up a pipe cleaner man and sending him back one piece at a time, lighting a doll on fire, running over a doll with your care are only a few possibilities).&#10;&#10;"

In the 2 player version, one player controls the Spartans and the other player controls the Persians. In the 3 player game, 2 players compete for the most Glory as the Spartans, and in a 4 player game, 2 players also compete as the Persians for the most Spartan kills.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the battle forces (represented by round cardboard Units) are already lined up and ready to fight at the border of the Hot Gates. Each time a Persian Unit dies, the Spartans score Glory Points on the Glory Track that surrounds the board. Spartan Units die permanently, while most defeated Persian Units can enter the game again as reinforcements.&#10;&#10;The Object of the Game for the Spartans is to score 100 Glory (or 50 Glory if there are 2 Spartan players). The Object of the Game for the Persians is to wipe out the Spartans before they can achieve their Glory, or to delay the Spartans long enough for Ephialtes to reach the end of the Goat Path (6 rounds of play). If there are 2 Persian Players, then the player with the most Spartan kills wins this game.&#10;&#10;The game uses cards and dice to simulate the action from the film. Spartan Heroes include Leonidas, Stelios, the Captain, Dilios, and Astinos. Persian Leaders include Xerxes, the Uber Immortal, and the Persian Generals. Each card simulates the action associated with a quote from the film, such as &quot;I Would Gladly Kill My Own Men For Victory&quot; (Persian) and &quot;Tonight We Dine In Hell!&quot; (Spartan).&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly (20 - 30 minutes), and is meant to be a fast diversion with a good share of both tactics and luck.&#10;&#10;Official 2-Player Variants&#10;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/671632/2-player-variants&#10;&#10;"

This game was designed in 1997, printed in one edition of 1,000 copies and sold in &ldquo;head&rdquo; shops in Canada, Hawaii and Seattle. Press releases stated that it cost the two men behind the project about $50,000 Canadian to get the game to market. The reviewers' copy, numbered 106/1000 and signed by the designer, was found in a thrift shop for $3.99.&#10;&#10;Play is divided into three phases, corresponding to the three growing seasons. The length of the game is derived from the number of Seasonal Cards, which is adjusted according to the number of players in the game. Each player starts with a car, six Plant tokens and $9,000 cash.&#10;&#10;Each player-turn a player turns over one Seasonal Card and two &ldquo;Daily Grind&rdquo; cards. He moves (moving costs money, a player can go as far as he wants to spend) to a location and sets up grow-ops.&#10;&#10;Indoor operations require periodic rent and the investment of Equipment and Plant tokens. Yields are smaller but come every turn, and are measured in salable ounces or new Plant Tokens to start other operations. Indoor operations are usually less risky unless someone &ldquo;rats you out&rdquo; for a quick $3,000.  Outdoor operations are set up in spring or summer. They do not need rent or equipment but are subject to the depredations of deer, rabbits, wandering hikers or police helicopters. Outdoor operations are harvested once per game, in the autumn, and players have to travel to the location to do the harvesting themselves &ndash; so, depending on where you and the other players are, you may lose some crop.&#10;&#10;Between seasons players pay bills and rent, and may buy or sell equipment. At the end of the game (when all the Seasonal Cards have been turned up), players calculate the value of all Equipment and harvested outdoor Plants, and any salable ounces (a handy price table is supplied if you are too zonked to do the multiplying yourself). Players then pay all outstanding bills, loans, and fines. The winner is the one with the most cash on hand.&#10;&#10;This would be an unremarkable farming-type game, if not for the illegal nature of the crop. This frames the rather small amount of player interaction (which is mostly limited to ratting out other players for a quick buck, or negotiating commissions for other to sell or harvest dope for you at locations where you aren&rsquo;t), the random disasters that can befall players through the Daily Grind deck, and the pro-legalization rhetoric found throughout the rules. The rest of the game is about investing funds and taking risks &ndash; it might as well be about growing Swiss chard.&#10;&#10;"

Similar in theme to Goa with mechanics like Puerto Rico and El Grande but with a map, limited combat, some secret movement elements.&#10;&#10;The time is the late 1500s and the domination of the Spice Trade is in the balance.  Far from playing colonial powers, the initial countries sent Factors, or professional trader-agents, to live with native peoples, and manage their trade interests while the fleet returned home. These factors lead dangerous lives, and the success of the next fleets&rsquo; mission usually lay in their hands.   The factors built warehouses, or factories, to house goods collected while fleets were gone, and they were under constant surveillance form the un-trusting locals.  Whether you use brutally repressive means against locals like the Portuguese or Dutch, or more congenial methods like the English you must develop a strategy that lets you maximize your profit while minimizing your losses. Factors of Spice allows player the flavor of the spice race managing fleets, trading with natives, and vying for political influence in these far away tropical islands that changed the course of world history.&#10;&#10;Players act as Portugal, Spain, Holland or England.&#10;&#10;Each turn is simple:&#10;1. Take 3 cards from Tier I Deck containing simple ships, crews, and characters.&#10;2. Take 2 cards from Tier II containing advanced ships and characters&#10;3.  Buy a Special Card&#10;4.  Increase income&#10;5.  Buy an Influence Card (worth 2-4 VP at games end) but 1 is lost per attack!&#10;&#10;3 Years-8 seasons (turns)-and the game is over!&#10;&#10;Interesting Mechanics:&#10; Players can have up to 5 distinct fleets on the board and may fission and fusion at will.&#10;1. Players build a hand and &quot;launch&quot; a fleet of as many ships as they have.  Fleets are secret until they land in the East Indies or are moved into by a separate fleet. &#10;2.  Resources &quot;bloom&quot; and then rot a few turns later, creating interesting timing problems. &#10;3. Types of resources: harvest, mine, or delivered-different mechanism for each.&#10;4.  Value increases the longer a good has not been returned to Europe!&#10;5.  Diplomat Characters used in East Indies area control for VP at end of game. Seizing goods erases all diplomatic good will! &#10;6. Interesting and simple interaction with natives&#10;7.  Variable event card played each turn changes weather and conditions in the East Indies.&#10;8.  Special bonus cards that add flavor and strategic options to the game.&#10;9. Simple but interesting combat mechanism between fleets.&#10;&#10;"

If the Caller believes the Declarer then the Caller takes the cups and is the new declarer, and must declare a higher poker hand from the dice under the cups, with the player to the left as the new Caller.  Play continues until a Caller accuses the Declarer of being a liar, and the dice are revealed.

The end of war was a near reality, but when?&#10;&#10;On September 12, 1944, the Allies launched an assault with its main objective as the city of Bologna, an important center of communications in the valley of the Po river. If Bologna fell, the Allies would advance to Austria, isolating the remainder of the German armies still in Italy. Blocking one of the roads was a set of hills, and between those hills, was Monte Castello, the main objective of the 1st Infantry Division of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force.&#10;&#10;1 Large map - 6 11x17 sections (print-n-play also comes with 12 8.5x11 sections)&#10;9 Page Rules&#10;1 Tables Chart&#10;9 Page Historical Notes&#10;191 counters and 3 special counters&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/mc.htm (Portugese)&#10;Home Page: http://www.riachuelogames.com.br/english/mc2.htm (English)&#10;&#10;Print-n-Play version at:&#10;http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=570 * * * Removed from sale 1/13/10&#10;&#10;"

Dice rolls determine movement. You can jump single enemies (except uphill) and flip them over to become yours. A piece landing on the summit becomes a Field Marshal, which cannot be jumped but may leap and convert entire rows of enemies. However, there can only be one Field Marshal, whose allegiance proves difficult to retain; it must vacate the sacred peak immediately, allowing others to reach it and wrest control. Things can get hectic, but patiently blocking upwardly mobile forces in order to keep the fickle Field Marshal loyal usually wins. Still, this is a feisty game that can literally be enjoyed at all levels.&#10;&#10;"

The 12 six-month turns cover 1808 to 1814. The 100 blocks represent the military forces ofGreat Britain, Spain, Portugal, and France.&#10;&#10;Combat involves dice rolling for hits (No CRT or Battle board needed). The Supply and logistic rules are meant to model the Peninsular War adage that: &quot;In Spain large armies starve, and small ones get beaten&quot;. Winter attrition in the wrong areas can be brutal. Control of areas is key to victory and the French player in particular will contend with conflicting needs of garrisoning key areas while maintaining a sufficiently strong field force.&#10;&#10;The map covers Spain, Portugal, and southern France at about 35 miles to the hex. Depicted are the various provinces (rated for political and supply value), the major rivers, mountain ranges, and the key fortresses and towns. Each turn represents 6 months of real time (12 turns in game) and is broken down into Event, Operations, and Administrative phases.&#10;&#10;The wooden blocks represent the major military formations that took part in the war generally depicted as Spanish field armies, French divisional and corp sized formations, Anglo-Portuguese divisions, and British expeditionary forces. Leaders include Wellington, Moore, Soult, and even a special guest appearance by Napoleon himself. Special blocks include Major guerrilla formations, The Lines of Torres Vedras, Popham's Naval Squadron, and key fortress garrisons.&#10;&#10;A set of 30 event cards allows for random events, historical chrome, and political background. They also help regulate the various nation's force levels in the game. A sampling includes: &quot;The Convention of Cintra&quot;, &quot;Supreme Junta&quot;, &quot;The Emperor Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Russian&quot;. War. The game also includes 30 operations cards.&#10;&#10;The game has a 12 turn Campaign game scenario, a five turn short game scenario, and a set of optional rules that provide more chrome or can be used to favor one side or the other.&#10;&#10;Go to www.justplain.com for the publisher's website.&#10;&#10;"

It simulates not only the (narrow-gauge) railroads in that area, but also mines and other plants. Mining in the Harz mountains suffered a major crisis in the end of the 19th century and the theme of the game is to end this crisis by connecting the mines and other plants to the railroad network - and of course by proper management of the 7 public railroad companies, 15 private mining companies, and up to 5 public mining companies.&#10;&#10;1873 has a bunch of fundamental differences from the usual 18xx game, which makes it one of the more distant members of the family (most prominent are the totally different systems of train operations, route determination, and revenue calculation).&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The game presents an interesting dynamic. Mines are static and need rails to move product.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 15 independent mines struggling with horse drawn delivery. Rails are just beginning to extend track through the difficult terrain with weak and puny engines hardly better than horse drawn wagons.  What do you invest in? The rails or the mines?&#10;&#10;Soon however some mines are connected and the profits begin to roll in. But not very efficiently for the mines as they are too fragmented and cannot get good prices for their product. The mines then join forces into mining companies. The mining companies pay better then the independent companies but have limited capital. Do you continue to reap Okay revenues or take it public. Public mining companies move quickly to acquire additional mines from their owners who reap huge profits.&#10;&#10;New rail companies are also forming but have to struggle with purchasing routes and difficult terrain. But the mines need the track so once connected to the mines, they start turning a profit. But how do they protect their market or extend and try to expand to new markets?&#10;&#10;Some may fail, overextended by mismanagement and greedy owners. Others with prudent management and extended routes can reap huge profits for the shareholders.&#10;&#10;"
