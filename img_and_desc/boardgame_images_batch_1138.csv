Whilst this game is not a &lsquo;narrative driven&rsquo; game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. The Missions allow the Player to invent any kind of back-story they like in order to enhance the feel of the game. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player always has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their Tank to these Events.&#10;&#10;The Fields of Normandy 2 (the sequel to The Fields of Normandy) is set in Normandy, France in 1944 and reflects loosely the conditions and situations faced by the US VIII Corps of the United States Army as it pushed inland as part of Operation Cobra. The fighting was intense and incredibly violent. German units were very well dug in and protected by artillery and mines. In the game, you will be controlling small groups of soldiers from a platoon, consisting of three Rifle Squads, a Machine Gun Team, a Bazooka Team and a Mortar Team. As the platoon Lieutenant, it is your job to command these squads and teams in order to clear the German defensive positions.&#10;&#10;The aim of this book is to present two clear, accessible, and quick to learn war games, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the Missions can be played in around an hour and the game provides plenty of 'replayability'.&#10;&#10;This games in this book are solitaire hex and counter style wargame.

Full colour 'Mission Maps' are included. Methods to play the game include:&#10;&#10;     Cut out or copy the counters provided on the final page of the book, stick them to card and cut them out with a good quality craft knife or pair of scissors.&#10;     Photocopy the maps and draw/write on the pages lightly in pencil and erase when necessary. You can use any annotations you choose for the units, that make sense to you.&#10;     Lay the book flat (it&rsquo;s well-bound, it can stand it!) and use cubes, miniatures, or similar tokens for the units.&#10;     Use some kind of acetate and dry-wipe markers.&#10;&#10;&#10;Take a photo of the maps on a tablet and use the &ldquo;edit&rdquo; function to draw and erase.&#10;&#10;"

Once a player is out of cards, they pick up the cards they lost with, turn them over to a different rank range, and continue playing.&#10;&#10;At the start of the round, players bid for how many points (not tricks) they will take. These bids must be formed by the sum of two cards, numbered 0 to 7.  A player also has the opportunity to play one of these two bid cards to a trick.&#10;&#10;Players earn points for hitting their bid exactly and will otherwise lose points. The person with the most points after a number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;"

An example is the 18th April 2023 article &quot;How Long Should Ukrainian Forces Defend Bakhmut? Lessons from Stalingrad,&quot; by G&aelig;lan Hanlon on West Point's Modern War Institute website.&#10;&#10;This seemingly conventional hex-and-counter combat-odds-resolution game is both operational and (intra-city) more tactical with different scaled maps for each.  Unit level is battalion to brigade.  No airpower which has been neutralized in the war but artillery including HIMARS and Russian long-distance glide bombs are present, and there is fortification - albeit flank-able - to mitigate those.&#10;&#10;But the added dimension of the game is the expertise levels of the units, their promotion and/or reinforcement/replacement, and the (tragic) human - ergo political - loss factor which can disrupt or even conceivably halt the fighting and the game - a deliverance reversal of the &quot;sudden death&quot; game mechanic, if you will.&#10;&#10;There are promote-able conscript and then/also regular army units for both sides.  On the Ukraine side there are the hardcore political Azovs and also, starting in 2023, NATO-trained units of initially unpredictable strength.  On the Russian side, there are promote-able &quot;cost-free&quot; convict/prisoner units and the mercenary Wagners.&#10;&#10;Units are hidden until attacking or attacked.&#10;&#10;The game could have as many as 6 players: on each side a northern operational player outside the city, the city battle commander, and the southern &quot;outside&quot; operational player, but there will have to be some authority established as to who gets reinforcements/replacements and artillery ammunition use or stockpiling.&#10;&#10;The game has relatively simple combat mechanics (albeit having a wave-attack opportunity) and lasts 16 half month turns from the start of October 2022 until the battle's &quot;historical&quot; end ... right now (May 2023).&#10;&#10;&quot;Whether the Ukrainians choose to keep it going after having lost the city is ... right now ... problematic.  Hopefully, it will have convinced everyone of the intolerable human cost and futility of continuing the war.&quot;&#10;&#10;Well, the Ukrainians *have* chosen to resume the battle as part of their offensive and have pushed the Russians back significantly on the northern and southern flanks, so I have added a Continuation Battle of 10 more turns on the Turn Record Track with a suggested order of battle/setup.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The recommended point is the gameplay that can be enjoyed not only by science high school students, but also by university students and humanities!&#10;In Organic President, each player uses his or her hand to cause a reaction, and the game progresses by moving around on a map (reaction path diagram) that summarizes chemical changes. In other words, the more you play the game, the more you learn about the reactions of organic compounds! ! I'm tired of studying, but I can't even play... For those of you who are serious, I recommend Organic President!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;"
