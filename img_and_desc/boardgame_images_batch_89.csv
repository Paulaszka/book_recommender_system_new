The name we give to one of the truly decisive campaigns in history; whereby the sons of the French Revolution under the command of emperor Napoleon Ier, meet and utterly destroy the heirs of Frederick the Great.&#10;&#10;Five scenarios span the opening engagement at Saalfeld through the French victories of Jena and Auerst&aelig;dt. The Campaign Game opens with the French exiting the mountains of Franconia and Thuringia in a drive on Leipzig, hoping to knock the Saxons out of the opposing alliance. Their cavalry probes ahead. They have no idea where the Prussians are, or their Russian allies. At the same moment Brunswick directs three Prussian armies to drive across the supposed French line of communications. As flank guards skirmish, the veil is lifted. Both sides find their armies abreast one another heading in the opposite directions! It is a race to see which army can adapt to the new circumstance quickest. Napoleon has the edge, and it is what separates warfare of the 18th and 19th centuries from one another ... La Batallion Carre!&#10;&#10;With Jena, like its predecessor L'Arme&#195;&#169; du Nord: the Belgian Campaign 1815, players can come to full grip with the game in less than 12 pages of rules. The playing surface varies by scenario and can be one, two or three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps in size. Jena also includes 1 and 1/2 sheets of the most elegant, state-of-the-art playing pieces today.&#10;&#10;"

The cards are like standard baseball cards, but have four trivia questions on the back, labeled single, double, triple, and home run.  The game proceeds like a game of baseball, but to determine the result of an at bat, the batter spins a spinner, which would say out, or one of the four hits.  If they spun a hit, they would have to answer the question on the back of the cards to see if they got the hit.  As with real baseball, there are three outs to an inning, and 9 innings.  The player who ends with the most runs wins.&#10;&#10;"

The game play has two phases: inhabiting and conquering. In the first phase each player deploys its pieces (knights) one at a time. In the second, players take turns to conduct an attack.

The fox player tries to remove all of the geese from the board by jumping them.  The geese player tries to prevent this from happening by pinning down the fox so that it cannot move.&#10;&#10;The game of Solitaire can be played on a Fox &amp; Geese board, and some sets include additional markings for playing Asalto = Siege.&#10;&#10;There are some claims that Fox and Geese is related to an earlier game called Halatafl, but there is as yet no concrete definition of what exactly this game was or how it was played.

Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to invasion, but the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942.&#10;&#10;Hostilities began on 13 June 1940, with an Italian air raid on the base of 1 Squadron Southern Rhodesian Air Force (237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF) at Wajir in the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya).

By early 1941, Italian forces had been largely pushed back from Kenya and Sudan. On 6 April 1941, Addis Ababa was occupied by the 11th (African) Division, which received the surrender of the city.
