In each of nine rounds, you choose a card featuring symbols, properties, and borders that appeal to you, then overlap that card on your existing island, trying to create different sources of harmony that will affect its value.&#10;&#10;The game features three intermediate scoring rounds in which players choose which sources of harmony they will convert into points and when. Timing is crucial because each source can be scored only once. Whoever best keeps an eye on fishermen, birds, and volcanoes; maintains the balance between island residents and natural resources; and gains the most harmony points will win.&#10;&#10;Atua includes expansion materials &mdash; resident and fate tiles &mdash; for additional scoring opportunities, as well as a solo variant in which you play against the imaginary opponent Tahuma in one of four levels of difficulty.&#10;&#10;"

On a turn a player rolls three dice and chooses two of them to designate an uncontrolled space, which they mark. Rerolls are done if necessary and rolling triples lets a player take any open space.&#10;&#10;When a player takes a space adjacent to spaces they already control, they score points based on the number of such spaces. When all spaces have been marked off the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

One player plays with four pennies and a nickel showing heads, the other with four nickels and a penny showing tails.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player moves any one of their coins any number of unoccupied spaces in any direction.&#10;&#10;The object is to form a line containing exactly three pennies and no nickels; the pennies do not have to be adjacent, and at least one must belong to the opposing player.&#10;&#10;Variants are given involving different winning conditions and sets of coins to use.&#10;&#10;"
