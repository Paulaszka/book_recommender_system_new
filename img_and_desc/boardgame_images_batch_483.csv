The single most popular variant in North America, it's also the least well documented. Prior to the publication of this book (A Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg, Elaine Sanberg, 2010), you could not find anything about the American game in bookstores. Instead what you would have found is descriptions of various modern regional variants, the classic Chinese rules (still played today in Europe), or the rules played in  Australia or the United Kingdom. Modern American rules, and especially strategy tips, were simply nowhere to be found (Sandberg, Tuttle Publishing, 2011).&#10;&#10;The American game of Mah Jongg differs in more than the spelling with two &quot;G&quot;s on the end. In the 1920s, when the Chinese game hit the United States, Babcock's rules and R.F. Foster's rules were largely discarded. Each group developed their own house rules and special hands.&#10;&#10;In 1937 the National Mah Jongg league standardized and streamlined the scoring system. Elements like Jokers and the Charleston which were part of various card games found their way into the game. Each year a Scoring Card of hands and rule changes is released. In 1999 the American Mah Jongg Association published its own scoring card each year and sponsors cruises and special events.&#10;&#10;American Mah Jongg is a rummylike game for four players. Players try to capture pungs, kongs, quintets, and sixtets from discards and complete hands listed in a scoring card released by one of the two Mah Jongg leagues.&#10;&#10;"

The battle was the culmination of a quarter-century of political and military maneuvering by Otto von Bismarck, aimed at enabling Prussia to supplant Austria-Hungary as the dominant state of the coalescing German nation.&#10;&#10;The battle is presented using the folio line&rsquo;s Musket &amp; Saber system: brigade-sized units, one-fifth-mile hexes, 90-minute turns, 280 counters. The Austro-Hungarian army, chastened by a week of minor defeats, was entrenched a long line covering the fortress of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. It occupied a central position facing three converging Prussian armies. To win, the Prussians must sweep the Austrians off the field (as they did historically), while the Austrians must maintain a presence on the field to justify their continued claim to political primacy. The game emphasizes the differences between the armies in doctrine, weapons and morale. The Prussian triumph was born of more than just the famous needle-gun: their infantry used flexible organization and tactics to mass men quickly at the decisive point, while the Austrians used a throwback to Napoleonic column formations due to a misreading of the lesson from an earlier engagement. The Prussian artillery is outclassed by the superb Austrian guns, but can be dangerous if used properly. The Austrian cavalry is superior as well, but horsed charges were already an anachronism. In the end the battle came down to crucial command decisions, giving both players an opportunity to win.&#10;&#10;Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters&#10;&#10;Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #275&#10;&#10;"

Use every warrior in your warband at their best, and you have good chances of winning some of the riches of Terrax.&#10;&#10;Each player has a team of mercenaries from these 6 groups : Amazons, men, elves, dwarves, orcs, and goblins. Each group has a different feel and playstyle. The goal is to conquer and exploit, on a randomly placed game board, the gold veins that will make you rich. But the fight is hard to get what you want. The tension is all around the battlefield, every place where there is gold needs to be taken, and protected. Move your characters and attack, cast spells, heal the injured, move to conquer ungarded veins... When you have enough gold, hire more mercenaries to help you fight harder, and protect more gold veins. The goal of Terrax Warriors is to take out one player after the other, until only you remain in the game.&#10;&#10;Website :&#10;&#10;http://www.darvexgames.com/TerraxWarriors.html&#10;&#10;There is now a FREE PC version of the board game, downloadable on the website.&#10;&#10;"

Your family (one of four) has a small, but steady income that should suffice to hire a few showmen to bring life to the oh-so-empty park site. As you earn more, you can afford a favor or two: the police officer is kinder to you, you can hire a migrant worker to do extra work, and you can even finagle the attention of a promoter or a journalist!&#10;&#10;The families will need to co-operate from time to time; after all, those grand attractions don't build themselves. In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!&#10;&#10;To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income. A player can never have more than five money tiles and five materials.&#10;&#10;A player then takes one to three main actions and up to five special actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a building site tile. Pay the cost of the space you cover and receive the reward shown there (VPs, materials, an additional action)&#10;    Place a showmen tile. Pay the cost in building materials shown on your player board, then place this tile on an empty space on a building site. This boosts your income (by uncovering a space) and gives you and others potential places to build.&#10;    Place a grand attraction tile. These tiles cost 2-5 materials to build and cover 1-4 spaces, each of which must have a showman tile on it. Players receive points for their showmen used or attraction placed, then the showmen are returned to the appropriate player boards.&#10;&#10;&#10;By spending two money, a player can acquire one of five character tiles (either from the supply or another player); each character provides a special action that the player can use each turn, such as spending money or VPs for material or buying newspaper tiles (which are worth points and can be spent for an additional action).&#10;&#10;Each main action may be executed at most once per turn unless extra actions are used from newspapers or from bonuses earned by placing certain building site tiles.&#10;&#10;After one player reaches 60 VP, and each player has had the same number of turns, the game ends, with players scoring their newspaper tiles and losing points for each showman on their player boards. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

He can use these moves to move one or more ninjas. If he moves a ninja into a square occupied by an opponent, a battle ensues. Each player rolls a die for his ninja. Higher level ninjas roll better dice: a 1-star ninja rolls a six-sided die, a 2-star ninja rolls an eight-sided die and a Soke rolls a twelve sided die.

The first player of team white announces the general question for the first player of team black to answer. Before the specific questions are read, a die is thrown to determine which of the two teams (the active player's own team or the opponents) has to guess how many correct answers the active player will be able to give. The number of points gained by the active player's team is determined by both the number of correct answers and by how close the team's guess were. (The system for point allocation is a bit complicated; the game comes with a cardboard dial for determining the number of points.) Then the next player in team white has to answer questions and so on, until one of the tams reaches a  previously established numbers of points (40, 50 or 60 points).&#10;&#10;Question cards come in three different types: &quot;for all ages&quot;, &quot;young players usually have an advantage&quot;, and &quot;more experienced players usually have an advantage&quot;, which allows the players to adjust the level of difficulty.

Joker cards also come in three different types: one allows you to pass on your question to a different member of your team (the &quot;I'd rather you answer&quot; joker), one allows you to take over a question from a member of your team (&quot;I'm an expert in this area, I want to answer this&quot;), and one allows all the team members to answer a question together.&#10;&#10;"

It uses the interactive electronic tiptoi&reg; pen (sold both separately and in combo packages with games).&#10;&#10;The players (or player, as this can either be played cooperatively or solo) are detectives. They are trying to stop Professor Mad, who is wreaking havoc in several places in town (professor's laboratory, zoo, museum, TV studio, open-air concert stage, toy store, detective's headquarters, fast-food restaurant). In order to stop him, they have to complete assignments in all these places. If a player completes an assignment, he/she earns a medal. If an assignment fails, Professor Mad gets the medal instead. The players win if they have more medals than the professor at the end of the game.&#10;  &#10;The electronic pen is used to discover the main game board and the eight location boards. Tapping components with the pen triggers an audio explanation of the components, and the pen also tells the players the English words for the objects whose depiction they have tapped. An info button triggers hints and rules explanations. The pen also functions as a game master and a die: when all players have registered their player tokens, the pen chooses a start player. The active player taps his token with the pen, and the pen tells him how many spaces to move. It also announces three locations as the current targets for assignments. If a player reaches one of these locations, he takes the corresponding location board and tries to complete the assignment. Assignments include things like tapping a correct number or color code, or musical instruments. All the instructions are given by the pen and the players have to associate the English words they hear with the corresponding pictures. When an assignment is completed, the pen announces a new target location. (There are always three active locations, and all eight locations are used in every game.)&#10;&#10;"

The other player (or team) then has to find out this information by making guesses, also consisting of a suspect, location, motive and method. After each guess, they are told how many items they got correct, but not which.&#10;&#10;If the guessing player (or team) solves the case within seven attempts, they score points.&#10;&#10;After each round, the roles are reversed. The first player to reach a pre-determined amount of points wins the game.&#10;&#10;This is the travel edition of Murder Mystery Mansion. It uses magnetic tokens instead of cards. Other than that, the main difference is the size: this travel version has four suspects, three locations, three motives and three methods. The regular version has six of each, and the guessing team gets twelve rounds to solve the crime.&#10;&#10;"
