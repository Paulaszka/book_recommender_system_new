The four engines start at the sheds and must get to the station around the various lines and branch lines. There are three principle junctions and here may stand (in imposing black) the ample figure of The Fat Controller (the worthy Sir Topham Hatt). Engines may not go down the line blocked by The Fat Controller. However, a player whose engine lands on a yellow space (of which there are a number) must move The Fat Controller to another junction. Coming at a strategic moment this can send one's opponents off around a loop-line. There are also a number of spaces with special effects; 'Throw Again' and (very popular this one) 'Send any engine back to shed' are examples. Movement is regulated by a dice roll. Engines may pass each other but may not occupy the same space.&#10;&#10;Undoubtedly a popular feature of Thomas the Tank Engine is the four little engine models executed in excellent detail in the predominant colour. The wheel arrangements are correct although it must be remarked that James The Red Engine (who is, you will remember, a Mixed Goods engine) lacks his tender. The four engines provided are Thomas, Percy, James and Toby, and the only complaint among my nephews was that there was no Gordon, Henry or Edward (I'm a Troublesome Truck man myself). Naturally I had to point out that the game board dipslayed Thomas' branch line, not the main line where extremely important engines would operate. I felt there was a ground swell here for an expansion kit.&#10;&#10;Among its intended market the game is a great success but it is too simple other than for tinkering with by older gamers. Although, having said that, I have noticed it is a popular game for visitors to take down and play about with.&#10;&#10;"

14406,,"A self-published game that shares components with Dail Eireann, with both games being themed to Irish politics.&#10;&#10;From the review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:&#10;&#10;Each player is a presidential candidate, with a playing piece that moves around the map picking up votes. Movement is by die roll. My first reaction when we started to play was that there was really nothing much to the game, but by the time we were a third of the way through, everyone was clearly having to think, I was enjoying myself and my opinion had been changed.&#10;&#10;Three constituency cards are dealt face up by the board. The first candidate to visit the constituency collects the card and replaces it with another one from the deck. The object is to collect as many cards as you can and eventually an overall majority. Very much at the ``6 and up level so far. The fun again comes with the markers. When you collect a card you place one of your markers in the constituency, and on a turn when you fail to pick up a card you place one in a constituency of your choice. The effect of these is to slow down the movement of your rivals. The basic cost to move from one constituency to the next is one point from the die roll, but if you are trying to move into a constituency where some other player has more markers than you, you increase the cost by the number of markers you are behind the constituency leader.&#10;&#10;So what starts as a level field soon develops some very adverse gradients, and regional fiefdoms begin to appear. If this were the only effect the markers had, the game would still be fairly straightforward, but it isn't. Once again, this is an Irish election, and a simple majority is not enough to become president; you need an overall one. So after all the cards have been picked up and a pecking order established on the first count, votes start being transferred. When a candidate is eliminated, the votes they had switch over on a constituency by constituency basis, going to whichever still active candidate has most markers in the constituency. The effect of this is that in the later stages of the game proper you have to start making choices. Do you place markers so as to impede your rivals, or do you start planning for the count? And if the latter, whose switches do you aim for? What looked easy at the start isn't any longer.&#10;&#10;"

As each answer is read aloud, players record the name of the individual whom they believe correctly matches the response.  Correct matches are rewarded with points, which advance players around the board. &quot;Super Bitch&quot; cards add an element of chance&mdash;they can fast-track a player either forward or backwards. Which Bitch is Which? is a great party game that rewards perceptive observation and cunning responses.&#10;&#10;"

Just as in real life, one issuer may sell more than one bond issue, each of which might be insured by a different insurance company.  The 36 different issuers have different probabilities of default, with riskier issues represented by dice faces with numerically higher values. Riskier issuers pay higher premiums to their insurance company, but also have a greater chance of defaulting and causing the insurer to pay a claim.&quot;  Most money at the end wins.&#10;&#10;The box claims the game is for ages 14 and up, but it's more straightforward than that.

In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Players start off following some &quot;initial rule set&quot;, and gameplay occurs in clockwise order, with each player taking a turn. In that turn, they propose a change in rules that all the other players vote on, and then roll a die to determine the number of points they add to their score. If this rule change is passed, it comes into effect at the end of their round. Any rule can be changed with varying degrees of difficulty, including the core rules of the game itself. As such, the gameplay may quickly change.&#10;&#10;Rules are divided up into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules (called transmuting) before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones. A rule change may be:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the addition of a new mutable rule&#10;     an amendment to a mutable rule&#10;     the repeal of a mutable rule&#10;     the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable&#10;     or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable&#10;&#10;&#10;The game can be played around a table with written notes, or online through mailing lists or forums. Alternative starting rulesets exist, particularly for online and postal games which don't suit the usual clockwise turn order. Several games have been running online for over a decade.&#10;&#10;"

There is a treasure chest in the center and 4 'betting corners' - one with a picture of a pistol, another with a picture of a cannon, another a trumpet and the last a sword. The chips come in white (worth 1 pt.), black (2 pts.) and gold (3 pts.). The die faces for each die show one each of the 4 betting corner items, a treasure chest and a map (which acts as a joker).&#10;&#10;Object: To be the last player with chips.&#10;&#10;Distribute the chips evenly among the players.

If all three are the same betting item, take all chips from the corresponding betting corner and your turn is over. If the roll has different betting items, you can set aside one kind and re-roll the rest. You must put one chip (value 1) on each betting corner that corresponds to the face of a die you will re-roll. (ex: You roll a cannon, a sword and a trumpet. You choose to keep the sword, pay 1 pt to the cannon corner, pay 1 pt to the trumpet corner and re-roll.) As long as you don't win, you can continue to pay 1 point to the appropriate corner(s) for each die re-rolled. Once you have three of the same betting item, take all chips on that item and your turn is over. For each treasure chest rolled, every player (including you) puts 1 point on the treasure chest. You can stop rolling and pass at any time. A player who runs out of chips is out of the game.&#10;&#10;"

For example, if the player batting presses the #2 button, and the player in the field presses the #4 button, the Strike lamp would light up, while a combination of #6 and #4 would result in the triple lamp lighting. Each player also has A and B switches that are pressed to light the Safe or Out lamps needed for the results of some plays (like if a runner tries to steal 2nd base).
