The race begins...&#10;&#10;&iexcl;Adios Calavera! is a tactical race between the living and the dead for two players, one controlling the dead, the other the living. Each player has eight pieces and sets them up on a edge of a roughly 9x9 board next to the edge of the opposing player. Players are thus not directly opposite each other, but seated at a right angle. The first player to get their eight pieces off their opposing side of the board wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move one of your pieces. A piece has as many movement points as pieces on the line where it is standing orthogonally (i.e. at a right angle) to the main direction towards your goal. This includes all pieces: both your own and your opponent's, including the piece being moved. Some pieces also have special abilities, such as moving through obstacles, switching with other pieces, or taking additional movement.&#10;&#10;"

Otherwise you discard and redraw your hand and the game goes on.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#172;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#230;&#133;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#172;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Some of the mini games include:&#10;&#10;Card Battling: where playing cards you have collected can be used to fight with other players with the goal of stealing presents. &#10;Avalanche: where you can roll a snowball in an attempt to knock down a player's piece - allowing you to take their presents. &#10;High-Low Bridges: where you must correctly guess the next card to be turned.&#10;The Dark Cave: close your eyes and try to get through the cave with your presents.&#10;Present Throwing: throw your presents to the catcher piece on the mini-game, each catch gets one of your presents across the frozen lake.&#10;Snowman Sleigh Ride: roll a ball to knock down at least 3 snowmen to make it to the bottom and continue with the game.&#10;Interactive Player Challenges: move away from standard board game etiquette and complete a Christmas themed challenge to enter the North Pole.&#10;&#10;The game, its goal, challenges and quests exist to put you and your fellow players in the spirit of Christmas whilst providing a fun and rewarding gaming experience. We are now working on the song play-list to go with the game.&#10;&#10;"

It is designed to help people imagine and think critically about the future. Players take on the roles of distinct characters, each with their own 'Job of the Future' and unique set of preferred future conditions. They compete to create a world where their future job is relevant and secure.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Up to 5 players choose from 10 &quot;Jobs of the Future&quot; with differing back stories and victory conditions. They draw and play cards from a deck of 100 Impact Cards that relate current technological trends to future conditions. They assess and discuss the likely primary and secondary impacts of each card on one or more of 10 different &quot;domains&quot; (e.g. Manufacturing, Energy, Security, Home, Work) and place or remove influence cubes. &#10;There are also Disruption Cards that indicate large-scale or sudden shifts in the system that pose larger challenges to the players. &#10;After each round of play (every player has had one turn), players collect the played cards and generate the &quot;Headline of the Era&quot; from player suggestions.&#10;When a player sees that the number of influence cubes equals or exceeds the win condition on three of the domains specified for their &quot;Job from the Future&quot;, they reveal their role and win the game.&#10;&#10;This game was originally designed by Idea Couture in collaboration with Policy Horizons Canada, an organization within the Public Service of Canada that examines emerging policy challenges and new ideas and questions posed by trends in technological and social development.&#10;&#10;There is not a great deal of strategy or mechanical challenge in this game, but that's not the point; the purpose of the game is to get the players thinking and discussing the possible second-order effects of current developments, using their logic to persuade other players on what other domains could be affected besides the obvious ones. &#10;This game appears to be aimed at wannabe policy analysts, amateur futurologists and soi-disant speculative thinkers generally.&#10;&#10;"

231350,,"A board game for 2 -4+ players based on the TV show Lost Girl.  Players move their pawns around a circular track collecting the tokens needed to solve a central mystery and its complications.&#10;&#10;The board is a circular track with 12 spaces around which players move in a clockwise direction.  The spaces on the board allow players to gain tokens, or draw cards from the various decks.&#10;&#10;There are six token types each representing one of six traits: Guile, Lore, Search, Heart, Fight, Magic&#10;&#10;There are 3 common decks of cards:&#10;&#10;Mystery Deck&#10;&#10;       Each card represents a mystery that must be solved or resolved. To solve a mystery a player must collect 3 of each token type, plus extra tokens required by individual mysteries and complications.  An individual mystery card lists any extra tokens required in addition to the 3 of each type. When a mystery is solved, the solving player keeps the card and a new card is drawn from the mystery deck to be the new mystery. &#10;&#10;&#10;Complication Deck&#10;&#10;       When a player lands on the complication space on the board, they draw a complication card. This card is placed face up next to the board.  This card lists extra tokens that need to be gained to solve the current mystery. This additional burden applies to all players.  When the current mystery is solved, these cards are discarded. &#10;&#10;&#10;Assistance Deck&#10;&#10;       When a player lands on the assistance space, they draw an assistance card. This card gives that player one or more extra tokens. The assistance card is then discarded. &#10;&#10;&#10;To start the top mystery card is placed face up in the middle of the movement track. Players then take turns with each turn comprising 3 phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move Phase&#10;         Roll 1 die and move that many spaces clockwise along the track. &#10;    &#10;     Action Phase&#10;         Most spaces when you land on them give you 1 or more Tokens. &#10;         If you land on a Deck space, draw a card from the indicated deck. &#10;         If you land on an opponent&rsquo;s Pawn, steal 1 Token of your choice from him.  Skip all other actions you would take at that space. &#10;    &#10;     End Phase&#10;         If you have enough of the right tokens to solve the Mystery and all of its complications, declare your intent.

This game combines bluffing, hand management, and your ability to be a jerk in one tidy package. In a round, each player starts with a hand of five cards, with the cards being similar to a Pairs deck (one 1, two 2s, up to ten 10s), but with some of the cards from 1-5 being labeled &quot;low&quot; and some from 6-10 being labeled &quot;high&quot;; if a card isn't labeled, then it can be anything from 1-10.&#10;&#10;Each player reveals one card simultaneously, and whoever reveals the highest card starts. On a turn, the player choose one card from hand, places it face down with 1-3 honey chips on it, then draw a new card. The next player can either place the same number of chips on it to pass the card to the next player or take the card and chips; if the card matches a number the player already has, they are out of the round and must ante a number of chips equal to the card number to the pot. If no one takes the card, then whoever first played the card must take it, scoring lots of chips but killing themselves if they played a number they already had.&#10;&#10;The round continues until a player has cards that sum to at least 35, they have three cards valued 1-5 in front of them, or they're the only one still in the round. That player wins the pot, then everyone scores points equal to the number of honey chips they have. After a certain number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"
