Thus men's turn may consist in chained jumps. &#10;     If more than one capture move is available in a player's turn then it is obligatory to select the capturing move resulting in capturing the maximum amount of the opponent's pieces (men or kings).&#10;     If optional chained capturing might capture same amount, the player may choose.&#10;     Men are non flying. Thus they can only capture an opponent's piece adjacent to their own position. &#10;     Kings are flying. They may move over any amount of empty fields or capture a piece in any amount of empty fields' distance away as long as the adjacent field behind the captured piece is empty. Anyway if a king captures, it may land on any empty field immediately behind or following empty fields in straight line of the captured piece unless it is required to stop on a specific field in order to continue jumping according to the rule of capturing maximum amount of opponent's pieces.&#10;     Any capture move may be performed by men or kings in any direction - forwards or backwards.&#10;     Each jump is performed in a straight line over any single opponent's piece. The adjacent field behind the pieces captured must be free.&#10;     A possible chained jump can consist of single jumps having a combination of same or even different directions.&#10;     In a chained capture move opponent's pieces are removed only after capturing is complete.&#10;     During a chained capture a piece may not be jumped more than once. But it is allowed to revisit or jump over any empty field multiple times then.&#10;     There is no breezing as a penalty for captures that are not performed.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The battlefield/scenario section includes 8 scenarios and 2 terrain layouts. Games can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version. In the basic version, designed for younger players, characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized or eliminated. The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;Each unit has a movement rating in hexes. Combat is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card. Extra hits count as wounds (figures may have more than one wound).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario. It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;"

A Record Sheet is made out with values for each Leader and Warband involved in a game.&#10;&#10;Initiative is determine by use of cards from a conventional card deck.  Each player is assigned a card number or suit, adding a card for each Warband under a player's control.  Additional cards can be added to reflect additional events or participants in a given scenario, for example, the random appearance of a traveling Lord or Bishop and retinue.&#10;&#10;Dynamics of play involve Morale, Courage, Agility, Terrain, Non-Warband Movement, Shieldwalls and Wedges, the use of ships, and Mounted forces.  Information is provided for Saxons and Normans as well as Vikings, and the system is also adaptable to other peoples with whom the Vikings interacted, including Picts, Arabs or Skraelings (Native Americans) with a little historical research on the gamer's part.&#10;&#10;The game is well suited to multiplayer games, each player handling one or more Warbands of anywhere from six to twenty or more figures on the table.  Game length is dependent upon the scenario design, from swift ship-to-ship fights to extended coastal raids or open-field battles.&#10;&#10;The game is enhanced by the inclusion of a random events card deck which adds variety and surprises to play.&#10;&#10;Unlike many sets of miniatures rules, Strandhogg can be enjoyed by players owning only a few dozen figures; an average Warband might number ten to twelve figures, and three Warbands compose a raiding force under a Noble.  The rulebook is sprinkled with sidebars featuring excerpts from the Norse Sagas for flavor, and also includes optional rules for special attributes or traits to individualize Leaders or leading warriors (for example, a warrior surnamed &quot;the Stout&quot; gains +1 on Defense; &quot;Leg Biter&quot; enjoys a +1 on Offense).&#10;&#10;Players will often find themselves identifying strongly with the fortunes of their warband and even individuals within it; although Strandhogg is not a role-playing game, it deliberately strives to impart a strong flavor of its Viking focus.&#10;&#10;Web address: STRANDHOGG@rochester.rr.com&#10;&#10;"
