On the second you must shoot down Martian saucers that multiply and descend to raze your crops. Finally you must send shuttles back to Earth, through the Martian blockade, to the third board where you sell your produce and buy upgrades. The language-independent game boards are double-sided with slightly different scenarios on each, giving eight different game setup possibilities.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Although this turns out to be incredibly interesting and allows for millions of different scenarios, plays, and manipulation, KAM&rsquo;ON has many other aspects and cards that give it a quite perfect balance between fun, complexity and possibilities. For example, take poker, a game that is not too complex yet allows for so many different plays on account of the player/human factor of the game; players can manipulate others, bluff, etc. KAM&rsquo;ON is very similar, although frankly our cards look a bit nicer.&#10;&#10;Having tens of distinct cards lets the player combine different plays, playing as many cards as they  would like during their turn, yet only playing one card per type. The true intrigue comes when you realise that you may not make it without trading- or scamming. You decide to bluff. You lie about having a card that another player needs only to scam him out of a card you need. A player may only complete their part of the trade during their own turn, therefore it is quite easy to scam someone- at the cost of your in game reputation.&#10;&#10;This aspect of KAM&rsquo;ON works perfectly with the beautifully designed cards that work to get you your 4 organs- the cards needed to win. In all honesty, KAM&rsquo;ON is quite simple. Do everything you can to get 4 organs, whether it be destroying your opponents and stealing their organs, or scamming them out of their organs. Whichever it is, as long as you get an organ, it was probably worth it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

269689,,"User summary&#10;&#232;&#159;&#187;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#141;&#132; (ARIZIGOKU) is a Japanese abstract game for two players. (In English it would be Antlion Pit and the Romaji could be read as ARIJIGOKU). The game was produced with help from DIY &#229;&#141;&#147;&#229;&#177;&#139; (DIY Takuya), the manufacturing section of a board game circle named &quot;Play Space Takuya&quot; based in Sapporo, Japan. DIY Takuya helps by making game boards, components and organizers using laser-cut wood.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player game of ARIZIGOKU, you try to save members of your faction from the Antlion pit.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, you are assigned one of four factions. Member tokens are scattered in a concave pit-shaped game board. Each member belongs to two factions, inscribed in each side of the token.&#10;&#10;You have three actions each turn. By spending an action, you move your rescuer pawn to save a member, or move a soldier pawn to force a member fall one tier. If a member falls to the bottom, that member is lost.&#10;&#10;You win the game when you save a certain number of members of your faction. You lose the game when three victims of your faction fall into the bottom of the pit. (Other conditions may apply.)&#10;&#10;This game has two modes: basic game and standard game. In the standard game, there are Antlion turns in which the Antlions may capture members actively.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#159;&#187;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#141;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#183;&#163;&#231;&#169;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#183;&#163;&#231;&#169;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#159;&#187;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#141;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#233;&#163;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#160;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#150;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#166;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#141;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;"

Players have a few weeks to secure their place in Corinthian lore as its most savvy trader!&#10;&#10;Corinth is a roll-and-write game akin to a dice-only version of the board game Yspahan. At the start of a turn, the active player rolls nine dice, then places all the dice with the highest value on the gold space at the top of the chart, then starts placing dice from the bottom of the chart up, with each value of dice being on a separate level.&#10;&#10;The active player takes all the dice on one level, then the action associated with that level. The top level gives the player as many gold as the number of dice they took; the bottom level gives goats instead of gold; and the middle levels allow a player to deliver goods to a number of market stalls on their personal player sheet equal to the dice claimed. (You have four colors of market stalls, and once you start marking off, say, rugs in one of the blue areas, you have to finish marking off all the rugs in that area before you can start marking off another blue area.)&#10;&#10;The active player can spend gold to roll up to three extra yellow dice and thereby increase the odds of getting to take a desired level; if the active player doesn't take any of these yellow dice, they are removed from play, preventing others from benefitting at that player's expense.&#10;&#10;Instead of marking off gold, goats, or goods, you can use the value of the die or dice claimed (1-6) to move the steward on your personal score sheet. The steward starts in the middle of a 5x5 grid on your sheet, and you must move it as many spaces as the number of pips on the die value claimed, not crossing over any line you've drawn previously. You can pay 1 gold to move the steward one more or one fewer space, and you can pay as much gold as you want to do this. You can receive gold, goats, or goods from where the steward stops, but beyond that, you can earn points. When the steward stops on a corner space of this grid, you count the number of spaces circled to this point, with some spaces counting twice, then you write down that number, scoring that many points at game's end. If you stop in another corner later, you do the same thing again, which compounds the value of all your previous movement.&#10;&#10;You can spend gold or goats to construct buildings that give you bonus powers, such as collecting two additional gold whenever you collect any gold or moving the steward up to two spaces more or less without paying.&#10;&#10;After 16 turns (with four players) or 18 turns (with two or three players), the game ends and you tally points for goods delivered, spaces visited by the steward, buildings constructed, and goats and gold still on hand.&#10;&#10;"

Cards may be rotated, but not flipped over, and a player may choose to cover other cards or place their card next to others.&#10;&#10;As soon as someone creates a chain of five identical lizards either orthogonally or diagonally, the game ends and the player who owns this color of lizard wins.

Will you be able to outperform the other homesteaders?&#10;&#10;Each player in Nevada City starts the game with a nuclear family &mdash; mother, father, daughter, and son &mdash; and a homestead mat where you can establish farms, fence in livestock, and develop silver mines. You start the game with one mine, one farm, and one ranch, along with some money and an assortment of commodities. The town consists of a few buildings, and other buildings will become available for construction as the years advance, with the game lasting four years.&#10;&#10;A year lasts a number of turns until all players have used all of their characters and hired workers. On a turn, a player chooses one of their characters and takes actions until all of that character's actions are spent; a character can't take the same action during a turn. A character can buy new property from city hall; mine, farm, or ranch their own property; claim a building; construct a building; use an existing building; reserve a contract that has conditions for improving the city; or work to fulfill that contract. Each character and worker has a different set of skills that can boost the actions they take, such as finding additional silver in a mine or bringing lumber to a construction site.&#10;&#10;You earn victory points (VPs) for constructing buildings, in addition to fees from those buildings when other players use them. You earn VPs for completing contracts as well, with those contracts having different values depending on which buildings are in place at the time. Each player receives a private goal card at the start of the game, and all players score points for these goal cards based on how well they do relative to other players, so pay attention to their choices.&#10;&#10;Each year, various events pop up, leaving players to suffer drought or reap the benefits of fertile land, among other things. At the end of a year, workers leave unless you marry them into a family, which will require spirits and other resources.&#10;&#10;Nevada City also includes advanced rules that add additional buildings and events to the game, a gambling subgame of sorts, a more volatile production market to make life in the West less predictable, and extra sons and daughters. On top of all that, the unhired workers at the end of a year get rowdy and start shooting up the town, so you need to use your gunslinging abilities to bring them to heel and try to avoid getting wounded since you might lose out on a character's abilities in the subsequent year.&#10;&#10;"

And a little bit of negative interaction.&#10;&#10;In the box (nicely finished in matte), you get a 4 page instruction, a board with 57 squares, 4 cardboard pawns (with plastic clip-on bases), 50 &quot;Musician&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Music piece&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Musical instrument&quot; cards, 50 &quot;Event&quot; or &quot;Occurrence&quot; cards, 18 &quot;Concert&quot; tokens, 18 &quot;Golden treble clef&quot; tokens and a six-sided dice. The goal of the game is to get 5 &quot;Golden treble&quot; tokens (or 3 in the shorter game variant). &#10;Players actions consist of a dice roll, movement (either clockwise or counter clockwise), and performing the action listed on the space of the board (kind of like in Talisman  ). The board spaces consist of actions like: draw a card from indicated pile, gain or lose a token, use a shortcut, exchange a card with other player and so on. The &quot;Event&quot; cards change the course of the game. You can use such card as soon as you draw one, or leave it for later (depending on the card). Example: &quot;Thanks to your hard work, the orchestra will play at a festival abroad. You get a 'Concert' token&quot;. &#10;&quot;Music piece&quot; cards should be matched with &quot;Musicians&quot; and &quot;Instruments&quot; - for example &quot;Music piece: Chopin - Prelude in E minor. Instrument needed: piano&quot; -&gt; you have to find a musician who plays piano, like &quot;Miss Wanda. A piano expert&quot;, and a &quot;Instrument&quot; card with a piano. One musician can often play more than one instrument, but there's a twist: for example you can get a pianist, but he only plays one composer's pieces, or he doesn't play Chopin's or Mozart's or someone's music. &quot;Instruments&quot; cards (50 cards, but 16 types of instruments) include some technical/historical info; &quot;Musicians&quot; cards are quite funny in polish. If you get 3 such matching cards (music piece, musician, instrument), you get a &quot;Concert&quot; token. Then you have to get to a &quot;Practice room&quot; field on the board (there's two of them; roll a dice or use a shortcut).
