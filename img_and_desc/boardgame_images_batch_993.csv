Be the first to arrange tiles in such a way that an unbroken line of your chosen color connects the outer tiles of the (three-by-three) grid. You will be placing, replacing, switching, rotating and blocking tiles during play. It is a puzzle to solve and a race to solve it first.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing tiles on an imaginary invisible grid of three by three (3x3) with the goal of connecting the lines on the tiles. You want to connect the lines of your color around the outer edge of this imaginary grid. And at the same time preventing your opponent from connecting theirs.&#10;&#10;As you place a tile, if there are tiles on the table, you must place it adjacent to another tile, horizontally or vertically. As soon as there are three tiles in a row or column, this sets the outer limits. The end result should be a three-by-three square of tiles.&#10;&#10;As you play, you could do other actions instead of placing a tile, like rotating a tile, switching place between two tiles or replacing a tile. In addition to these four actions (placing, replacing, rotating and switching) you may always lock a tile at the end of your turn. You do this by placing your player marker onto the tile in question.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first to have an unbroken line of their color connecting all of the outer tiles of the grid.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The corners of the four tiles must match each other when they go into the large frame.&#10;&#10;A players turn consists of two parts: completing frame(s) and scoring.&#10;&#10;To complete their frames, a player either 'draws' two facedown tiles from the tilepile or 'swipes' one faceup tile from another players uncompleted frames. A swiped tile gets a 'swipe token' put on it to keep it from being swiped by another player. Each player only has two swipe tokens to work with, so be judicious on the swiping.&#10;&#10;Scoring is done once a frame has all four tiles placed in it. That makes it 'complete', and the tiles become un-swipe-able. The player moves their completed frame to the center of the table to corner match with other frames already in the center. The numbers in the center of the matched edge do not need to match, but there is a bonus if they do. Once a frame is moved to the center, any swipe pawns are retrieved by the player to be used again later.&#10;&#10;The game is over at the end of the turn when the tilepile is emptied. Each player subtracts one point for every tile infront of them in uncompleted frames. High score wins.&#10;&#10;Strategy hints:&#10;Generally it is better to draw than swipe unless you are completing a frame.&#10;&#10;If you are way ahead on points, it is better to draw down the tilepile to bring the game to an end.&#10;&#10;Frames are scored on the corner numbers, so when possible put your higher numbers in the corner of the frame.&#10;&#10;Always be building your frames with an eye on the frames in the center of the table. It does you no good to complete a frame if there is no place to put it and score.&#10;&#10;There are six of each of the eleven unique tiles. Towards the end of the game you can look around to see whether the tile you really need is still in the tilepile, or whether you need to swipe it from another player.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The battle was fought between the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte and a larger allied army composed of Austrian and Russian forces. The battle is considered to be one of the most important and decisive engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. The engagement result brought the War of the Third Coalition to an end and about the Treaty of Pressburg. The battle is widely thought of as a tactical masterpiece on par with Cannae.&#10;&#10;The game system of The Pratzen: Austerlitz, 1805 began some three decades ago as an idea to update the SPI Tactical wargame Grenadier, published in 1971. Pratzen evolved into a merger of the Grenadier scale with some different combat mechanics based on the original von Reisswitz Kriegsspiel rules of 1824, adopted as a training tool in the Prussian army after the Napoleonic Wars. The scale was shifted from half-battalions to companies and divisions as the basic infantry maneuver piece, and much additional streamlining and simplification ensued.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
