It includes 72 tiles, consisting of 63 tiles released in the original base game, 6 from Inns &amp; Cathedrals, 1 from Traders &amp; Builders and 2 from King &amp; Scout. It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.&#10;&#10;Nineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.&#10;&#10;Play of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.&#10;&#10;The German edition of this game includes a book Carcassonne -&nbsp;Das Schicksalsrad by Helene Luise K&ouml;ppel.&#10;&#10;The English edition of the game was released in October 2009 by Rio Grande Games.&#10;&#10;Part of the Carcassonne series.&#10;&#10;"

We have designed it to be both reflective and representative of electionary politics as they operate today. Each facet has a relevance and significance to the &quot;real&quot; game itself, and our only alteration is to have injected a sorely lacking sense of humour. Enjoy and be entertained.&quot;&#10;&#10;As from the blurb this is a game of politics set in Australia with players attempting to win the election by securing a majority in the House.&#10;&#10;The Board is a large circle with a series of concentric circles within representing different city &amp; county constituencies. At the center is a grid representing the House, with a Hereditary Seat space at the center of this.&#10;&#10;Players roll die to gain a number of move points used to move vote blocks around the board in an attempt to gain control of seats.&#10;&#10;Players can also pick up &quot;Contingency &amp; Complication&quot; cards to add some variety to the game.&#10;&#10;"

After years of procedure, surveillance and undercover work, Johnny Gota, the Godfather of the biggest crime syndicate in the &ldquo;Big Apple&rdquo; has been arrested and faces 246 charges ranging from simple extortion to homicide.&#10;&#10;After what promises to be an explosive trial, the Don will probably end up in a locked subterranean cell for 23 hours a day for the rest of his life.&#10;&#10;He's made it known to his faithful lieutenants that if he gets off scot-free, he'll retire and leave his place to whoever takes the best care of the Family's business while he is away...&#10;&#10;For the Made Men, the message is clear: corrupting the jury, bumping off witnesses, and bribery will decide the verdict of the trial! Not only that, the race for honor has also begun!&#10;&#10;But to some, power isn't earned &ndash; it's taken!&#10;&#10;The players play the role of the Boss' lieutenants, who are supposed to manage the Family's business and plot to get their leader cleared. But turncoats hide among them, people who want the Boss to be found guilty just so that they can lay claim to the Family by force, or because it's their job as undercover FBI agents!&#10;&#10;Nostra City is a fictional-reality game starring a New-York crime syndicate as it appears in Gangster movies: a cruel and violent world where, under the cover of a tradition of silence and loyalty, everything is allowed.&#10;&#10;"

Now, players of The Red Dragon Inn, The Red Dragon Inn 2, The Red Dragon Inn 3, and The Red Dragon Inn 4 can play out an actual round of gambling when they play the &quot;Gambling? I'm In!&quot; card! Even better, the gambling games also can be played on their own as standalone games, or as part of your RPG, or LARP. The game will come with a 93 card Rogues and Warriors Deck, a bunch of 6 sided dice, coin tokens, debt and loan tokens and rules for at least 7 games! Some of the games use dice. Some of the games use cards from the Rogues and Warriors Deck, and some of the games use dice and cards.&#10;&#10;This card deck was developed as a stand-alone game as well as a possible replacement to the gambling component in Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 90 cards. The deck is broken down into three colors (rust, green, and blue) with 6 different symbols. The card faces feature 1 Knight, 2 Ladys, 3 Bards, 4 Merchants, and 5 Rogues per card symbol. There is a die symbol on each card with a number of pips equal to the number of cards of its type and a set of symbols on the right that denote character superiority in certain game variations. Some games with this deck involve 6 D6 dice (not included).&#10;&#10;There are five base games included and are as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rogues and Warriors - Similar to two card poker, each player is dealt two cards. You compare these two cards to the symbols on the right to determine how powerful your hand is.&#10;     Threes - Uses all dice, no cards. &#10;     Jack of All Trades - Uses 5 dice and only the Rogue and Warrior cards. The theme is putting your workers to work and using the cards and dice to complete jobs.&#10;     Den of Thieves - No dice. Hands are dealt and players use the special abilities of each character to influence hand weight and scoring.&#10;     The Wheel (and The Clock) - No dice. Players try to guess what cards others are collecting in order to gain points and win the round.&#10;&#10;&#10;When combined with The Red Dragon games, when a player plays the &quot;Gambling, I'm in!&quot; card, the player may decide to choose any game from the list to play instead of the normal gambling rules. Special rules are included for each variation when combining this with the normal game.&#10;&#10;There will be other variations available as Slugfest has invited players to create their own games with the deck and the ones deemed best will be included in later rules updates.&#10;&#10;"
