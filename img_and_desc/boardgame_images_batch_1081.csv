A simple and effective hidden movement system allows players to really sweat as they try to work out if it's safe to cross that open field in front of them. Plans don't usually survive contact with the enemy, and a number of mishap tables help to create a narrative experience that goes beyond your average &quot;move and shoot&quot; wargame.&#10;&#10;Boocoo Fire Mission is aimed at 6mm or 15mm miniatures, and can be played on a 4' x 4' or 6' x 4' table.&#10;&#10;This game is company scaled, and the smallest maneuver unit is the squad, with players generally controlling 2 - 4 platoons, each with a number of squads and an HQ.

Vehicles such as the M113, M48 Patton, M551 Sheridan, various marine &quot;amtracs&quot;, the M42 Duster, and M50 Ontos are also covered.&#10;&#10;Boocoo Fire Mission is has a descending level of detail, with infantry as the most detailed unit in the game, followed by helicopters, and finally vehicles. Infantry can hide, dig in, crawl to avoid opportunity fire, and conduct suppression. Helicopters have detailed damage tables to provide for many interesting results from fire, and can drop off and pick up infantry on the table. Vehicles can disembark their crew, leaving sentries behind to man a single weapon, and can also transport infantry.&#10;&#10;Army lists are provided for ANZACs, ARVN, US army, Armored Cavalry, Mechanized companies, and US marines. VC and NVA are of course included, and some factions are split into different time periods depending on if their equipment evolved over the course of the war. Boocoo Fire Mission covers the entire Vietnam War, from early ARVN vs VC skirmishes in the early 1960s, through to 1975. Specific city fight lists are also included for both the Allied and Communist forces, to allow players to play battles such as those in Hue or Saigon.&#10;&#10;The game provides printable markers, and a printer-friendly version of the rules is also provided.

You like it or not you cannot leave anything on your plate to go to waste, you have to eat it. The overly nice kitchen ladies keep the extra portions coming and your evil school mates try to get rid of their collection by tossing it on your food pile.&#10;&#10;This is an easy to understand quick and fun card game. Each card has a color and a food on it. You start with three in your hand, no cards in your food pile, and one card in the common discard pile. The goal is to have less cards in your foodpile than the others when the deck runs out. In your turn you can play cards from your hand or your foodpile if the color or the food mathes the top card on the discard pile. You can continue playing cards until you don't have any that matches or you decide to stop. Kitchen staff, classmate and school pet action cards help you to get rid of your food pile, often by giving cards to other players.&#10;&#10;"
