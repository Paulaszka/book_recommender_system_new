Each player has 12 game pieces in her own color, which start off the board; traditionally one player uses small sticks, the other uses pebbles.&#10;Players initially take turns to place ('drop') one of their pieces on the board.  Each must be dropped on an empty space on the board.  One source states that this must not be adjacent (orthogonally) to a friendly piece, but the original descriptions by Monot [1950], translated by Murray [1951] only state that - during this stage - no player may form a row of three of her own pieces.  If a player cannot make a legal drop, she must pass. This continues until all pieces are placed on the board, or until no more pieces can be placed.&#10;After that, in each turn and starting with the player who began the game, each player moves one of their own pieces to an empty adjacent (orthogonal) space on the board. If, by so doing, she is able to make an orthogonal  row of exactly three of her own pieces, she may capture one enemy piece (of her choice, presumably).  The player who captures all of her opponent's pieces wins the game, and scores two points if this is achieved without any of her own being captured, or one point if she has lost at least one of her own pieces.  A series of matches is played, and the series is won by the first player to score 10 points.&#10;&#10;"

If the card is answered correctly the card is kept, if not it is returned to the box. The most cards held after ten minutes decides the winner. Cards are real photos of players, with extra information like how many caps the player has, the year of their International debut and what shirt number they wear. Hard core fans can put their knowledge to the test--especially if their powers of observation let them down. The game is presented in a smart cube box and is a perfect gift for Man U fans who already have everything.&#10;&#10;"
