In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;"

A spinner is employed for movement. Moves are made in a straight line, forward, backward or sideways, but not diagonally. The point of the spinner corresponding in color to the player's knights indicates the number of moves the player may make.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to get as many knights as possible into any of the other players' castles, and also to score by capturing the opponents' knights. A capture may be made by a player spinning a number that will land his knight directly in a space occupied by an opponent's knight when not on the gold field or in a castle. Knights may be passed or jumped at any time but they are safe from capture on the gold field or in a castle.&#10;&#10;The winner is determined by the score of points. For each knight captured the player scores five points. For each knight moved to opponent's castle the player scores 15 points. The game can be played to conclusion, even though one or two players may be eliminated.&#10;&#10;"

Each card shows the animal image on one side and has stats about that animal's weight, height/length, longevity and number of offspring on the other. Each player starts the game with three animal cards in hand, and the category tokens are placed in a circle with a shared pawn on one token.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, she throws the dice tokens, then moves the sum of the pips being shown. If she lands on a regular category token, she can use the side showing &ndash; say, &quot;longevity, oldest&quot; &ndash; or flip the token to the other side &ndash; which might be &quot;offspring, fewest&quot;. Each player then chooses a card in hand and reveals it simultaneously. The player whose animal best fit the category places that animal card before her and draws a replacement card. Everyone else returns their card to hand.&#10;&#10;If the player lands on a continent or animal token, she chooses a specific continent or animal type as well as one of the four animal stats and whether players want to be high or low. Each player then chooses an animal card and reveals, with the winning player(s) placing that card before them and drawing a replacement. (A player can swap out an entire hand of cards, but must sit out the next challenge.)&#10;&#10;The first player to have five cards before her wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
