The game requires creativity, as players have to figure out a way to implement the new cards in the story. The game also requires concentration and memory, because the players have to remember the whole story in correct order, as they have to recite the whole thing from beginning to end, every time a card is added.&#10;&#10;If a player makes a mistake - forgets something, tells things in wrong order - the card they drew is removed from the game. That element won't join the story. It also means a loss of a point, as the number of cards collected during the game determines the winner.&#10;&#10;A little wooden cat moves forward on a track towards a castle which marks the end of the game. Some spaces on the track have special effects that remove cards from play or exchange them, changing the story. Some spaces let you draw a card, but the next player has to tell the story.&#10;&#10;"

You will find that the battle tactics used by the warring nations throughout the period covered by these rules were taught to all officers under the huge shadow cast by Napoleon. With the army lists provided towards the back of the book there are additional rules for the conflicts in which these armies took part.&#10;&#10;Napoleonic doctrine would be present at every battle to 1865 and the end of the American Civil War: Johnny Reb and Billy Yank were part of Napoleon&rsquo;s Legacy&hellip;.

To develop your civilization, you must distribute, collect and share resources with other players. But if the players overexploit the resources and develop too quickly, they impoverish the land, the water will rise and the play area will get smaller.
