The catch is that the stupid humans have not only placed it in a maze but also that the maze keeps changing. Nevertheless, you want that cheese, even if it means that you have to face dangerous traps. Beware, there are other mice in the maze as well and they may trick you to leave the cheese in their nests instead.&#10;&#10;For each cheese that you take to your private nest, you score 1 point. For each cheese that you take to a shared nest, the players of the adjacent private nests score 1 point each. The player with the most points when all cheeses have been taken or no more actions are possible wins.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 7x7 maze tiles, of which only the central one (the Cheese Chamber) is turned face up. The players start with 1 maze tile each. Each turn, a player does the following:&#10;&#10;1. Move your mouse as far as you can along the path. In a nest, you may choose not to move, and in the Cheese Chamber, you may choose through which exit you move.&#10;2. Move marbles as far as they can along the path. Marbles are traps that return mice to their nests and cause them to lose 1 turn.&#10;3. Replace a maze tile anywhere in the maze by placing the one on your hand face up. If the maze tile you replace is turned face up, the next maze tile you replace must be turned face down.&#10;&#10;When you leave the Cheese Chamber, you take a cheese, and when you enter a nest, you leave the cheese there, even if it is not a nest of your own. If you are hit by a marble, the cheese is left in the maze, and if you pass another mouse, you exchange whatever you carry. If you move out of the maze, you return to your nest and loses one turn while the cheese is returned to the Cheese Chamber. If the path is a loop, neither mice or marbles move.&#10;&#10;The combination of free placement of maze tiles and forced movement through the maze creates a strong take that mechanism. Not only can you prevent other mice from finding the cheese but you can even force them to take it to your own nest. When you place a maze tile, each other player gets to place a maze tile so you must be very careful when moving in the maze!&#10;&#10;"

Whether they tell tall, short, fairy or scary stories, this fast-paced game will be a best-seller for children aged six upwards who have a vivid imagination, a competitive streak and are quick thinking. The Story Telling Game is a great birthday and Christmas gift and it not only encourages creativity, but it will keep children entertained on rainy days and school holidays. Created for budding Jackanorys, The Story Telling Game sees each player start with five words on their cards and when the clock starts, the first players starts telling a story using one of their words. Then it's the turn of the next player who has to incorporate one of their words into the former player's story... and so it goes on with each player adding to the story with one of their words at a time until the buzzer declares that it's 'The End' for the player who's talking when the buzzer sounds. When this happens, the player has to pick up all the cards used by the other players and begin a new story, this time with the opening 'Twice upon a time'. The story doesn't have to win awards or be a work of literary genius - it can be about anything but has to include one of the words on each of their cards. The Smiley Trump card adds a twist to the game as it can be used as any word and if a player is caught out by the buzzer, the Smiley Trump means they get off scot-free and the next player has to collect all the cards.&#10;&#10;"

The remaining cards in their hand are then drafted to the next player, so players build up a picture of which therapies might offer a cure as the game goes on. Therapy cards range in value from 1 to 6 and can only be played if any player has played the card below it (i.e. playing a four requires a 3 in that therapy in play) and then game ends when one or more 6s are played in a round. Players work together, trying to cooperatively generate enough evidence for a cure, but not everyone will win - only those who have backed the right cure will be lauded, or everyone might die!&#10;&#10;"

In the ensuing battle, the power liberated by the combatants ignites in a combustion that shatters the Earth. In the ensuing deflagration, the weakest gods are obliterated, rendered down into the small fragments of power that constituted their being. The stronger ones were able to resist total annihilation but even their prodigious power could not save them entirely. As the survivors fell from the broken mountain, the shards of their divinity and the remnants of those that did not survive were scattered to the 4 corners of a now broken world.&#10;&#10;As they awoke, each god found themselves to be but a shadow of their former selves. They were still mighty, stronger than any mortal that yet walked but they were no longer all powerful, no longer immortal. Each one could sense the fragments of power that had now fallen to the Earth and that by collecting these they could regain their former grandeur and, if they could but amass enough, stand at the front of a new Pantheon, reshaped in their image.&#10;&#10;The world around them suffered as much as they did, the power released during the epic battle had ignited a cataclysm that reduced the beautiful land of Greece to a barren wasteland. Athens burns, Crete has sunken below the waves of the roiling seas and the immortal mount Olympus is now an ash covered wreck of its former glory. But this Event has not only affected the mortal realms. The underworld trembled from the blow even as a legion of fresh souls ran down the river Styx. Would that have been the extent of the underworld's involvement however...&#10;&#10;Hades, having lost the majority of his power, no longer holds sway over the Underworld. The gates of hell are open and even though the River Styx prevents the weakest souls from regaining the mortal world, the strongest warriors, the mightiest heroes and the most vicious monsters have managed to claw their way back up the Styx and back to the surface.&#10;&#10;As a new power struggle breaks out, Gods summon mortal survivors, returned heroes and reborn monsters to their side in their hunt for the shards of their lost power.&#10;&#10;In Mythic Battles: Pantheon, it is these clashes between warbands, in the midst of a post-apocalyptic ancient Greece, that are the focal point of the game.

Players draw and discard their way to an empty hand, laying down a variety of cards designed around a medieval theme. Each deck comes with 72 cards and supports a game of 2-4 players. Included are 48 Medieval Unit Cards (4 Colored Factions: Blue Cross, Green Star, Red &amp; Gold, and Purple Chevron).&#10;&#10;In addition to the 48 Unit cards, there are 16 Wizards (4 different classes for each colored faction), and 6 Plague Cards. Plague Cards do not belong to any color; therefore, they cannot be discarded, ONLY PURGED. Plague Cards were created to prevent you from getting rid of all your cards. There are several ways to remove these cards from your hand (see Wizard Cards). Part of the fun is discovering these various methods of &quot;purging&quot; the Plague.&#10;&#10;Wizard Cards are played in the same manner as the other Colored Units. For example, a Blue Wizard can be played on top of any Blue Unit or on top of any other Wizard. There are four types of Wizard Cards, each with their own unique action.&#10;&#10;Swap-A-Hand Wizard - When you play this Wizard, swap your hand with the hand of another player. The choice of which player to Swap-A- Hand with is yours. Once the &ldquo;swap&rdquo; has occurred, play continues to the next player in turn.&#10;&#10;Draw Two Wizard - When you play this Wizard, the next player must draw 2 cards. The player who draws the additional cards will still be able to play their turn. If they do not have a playable card after Drawing Two, they must continue to Draw until they draw a card that can be played. A turn is determined complete when a card has been played.&#10;&#10;Purge-A-Card Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ANY card of your choice from your hand. Place the card of your choice facedown on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. The card has now been PURGED.&#10;&#10;Purge-The-Plague Wizard - When you play this Wizard, you may discard ONLY Plague Cards from your hand. However there is no limit to how many Plague Cards you can discard. Place the Plague Card(s) face up on the tabletop, thus removing it from the game completely. *The two &quot;Purge&quot; Wizard cards are the ONLY cards that can remove Plague Cards from your hand and therefore the game. Also important is the ability of the &quot;Purge-A-Card&quot; Wizard to remove ANY card from the game. The ability to remove Any card allows various opportunities to develop. In fact, sometimes the best play might not be to PURGE a Plague card. The choice is yours...&#10;&#10;"

The game is published in a Japanese / English edition.&#10;&#10;In the game, the player starts with one hand card, then draws a second. From these two, they play a card to the tableau. Cards are played touching, in columns left or right but shifted halfway up or down. In the one-player game, a column is restricted to 4 cards, in the two player, the limit is 3 cards. Alternately, you may exchange a played card with a hand card. But next turn, after drawing, you must play down two cards so your hand is back down to one before drawing.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards are played, cards are turned face-down if any card on its right is of a lower number. Then the player tries to find paths in the tableau from the far left to the far right side. Think of this as telling the story. Any cards that are not part of a valid path are also turned down.&#10;&#10;Now you score for colour groups, and deduct points for face-down cards and gaps in the tableau. After keeping a column, shuffle the deck over and play a second round to get your final score and the King's opinion!&#10;&#10;For two players, it's the same--with both players working a hand of two cards each. You cannot consult about which card to play, but after choosing, you may confer about placing. The final score this time reflects a test of your friendship.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&quot;You shall be rewarded if your tale amuses me.&quot;&#10;&#10;The eccentric king issued the edict to all over the country. You are a bard who is willing to take up that challenge. You have to make up a tale by mixing stories in the world and enchant the king with the tale.&#10;&#10;With 22 beautifully illustrated tarot cards with four background colours, this card game demands you make a succession of tough decisions. You will be excited to see how the storyline barely keeps consistency.&#10;&#10;Basically, you play a card from two cards in your hand each turn. When you have played all cards, the first round ends and you score according to the card positions. With some of these cards remaining in play, the game proceeds to the second round in the same way. The total of two rounds is your final score.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:

Whenever this is rolled a punishment will be dealt. Who will receive this punishment is decided by spinning an Olympic torch. What the punishment is can be decided from game to game.

One card is placed in the center of the table with its characteristics revealed. Players then take turns placing a card from their tableau in a row on the table; a player can place a card between any two other cards. After placing the card, the player reveals the characteristics on it. If the card was placed correctly &ndash; that is, with the particular characteristic in numerical order compared to all other cards on the table &ndash; the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck and adds it to her tableau.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all her cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play.

The diabolical Doctor Necreaux has captured the world's top scientists and forced them to build a Doomsday Device. Your mission: Explore the Doctor's secret island lair, find the scientists, and escape in your shuttlecraft before the island is blown to Kingdom Come!&#10;&#10;In this simultaneous action game, players take one turn together as a team. At the start of each turn, you decide whether you're exploring or resting. When you explore you declare a speed, which represents how quickly you're exploring the island adventure deck and determines how many encounters your team will attempt to resolve this turn. You want to draw as many cards as you can because the scientists are hidden somewhere in the middle of the adventure deck, the escape shuttle is hidden in the bottom, and you have a limited number of turns before the island blows up. However, you can't be too fast or you'll fall prey to one of the island's many traps. If you choose to rest, your team gets to heal up and recharge.&#10;&#10;The Island of Doctor Necreaux incorporates creative ability manipulation (in assessing how player powers interact and applying them appropriately), press-your-luck (when selecting a speed and during combat), and resource management (deciding when to use charges - a scarce resource that fuels agent powers - and when to use a turn to rest instead of explore). The game comes with quick start rules and multiple variants to increase replayabiliy and adjust thr difficulty to accommodate a wide range of player skill. The island and agent skills are all card-based, making the island and the agents different every time.&#10;&#10;We at Invisible City are excited about the improvements in the second edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All-new full-color art.&#10;     Almost all cards have their own unique art.&#10;     Full-color art on card fronts and backs.&#10;     More &amp; better components. Bigger box (with room for expansions), better cards, bigger rules, enough dice for all players to play, etc.&#10;     Quick-start rules to make it easy for first time players to play.&#10;     All-new &quot;secret cache&quot; cards to adjust the game for different skill levels.&#10;     Clearer/better ways to increase the difficulty for experienced players.&#10;     All cards are numbered for easy set-up of pre-generated scenarios.&#10;     By popular BGG demand, the game's been re-tooled to use 2d6 as the primary resolution mechanic (instead of 1d6). The rules and every card have been re-written to accommodate this.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Now the greatest animal coaches from around the world (the participating players) have gathered for the ultimate test of their training prowess to see who will become The Champion of the Wild.&#10;&#10;Three events are first selected - one from each of five different categories (speed, power, endurance, technical and team). These events can be any measurable activity, examples including the 100m sprint, high jump, ballroom dancing and hide-and-seek. Players are then dealt a hand of animal cards to choose from and must select one single animal to represent them across all three events, competing against the animals selected by the other players. These events are then played out by way of animated discussion and players then vote according to their opinion on the likely rankings (excluding their own animal when voting). Votes score points for the appropriate players and the player with the most points after three events wins.&#10;&#10;The Champion of the Wild combines the fun and laughter of a conversation-driven social game with the challenge of strategic thinking required for animal selection and event tactics.&#10;&#10;Who will be your champion?&#10;&#10;"

Witches!!!As one of the club&rsquo;s supernatural enforcers it is the players' duty to conduct a witch hunt and capture as many of the coven as they dare.&#10;&#10;Ghost Hunter: Witches  is a card game for 2 or more players (up to 6 with one deck or 12 with two decks). Players must lay down higher and higher Witch cards until one can lay a set of three capturing all the cards on the table at that time. A player who cannot keep up with the witches being laid will be forced to pick up the stack and add it to their hand. Every captured card is worth points at the end of the game. Many cards have special rules that effect the order of play, who may capture or other game dynamics. Some cards are marked as 'innocent' meaning that if they are captured, which is often unavoidable, they are worth minus points at the end of the game. When the first player has gotten rid of all of their cards the game ends, then the player who has the most positive points wins overall with the others being ranked behind them based on their scores.&#10;&#10;The deck can be integrated with all the other Ghost Hunter decks like the blues Spirits deck or the red Vampires deck.&#10;&#10;So assemble your trusted associates, light your torches and prepare for the wickedness of Ghost Hunter: Witches.&#10;&#10;"
