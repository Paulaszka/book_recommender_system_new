If the fish ends its move on a swishbone, then the swishbone is added to the tail of the fish.&#10;&#10;A move can be anything up to the complete length of the fish, so longer fishes have more movement.&#10;&#10;Strict fish building rules mean that players have to plan their routes carefully, or risk penalty points by giving their fish indigestion.&#10;&#10;Specialised swishbones offer special attacking and defensive options.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no free swishbones, and players score 1vp for each piece in their swish, less 1vp for each penalty point.&#10;  &#10;Swish is created for the Nestor minigames competition:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/461867&#10;&#10;"
