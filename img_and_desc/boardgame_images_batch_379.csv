The game contains:&#10;&#10;     one rulebook (24 pages)&#10;     one playbook (20 pages)&#10;     one single sided map&#10;     two countersheets (280 counters)&#10;     three player aids&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         News 2/3/2010&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Nuklear Winter is no longer a Print &amp; Play game as it is in re-development to be produced as a game for Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC. under the title Nuklear Winter '68&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as Nuklear Winter '68."
