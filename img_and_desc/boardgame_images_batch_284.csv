Victory consists of capturing or sinking all enemy Merchant Shipping so that the enemy is completely blockaded and cannot obtain further supplies from Neutral sources.&#10;&#10;The Map shows four countries (two sets of paired enemies).  The land war between them is considered to be locked in a Maginot Line type of stalemate so the battle hinges on the war at sea.  The map has 32 ports (5 in each warring country and 12 on the coasts of the neutrals).&#10;&#10;Each country has a different starting mix of units (for example Leoland is high in Naval Formations and Adlerreich has the most submarines).  The player round consists of moving all your cargo ships 1 space then rolling the dice and moving your units. A player may make a single air attack instead of moving any naval units.  The air units have unlimited range and the number required to make an attack is based on the target.  Losses are also based on the target and are automatic (for example it takes 4 air units to attack a naval formation and 2 air units are automatically lost).&#10;&#10;A merchant ship can join a naval formation and create a convoy for more protection. Naval combat consists of a surprise attack (by submarines) and open attacks between naval formations.  The surprise attack can be triggered by a roll of 8 or higher and an open attack requires the player to spend 1 or 2 pips of the dice roll.&#10;&#10;"

Far off to the west a great unknown wilderness was opening up. North America was being conquered and empires were being built.  Today in the game Conquest we re-enact the conquering of the continent.&#10;&#10;It is a game in which keen judgement interspersed with dashes of bluff and audacity mingle with lady luck to create a game that on one is out of until the last hand is played.&#10;&#10;The purpose of the game is to conquer as many of the 50 states shown as possible.  States must be conquered in the order listed under &quot;Order of Conquest&quot; shown on the game board and are also one of either four colors and have a number associated with victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There are four phases to the game - 1) Bidding your hand, 2)Marking of conquered territory and distribution of groups, 3)Dealing new cards, 4) Additional conquest.&#10;&#10;In the bidding phase, players bid on their hand of five cards. First player is to the right of the dealer and then in subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand starts the bid.  Starting player places a bid.  Bids cannot be higher than $5 million.  The remaining players can either pass, meet the bid or raise the bid.  Winning hands are determined in order of winning hierarchy: Single: Highest single card of color called for; Doubles: Two matching number cards, one in the color being called; Triples: Three matching number cards, one in the color being called; Sweep: All four cards of the same number.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, the winner of the hand takes all money bid and places one of their markers on the state or states conquered, receiving the number of regiments of troops as indicated on the conquered state.  5 regiments = 1 division.  Only divisions can be placed on the maps in any territories the players owns. Players may redistribute any troops that he possesses for the purposes of defense or offense. Players can also purchase additional troops.&#10;&#10;In the third phase, the dealers asks if everyone is ready for the deal.  The dealer hands out enough cards to bring all players hands up to five cards. If a player receives a money card they can immediately turn the card in to collect the cash and gets another card.&#10;&#10;In the final phase, players may conquer states of their opponents. Starting with the player who won the last hand states can be conquered via the following rules: 1)State must adjoin the territory of conqueror and belong to an opponent 2) Must have more troop divisions that place being conquered 3) Player must pay bank sum of 10 million plus 5 million for every divsion that opponent has in the conquered territory (Max 40 million) 4) Only one state can be conquered per hand 5) Conquered troops are returned to opponent and 6) if conquests results in a complete territory being possessed than additional troops are obtained for the district.&#10;&#10;To conclude the game: After all states have been conquered there is a final phase of general conquest until no one has any resources left to conquer with.  The winner is the player having the highest score by totaling the victory points associated with the states conquered.&#10;&#10;"

At the beginning of the game players pick one of the six great countries as their home country.  They get one Diplomat, 10 consulates, 5 soldiers, 1 bomber and 1 battleship.  The battleship and bomber are placed on the home country flag and all the diplomats are placed on &quot;Start&quot;.&#10;&#10;The mechanic of the game consists of movement around the path of flags via the roll of dice (doubles get a second roll). When a player lands on a colony he places a soldier, a second landing on the same colony gains a consulate and the Country Flag card.  Landing on an independent country gains an immediate colony.  Soldiers can be captured if another player lands on a colony before a consulate is placed.  Players can move across the Bridge of Flags if they land on one of the two Neutral Countries, doing so gains the player a battleship or bomber.  The battleship or bomber can be used to gain a strategic location flag if he owned when he lands on a strategic location. Normally players can only move clockwise but control of a strategic location allows the player to move either direction when he lands on one.  Additional game play is added via card play introduced by landing on an &quot;Isolation&quot; spot.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has placed 10 consulates.  Flags, and captured tokens are worth points and the player with the most points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Seven armies represent the seven warring states of the late Zhou Dynasty (1045 - 221 BC):&#10;Qin (white), Chu (red), Qi (indigo), Yan (black), Han (orange), Wei (green), Zhao (purple).&#10;&#10;Each army is played by one player. For less than 7 players, there are several predetermined &quot;allies&quot;, so one or more players direct two armies.&#10;&#10;Every army has 17 pieces, which makes a total of 120, regarding the central single piece, representing the kingdom of Zhou. This piece does not move at all and cannot be captured.&#10;&#10;Each of the armies consist of the following pieces:&#10;1 General - moving like the Queen in modern Western Chess.&#10;1 Deputy General - moving like the Rook in modern Western Chess.&#10;1 Officer - moving like the Bishop in modern Western Chess.&#10;1 Diplomat - moving like the Queen, too, but cannot capture or be captured.&#10;1 Cannon - like the Cannon in XiangQi (moving like the Rook, but capturing over one intervening piece).&#10;1 (Unit of) Archers - moving like the Queen, but only for 4 spaces.&#10;1 (Unit of) Crossbowmen - moving like the Queen, but only for 5 spaces&#10;2 (Units of) Swordsmen - moving 1 space diagonally.&#10;4 (Units of) Broadswordsmen - moving 1 space vertically or horizontally.&#10;4 (Units of) Cavalry - moving 4 spaces: 1 in a straight line and then 3 diagonally.&#10;&#10;There are several rules regulating possible allies and winning conditions over single states. Residual pieces of beaten armies are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Simplified, it can be said, that to gain a victory over another state, a player has to capture the general or more than 10 pieces of this state. The player with the most captured pieces at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;There are similarities both to Go (the central piece as the centre of the universe/representing the Zhou Dynasty, or the removing of &quot;dead&quot; armies) and Xiangqi  (the pieces, the armies ...); this and the 7 players make this game unique in the history of strategic boardgames.&#10;&#10;"

Each point along the track is a hole. Some holes are bigger than others. The playing pieces are circular, like a ball.&#10;&#10;One player is a cat, the others are mice. Everyone moves along the track by a die roll. The mice must escape from the cat player who has a big advantage. If a mouse player lands on one of the bigger holes then it will fall through the hole and out of the game. The cat playing ball is too large to fall through a hole so he doesn't mind which space he lands on.&#10;&#10;The cat wins if all the mice are caught or the mouse who gets to the end of the track first, wins&#10;&#10;"

The first spin selects the lane of travel.   Player 1 spins again and sets the bomber's altitude.  The nose of the bomber is placed in the metal stand provided at the height noted. A third spin gives the movement value.&#10;&#10;The AA gun spins next (2 times to set the lane and altitude).   If they match the lane and height of the bomber it is brought down.  Each player follows in succession with a bomber and then the AA gun's attack.  If the AA score a kill it gets points based on the zone the bomber is in and its altitude.&#10;&#10;The lanes contain spaces with numbers (from 1 to 14) that reference the hit on the score card. The value is recorded as part of the score.  Any plane that comes to a &quot;Change Altitude&quot; space spins the spinner for a new altitude.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all bombers have been shot down or have reached the finish line.  The player with the largest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;
