Second, the players want to complete the unfinished church La Sagrada Familia. Towards this end, each player gets a number of jigsaw puzzle pieces which they have to buy during the game. The required money is earned by trading in language cards and asset cards. The game ends when one player has bought and laid out all their puzzle pieces and also manages to correctly solve five of the language cards he/she has collected during the game.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics in more detail&#10;&#10;A die determines the players' movement on the game board. The board contains the following types of spaces:&#10;Event spaces and special spaces: The player draws a card from the corresponding stack. Event cards must be played immediately, special cards can be kept until needed.&#10;Attraction spaces: The player receives an asset card of the corresponding tourist attraction. Different attractions have cards worth different amounts of money.&#10;Language spaces: The player gets a language card, which they have to learn during the game. Each language card contains two different words or phrases in German and Spanish.&#10;Metro spaces can be used either as a shortcut to a different metro space, or as an event, special or language space (player's choice).&#10;Bank spaces: On a bank space, the player can exchange asset and language cards for money. To do so, they must have learned the language cards. During an exchange attempt, one asset card and two language cards are submitted. The German words are read out, and if the active player correctly translates them to Spanish, he/she receives the amount of money specified on the asset card. If they fail, they get back their cards and can try again later.&#10;Casa de Pledras spaces: The player can pay for one of his puzzle pieces to be added to the puzzle that is laid out on the table (all players contribute to one puzzle).&#10;&#10;"

In his/her turn, a player places a new triangle to the game area, trying to form color areas that are as large as possible. Interestingly, a triangle cannot only placed with full contact to another triangle, but also with half contact, so the game area can take a rather unusual shape. For each color area that a player adds to, a point is scored for each corner involved (including orange corners). The goal is to score the highest number of points this way.&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts with a lord, a castle and some troops in one of the villages.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, check to see whether one or more players have won, with shared wins being possible through alliances created by marriage. Winning solo is tough, so players need to negotiate, make deals and form alliances. To do this, players use their three embassy pawns; by spending a pawn, a player can have a three-minute-long private conversation with one or more other players to make whatever deals they wish. You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!&#10;&#10;Players draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord. If troops from more than one player end up in the same village, they battle until one side is eliminated or forced to flee.&#10;&#10;If a player controls all villages in a fief and has at least one castle there, he can purchase the title of the fief and assign it to a lord, with the title being passed to an heir if the lord subsequently dies. Players also try to secure the titles of king and pope, which provide benefits of their own, as well as points. Each title of fief, king or pope is worth a point, and the first player to collect three points wins. Two players win if they are allied and have a total of four points.&#10;&#10;The 2011 version of Fief has vastly revised rules with new materials and set-ups for shorter game play in addition to the long game.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Fief&#10;    Fief 2&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.&#10;&#10;Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.&#10;&#10;The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.&#10;&#10;To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player.

Be the first to find and collect the most matching parcels. Players spin the spinner to move around the board, depending on the number of parcels pictured on the square they landed on they get to turn over the same number of tiles in the middle of the board, if they get a matching pair they get to keep them. If they land on one of the character squares they get to jumble some of the tiles.&#10;&#10;The publisher says this is a memory game with a jumble shuffle twist (whatever that is)!&#10;&#10;"

Two teams of two celebrities in each team compete to answer really obscure questions but can lead to very funny and creative answers. You score very little for getting a question right but if you make a rather obvious answer, a klaxon sounds and you gather lots of minus points. The box features host Stephen Fry on the cover. The odd name for the show, QI, stands for 'Quite Interesting'.&#10;&#10;The publisher says;&#10;According to The Bible what came first the chicken or the egg? Be careful with your answer. Get it right and you move forward but a wrong answer could mean the dreaded klaxon and you'll be going backwards! The answer to this and hundreds of other obscure and fascinating facts can be found in this hilarious board game based on the QI television programme!&#10;&#10;"

Every game turn has both players taking actions. We have defense and offense represented, so you are not just at the mercy of the cards. You do not have to add to your deck each turn, so the size of your deck is up to you, and there for you are in control of how likely you are to draw the cards you need.&#10;&#10;"

Designed for those players, that enjoy strategic planning and quick thinking.&#10;&#10;QF is played using the same cards as the core set &ndash; each card has two symbols on it, there are 12 different symbols altogether. Most of the cards are identical to the ones in the core set, while others have different symbol combinations on them. The set also includes a few special text cards (action cards).&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is the same as in The Enigma of Leonardo, to collect Secret Keys, by making sequences of identical symbols but this time the game is played on one big field. The field itself is made during game play, the only restriction being its size &ndash; 5x5 cards. The first card is placed in the middle of the playing field, players then take turns at playing cards, increasing the field. In the end, the first card that was played might not even be in the middle anymore, it could be on the edge.&#10;&#10;Players can not only play cards on empty spaces, they can play cards on top of each other and can even replace cards from their hands with the ones on the playing field. The only condition is that the cards being replaced must share a common symbol. This playing mechanic allows for more complex combos, by careful planning, one can gradually replace all the cards on the field with symbols that the player needs.&#10;&#10;Just like in The Enigma of Leonardo, in QF players receive Secret Keys when they successfully make a row of cards with the same symbol. But now you can get symbols not only for 3 cards in a row, but for four and even five identical symbols. Qunitis fontis actually means &ndash; &ldquo;the fifth symbol&rdquo;, when translated from Latin. Rows can be made horizontally, diagonally and vertically just like in the core game but now you can receive the same key more than once by first making a row of three symbols and then adding cards with the fourth and fifth symbol.&#10;&#10;But it sounds much easier than it actually is. The game now uses a special counter-marker called &ldquo;veto&rdquo;. After playing a card, the player may choose to move the marker on any card (even the one he just played) on the playing field. The next player cannot play any cards that share a symbol with the marked card. It&rsquo;s up to the players to decide should they move the marker each turn or keep it in one place blocking a certain symbol combination for the entire game.&#10;&#10;Another new addition to QF are the action cards. There aren&rsquo;t much compared to another expansion of the game The Enigma of Leonardo &ndash; Novem &ndash; but they can alter the flow of the game. With these cards you can steal symbols from your opponents and prevent them from gaining new ones.&#10;&#10;The player who successfully collects seven Keys is the winner. If the deck is used up and no one has collected seven Keys, the one to collect the most is the winner. In case of a tie a key gradation has been provided.&#10;&#10;QF is basically a harder version of The Enigma of Leonardo: the rules are different but the cards used are practically identical. Meaning you can try playing The Enigma of Leonardo using QF or vice versa. It will be a slightly different game, but it&rsquo;s still possible.&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    The Enigma of Leonardo&#10;&#10;&#10;"

For instance, it might say 'Balloon' and you cannot use the words 'pop&rsquo;, &lsquo;inflate&rsquo;, &lsquo;bang&rsquo; or &lsquo;float&rsquo;?&#10;&#10;The subjects are graded so that different age groups can play.&#10;&#10;The cards are dispensed from a yellow plastic head and the cards becomes its tongue, so to speak.&#10;&#10;"
