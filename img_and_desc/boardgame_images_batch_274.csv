Or how long it takes for the tide to go out at the Bay of Fundy? Where did Perc&eacute; Rock get its name? What is the provincial flower of Alberta?&#10;&#10;These are all questions that you will find the answers to in the game TRAILBLAZER. This game is produced by the Trans Canada Trail Foundation in order to raise funds for the world's longest recreational trail.&#10;&#10;TRAILBLAZER is a four player board game that is a great way for families to spend time together. The questions are trivia based and each question card has five questions. The player chooses the difficulty level (1-5) and then the question is read. Points are given according to the difficulty of the question. There are a wide variety of topics covered in the game such as geography, history, flora, fauna, and transportation. There are also adventure and treasure cards.&#10;&#10;Related to:&#10;&#10;    Trailblazer&#10;&#10;&#10;"

But the central hill only supports a certain number of goats with food.&#10;&#10;Every card has a number from 1 to 50 and from 1 to 5 goat's heads printed on it. At the start of the game, every player receives eight cards, and eight tricks are played in one game. There are also hill cards which have each two quarters of an island with a number between 1 and 8 written on it.&#10;&#10;The player who played the highest-numbered card wins the trick and is first player for the next. However, during the first four tricks, the player who played the lowest-numbered card, adds a part of the central hill to the middle of the table, marking it with the wooden goat. After the first four tricks, the players know how many goats the central hill supports. This represents the goal limit.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who collected the most goat's heads without going over the limit dictated by the central hill. A proven strategy is to spam your opponents with the goats that you probably won't need.&#10;&#10;A variant of the game consists of playing a number of rounds equal to the number of players, and totaling the points.&#10;&#10;"

The game has been designed to ensure that, just as in reality, the commanders (you) are fully occupied with decision making from the outset. Your key objective is to outmanoeuvre the enemy army and concentrate your forces at critical points in the battle. This will then destroy the enemy's will to fight, deal a devastating blow to the morale of their commanders (your opponent) and allow you to win.&#10;&#10;Our companion army list books will contain historical overviews and the organisation of hundreds of accurately researched armies, ensuring that your battles will be able to have a realistic and historical feel.&#10;&#10;Also, in reality, some armies would be relatively small, consisting of as few as 5,000 men, whilst others would be enormous. Field of Glory will allow you to see what might have been had these forces been equally matched, using a points system, as each army can then be scaled up or down whilst retaining an individual mix and balance of troops to create &ldquo;what if&rdquo; encounters.&#10;&#10;We started with a blank sheet of paper and looked at a wide range of possible mechanisms. Some concepts are entirely new. Others may look familiar at first glance, but interact with the rest of the rules in a completely new way, giving Field of Glory a style all its own.&#10;&#10;In Field of Glory our most important objective is to make the game fun to play whilst retaining a strong historical feel.

One player will adopt the mantle of Sauron and do his best to spread his evil influence across the lands.

It is one of the first games to use the peripheral, which is bundled with the game, along with a fixed Starter Deck and 1 booster pack. The trading cards are encrypted along their edges with a CyberCode matrix code. The game can also be played without the use of the Playstation 3 system, as a stand-alone card game. However this will cut out many unique graphics and require a person to keep track of numerous scores normally tracked by a computer - mana gain/loss, health bars, element advantages, field terrain changes, etc.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing creatures or spell cards from a 30-card deck in order to control a majority (5 fields) of the 9 total fields on the playing mat which is laid out in a 3x3 grid.  Other than  controlling a majority of fields, players can also win if their opponent runs out of cards to play.  Creatures' overall effectiveness is determined by their Hit Points and Attack Score as well as any special abilities they may possess.  Five elements divide the game's units: Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Biolith.  The playing grid fields have a top and bottom side and each side is affiliated with one of the five elements.  Creatures placed on friendly elements receive HP bonuses while creatures placed on an opposite element (a Fire creature placed on a Water field) suffer a loss of Hit Points, so unit placement is important.&#10;&#10;In order to play any card (creature or spell), players must first pay a card's required summoning cost in mana (auto-generated for players every turn).  Each creature has a specific attack and defense pattern and these, along with the unit's placement on the 3x3 grid, determine where combat occurs and to some extent, how it resolves.  The extremely unique aspect of the Eye of Judgment game, however, is that when you play a card, the PlayStation Eye peripheral automatically generates that creature or spell into a 3D graphical version on your TV or monitor and it places it on a computerized version of the playing grid.  It also generates battle animations and resolutions digitally based on the cards involved or recently played.  This adds a level of visceral excitement to the collectible card game experience since you can actually see your minions battling it out in colorful digital fashion.  There isn't a single-player campaign but players can play matches vs. an AI opponent, another human, or online vs. other human opponents.  A rudimentary creature combat mode entitled Judgment allows players to determine which units would defeat other specific units in a head-to-head match-up.&#10;&#10;The Eye of Judgment provides 5 themed pre-constructed decks (Fire Crusader, Earth Emperor, Water Barrage, Wood Swarm, and Biolith Scourge) and the Starter deck that's provided with the base game (containing a variety of card types).  Set 2 is due for release sometime in mid-April 2008 and will add another 100+ cards to the game, with more advanced powers.&#10;&#10;"
