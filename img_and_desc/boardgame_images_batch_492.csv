Players choose for each question how many points they want to make and how big a risk they are willing to take.&#10;&#10;Aim of the game: Having the highest number of points after a certain number of question cards have been played (number to be decided by the players at the beginning of a game). Points are earned by correctly answering questions.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The starting player takes a card from the card stack, chooses a letter and reads the corresponding question and its answers. There are two types of questions:&#10;&#10;- Questions with one to three correct answers: For each question, there are four answers. One to three of them are correct, at least one is wrong. When all the answers have been read, the players place their chip(s) on the betting boards for the answer(s) that they think is/are correct. Each player (including the one who read the question) can place up to three chips. Players who put their chips on one or more wrong answers don't get any points this round. Players with exactly one correct answer get to advance their pawn one space, 2 correct answers means advancing 2 spaces, 3 correct answers 3 spaces.&#10;&#10;- Questions whose answers have to be put in the correct order: For each question, there are three answers. When all the answers have been read, players put their chips in the order that they think is correct (the chips are numbered 1-3 on one side). Players with all three chips in the correct order advance three spaces. Players with one correct answer advance one space.&#10;&#10;"

The Monster's movements are hidden from the Crew player behind a game screen, and the Monster's location is only revealed when the Monster attacks...or if the crew is lucky (or unlucky) enough to find it!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of play, a mysterious specimen in the cargo hold has been let loose as a result of the damage caused by a meteor collision. This SPECIMEN is in an embryonic stage and evolves throughout the game, becoming more difficult to kill as the turns progress. In addition to attempting to kill the crew, the monster can also destroy sections of the ship, forcing the human players to divide their efforts between defense and structural repair. The monster can win the game by either killing all seven members of the crew or damaging enough sections of the ship that it breaks apart. Adding the destruction of the ship as an alternate victory condition allows for varied strategies on the part of both players. The human player can use tools to effect repairs, construct weapons and trackers to hunt down the monster&hellip;or ultimately blow up the ship if all seems lost.&#10;&#10;The SPECIMEN player constructs his/her monster from a selection of 25 different attributes (offensive, defensive, or special abilities), providing new and different threats to the human player each game. This constantly changing monster, combined with 90 event cards driving game play, allows for infinite replayability. No two games should ever be the same.&#10;&#10;"

Churchill wanted to invade Italy which he labeled &ldquo;the soft underbelly of the Axis&rdquo;.

Cheat fate, act like a legend, and if the inevitable cold grave calls you - go with a bang.&#10;&#10;Each player has a character. After creating the characters, you may use the cards and the adventure-o-matic to create a grand,&#10;challenging adventure. All scenes start from a plot twist. The twists might be positive, helpful, funny or they might come in the shape of a challenge. Players respond to challenges by using cards from their hand. A player may play as many cards of the same suit as he likes, but the sum of their values must be at least equal to the challenge card&rsquo;s value in order to beat the challenge. If the character is unable to resolve a challenge with the cards in hand, the situation might call for a betrayal. A challenge from another character&rsquo;s action can kill a character, if the challenge winning player calls for it. However, challenges between characters do not need to be deadly: a character might try to seduce another or steal his hat.&#10;&#10;Pirates never betray each other, or the pirate code, Well... at least if it&rsquo;s not a matter of life and death ... Or if it&rsquo;s not about love ... Or if there is no gold in it ... Or&hellip; well, you get the picture. A player calls for a betrayal, and asks for a suit. Even if the characters cannot die directly from the challenges, there is a price for failure and betrayal. Sooner or later the cold arms of the grave will welcome all pirates of the sea. There should be 12 empty slots in each character sheet. These slots are used to keep score of the character&rsquo;s failures and betrayals. Each time the character fails a challenge, two X&rsquo;s are added to the counter.&#10;Each time the character betrays the others, one X is added to the counter.&#10;&#10;And each time the character gets one or more X&rsquo;s - a card is drawn. If the value of the card is equal or less than the number of X&rsquo;s on the character sheet, the character&rsquo;s days are numbered and he is doomed.If a character already has 12 X&rsquo;s on the sheet, he is immediately doomed, when he gets the 13th mark.&#10;A doomed character will die in any of the next three scenes. Players should not feel too attached to a doomed character. He might look pale or even ghostly or see omens of his death for he knows that the day is his last.&#10;&#10;When and how does the game end?&#10;The game should end if&#10;&bull; Adventure has reached its conclusion,&#10;&bull; You reach agreed time limit (Professional pirates recommend using 2 hour time limit)&#10;&bull; Players are too tired (of drinking Rum) to play on.&#10;&#10;"

If that happens, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;&#10;    OccupyBoardwalk is an Uncooperative Game for 3 or More Players. It just requires a copy of Monopoly and a book. (It can be any book, but we suggest Das Capital, Road to Serfdom or a pocket copy of the Constitution).  &#10;&#10;&#10;Each round, the public expects the 1% to pay another 1000 dollars of your fortunes towards the public good. To do this, the player with the Top Hat opens the book to a page an puts any amount of money into the book secretly. They then flip to another page and pass the book to the next player. When a player gets the book, they can&rsquo;t flip backwards in the book to see what other players have payed. Once each player has had an opportunity to put money into the book, the first player turns the book over and shakes it over the board. Collect the money that falls out, count it and put it under public parking.&#10;&#10;Remember two things: The player with the most money left at the end of the game wins. Also, the public expects the 1% to pay another $1000 every turn. So the expectations of the public about the amount of money in public parking increases every turn. There are a few other twists and turns involving the removal of protestors from properties, and the use of Chance and Community Chest cards to get bailed out when things get rough.

Take turns rolling the dice to see which spot in the damn is weakened.  If a hamster is on top of that number, that hamster is used to plug to the hole and is placed to the side in a reserve pile to come back into play in the next round.  If a hamster is not on that number, a flood token is placed there until the end of the round, at which time it can be removed by taking a hamster card permanently out of play.  If a flood token is already located on a number that is rolled, another flood token is placed in a special pile of tokens belonging to that player which cannot be removed.  As flood tokens pile up, your stock of hamster saviors dwindles, and flood tokens pile up all the faster.  The game ends when any player accumulates 10 flood tokens (counting both those in the permanent pile and those currently on the dam).  The winner is the player with the fewest flood tokens.  In the case of a tie, the player with the most remaining hamster cards wins.&#10;&#10;"

Mankind has self-actualized enough to realize that we are creatures of violence. Centuries of denying one of our base instincts has not led to a more civilized society. Technological advances have given unprecedented scales of damage potential to our conflicts. In 2153, the Council of Restraint was formed in response to the particularly devastating aftermath of a conflict between the United African Republic and Pacific Rim Conglomerate. Three years later the Conflict Resolution Accords were ratified. Now when conflicts arise, the involved states or ideological groups can settle the dispute in a manner that mitigates widespread destruction. Large, mechanized military machines meet to do battle of epic proportion. These battles are waged in controlled arenas to contain the violence and damage. Armored Terran Systems Corporation manufactures base machines called Mechs and combatants configure their Mech with armaments and options in preparation for combat.&#10;&#10;The Earth Shook is a game where each player assumes the role of a large mechanized military class robot. Where man once waged war across the globe on epic proportions, machines now resolve the conflict in controlled arenas. Build your machine, defend your ideology, and destroy the others. Be the last machine standing on the field of battle; to the victor go the spoils of war.&#10;&#10;Players each receive a basic identical Mech from the factory. They have a set amount of points that they can use to buy modules for the Mech. These modules adjust the ratings for Evasion, Shields, Armor, Speed, Maneuverability, Weapon Damage, Rate of Fire, and more. Once the modules have been purchased, the Mech stats are adjusted to reflect the module choices and teh game can commence.&#10;&#10;Game play is similar to RoboRally or Wings of War in that each player will select 6 Move/Maneuver actions for their Mech each turn. In this manner, a turn is played out in six rounds as the Mechs execute their programmed moves. Can you out-maneuver your opponent? Do you risk an all out frontal attack. Each player will approach the battle differently, hoping to draw upon the strengths of their configured Mech.&#10;&#10;Build &amp; Battle. The game is on...&#10;&#10;"

Once a player completes three orders, she can &quot;harvest&quot; the card for one coin. Each additional completed order is worth a coin, up to a maximum of four. When a player harvests the order card, she draws a new card and uses that to record completed orders (possibly on the same turn) on the order card she already had.&#10;&#10;In the Bohnanza card game, players trade cards to improve the standing of both parties involved in the trade.

After each roll by the active player, all other players can use the dice just rolled &ndash; and not dice already set aside &ndash; to complete orders on their own cards. Thus, the active player has some incentive not to dawdle too much with her rolls as her opponents might benefit from her turn more than she does.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one or more players have collected thirteen Bohnentalers.
