The goal is to get cards of the different types (Luck, Inheritance, and Corporate Know-How) for each of the eight phases of Hughes' life (as defined by the game) in turn. The phases are entered via &quot;doors&quot; on the board and the cards are turned in for money, which is tracked on a small board for each player. In true Hughes style, players may purchase injunctions to prevent movement through certain areas of the board. The object is to amass $2.5 billion dollars, the publisher's estimate of Hughes' fortune at the time.&#10;&#10;In addition to the rules, the &quot;Study Guide&quot; booklet contains 21 pages of material on the life and investments of Howard Hughes and an extensive bibliography.&#10;&#10;Although the name &quot;Urban Systems&quot; does not appear on the game, this is presumably the game in the case Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v.

This case resulted in a judgement for Hughes against the game publisher, requiring them to withdraw the game from sale.&#10;&#10;"

At first, on a turn, your family gets to take only two actions, one for you and one for your spouse, as might be found among all the possibilities on a farm: plowing fields; collecting materials; building fences, and so on. There are numerous choices available, and while the game progresses you'll have more and more, as each round a new action card is flipped over, offering one more possible action. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished but first you'll need to expand your house to make room - and what are you going to feed all the little rug rats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the distribution of cards which represent Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release) these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist. Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it's important to be careful about your choices.  There are countless strategies, some of which depend on your hand of cards.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most Victory Points from the Improvements made on his farm.&#10;&#10;-description originally from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;"

The game can be played with anywhere from 2 to 8 pawns per player. If you wish to play a shorter game you may choose fewer pawns to start with. If you wish to play a longer game you can start with more pawns. Players take turns rolling and moving their pawns around the board. The game includes a Bumpback die that can be rolled when you land on a space that is occupied by another player. The Bumpback die sends pawns back to their start position. Each space has six dots on it and the number rolled on the Bumpback die applies to any pawn resting on that numbered dot. The game can get very exciting with 4 players and 32 pawns on the board.&#10;&#10;
