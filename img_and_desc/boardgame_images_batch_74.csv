Cards are played, with titles straight from pro wrestling moves (Figure Four Leg Lock, Atomic Drops) and quips (Did you see that?!).  The cards have different costs and effects, adjusting the wrestler's fatigue markers as the fighters stun, knock down, and try to pin each other.  Some allow the wrestlers to seize the momentum and attack.  When the players have played all the cards they want, they determine the injuries inflicted onto their wrestlers and refill their hand of cards.  When the deck has ran out of cards, the cards that have been played are reshuffled to form a new deck.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player wins the match by having their opponent's wrestler pinned, knocked out, or disqualified.

There are sixteen cards in each of the four traditional suits: Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. The goal is the same as Chess, to take the opponent's King, but gameplay is truly unique.&#10;&#10;Each player plays with the cards of one suit, which evens the playing field substantially over many card games which are based principally on the luck of the draw. Each card in the deck has a numerical attack strength and an attack pattern which will be familiar to Chess players. However, unlike Chess, the eight Pawn cards have different attack strengths. The number one pawn is called the Ace and can be used in special attacks.&#10;&#10;The game combines mainly strategic thinking with an element of luck, and some bluffing. In most turns, one card is taken from each player. Formulating an attack which takes more than one card, or a defence where no cards are lost, is a key strategic element of the game.&#10;&#10;There are four game modes for 2, 3 and 4 players, plus a collaborative Alliance mode where two pairs team up against each other.&#10;&#10;Unlike some other Chess variants which use cards to modify the traditional game of Chess, Check is a stand-alone card game. No board is required to play.&#10;&#10;"
