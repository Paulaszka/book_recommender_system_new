Every player starts with a weak hand of cards which they attempt to improve upon every round as they accumulate money and play matches against their opponents.&#10;&#10;You will look to strengthen your team so to be more successful in matches, but you'll also need to grow your club's finances so you can buy new players. It's a tricky balancing act to achieve and it might be the case that smart decisions only start paying off as the game goes into the late stages.&#10;&#10;There are five kinds of cards in the game:&#10;&#10;- player cards feature players and you'll use them in matches against an opponent &#10;- formation cards give your playing skills a permanent boost. Keep them on display at all times&#10;- stadium cards increase the money you make when you play a home match&#10;- action cards allow you to weaken an opponent's team or, in some cases, gain extra cards for free&#10;- economy cards give you income you can spend in the Marketplace&#10;&#10;You'll only ever have five cards (six/seven if you happen to have a formation/stadium card in play) in play at one time. Your active hand is known as your Line-Up.&#10;&#10;To play matches, pick an opponent. Add up your total attacking scores across your Line-Up. Your opponent does the same but adds up their total defence score. Then both managers add a dice roll to your score. Highest combined score wins the match!&#10;&#10;The winning team takes three points and moves up the league table. The first team to reach 70 points wins the title!&#10;&#10;Race For The Title is the second game by Webstar Games - the first, Counter Attack, is also football themed.&#10;&#10;Note: Race For the Title didn't meet its Kickstarter goal in 2022.

In the game, you take on the role of an independent Puerto Rican farmer in this new era and compete against others to hire workers to grow, sell, and trade valuable crops. You will also be in charge of resurrecting parts of the country as you attempt to build vital city infrastructure. Your goal throughout the game is to acquire more wealth and prestige than your opponents and become the most prosperous farmer across the country. Each player has their own small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico 1897 uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops that they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not function unless they are staffed by workers.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action associated with that role. The player who selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so; for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, and the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for occupied &quot;large buildings&quot;. Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players, and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico 1897 includes four expansions.&#10;&#10;"

(Other friendly stones can be pushed off by the move, if desired.) The moving player becomes the leader if, after the push, he now has more pairs of stones than the opponent.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players elect to pass, or when the player who doesn't have the leader's token has no way to form a new pair in the future.

Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are 1 - 3 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides a mule. On a turn, three color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. But if all three dice show the same color, this mule runs three spaces ahead. Simple enough so far.&#10;&#10;The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one or two of the dice and only roll the remaining ones. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that color intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.&#10;&#10;"

You'll connect letter, then come up with a word where they show up in that order. The longer the chain of letters, the harder it gets!&#10;&#10;In Worder you will draw letters one at a time and try to extend your existing card grid horizontally and vertically for maximum points. The catch is that with each letter added, you need to be able to form a new word using those letters.&#10;&#10;"

It is famous for hand-made floor tiles made by artisans of the village. Using a limited colour palette and  geometric motifs,  these tiles create intricate patterns with symmetry and repetitiveness and are coveted by architects and home-owners alike.&#10;&#10;In this game, you play the role of a master artisan who has to lay the floor of a Chettinad Mansion using Athangudi tiles. You compete with other players to lay the most impressive floor &amp; to score the highest to win.&#10;&#10;All players progressively lay their own floor of 16 tiles in a 4x4 grid in front of them. The floor is built over four rounds. Each round involves each player picking four tiles from a central supply, keeping one they want &amp; passing the remainder clockwise around the table. By drafting one tile from a progressively depleting pile that's passed by each player around the table, you collect four tiles each round. You can temporarily store these tiles while you wait for a better one, or place them on your floor to score points. Tiles placed in the floor are &quot;set in cement&quot; &amp; cannot be changed for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;You can score points by completing motifs, sequences or goals. Scoring is done at the end of each round, so completing motifs, sequences or goals earlier in the game can help you score higher. At the end of the game, you also score for neatness of the floor, so make sure you're tidy while playing!&#10;&#10;The final score is the sum of the scores of the four rounds, plus the end game scoring. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
