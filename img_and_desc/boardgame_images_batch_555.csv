His challenger, Mitt Romney, survived an at-times brutal primary season to emerge the victor. Can you run a campaign to lead your candidate to victory?&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a set number of cards: several common cards that represent issues (such as Economic Growth or Immigration), demographics (such as Hispanics or Single Women) or regions (such as the Midwest or the Northeast). Each candidate also has many candidate specific cards with special abilities. Each player secretly forms an &quot;Agenda&quot; with these cards. Each player then also places Campaign Tokens--representing the efforts and money they put into campaigning--on each of these Agenda cards (or on random events that want to &quot;spin&quot; their way&quot;). These Agendas and tokens are revealed simultaneously and resolved.&#10;&#10;Players earn support in each &quot;Swing State&quot; (the game starts with 16 swing states, although more can be added as the game progresses) by &quot;winning&quot; these issues, demographics, or special abilities. Players battle these states until election day, when the electoral votes are awarded and a victor is determined. Other campaign tactics--such as selecting a Vice President, gaining grassroots support, and using advertising to change a region's major concern about issues--also come into play.&#10;&#10;This is a print and play game. Print and play instructions are included in the files section.&#10;&#10;"

Using a normal deck of playing cards (and a 12-sided dice if you prefer to roll dice instead of flip cards), with a few simple charts that also follow the same mechanic, you can play out a myriad of matches where wrestler's do all the moves you see on TV.&#10; With MDG, you can play solo - booking matches, running segments and interviews, &amp; playing out the matches with run-ins from other wrestlers (or not) - all of which go into making a wrestling show.  The only difference? You won't know how this script is going to play out. Those matches and segments will affect the company you are trying to run, growing it into a global phenomen or watching it crumble before your eyes.&#10; Of course, you can also play in a group adding one, very important element - each person takes the role (or several roles) of a wrestler. Narrate a segment or cut a promo on your opponent and it will impact the mechanics of the game and your wrestler&rsquo;s options in the ring. And once the bell rings, not only does the mechanics allow you to choose what moves your wrestler does, but it gives you a beginning set of tactics drawn from the real-life wrestling world, tactics to attempt (each with their own advantages and disadvantages). As for those not directly involved in the match, they'll be the crowd and impact the match in a very real way.&#10; This FULL RULEBOOK adds several different match-types (cage, extreme, tag, triangle, battle royal). In addition, the advanced rules continue adding depth by introducing aspects to the game mechanic that turn up the realism such as: Counter ability, Weight &amp; Height, Manager's impact, Intimidation,  Stamina (fatigue, injury, tag team fatigue, wearing an opponent down, wrestling with injuries), blood, referees that impact the match, wrestler's individual advantages &amp; disadvantages, how to make a wrestler and let him grow into an Icon of the wrestling world as well as a world for that wrestler to exist - including 21 original, fully illustrated wrestlers existing within a backdrop as wide-open as your imagination.  This world is constantly growing with at least 4 expansions already planned within the game's 1st year.&#10;&#10;"

Teseo departed to end this foul doing. In Creta met Arianna, Minosse' daughter, that fell in love with him and reveled him the greatest labyrinth secret: the strength of the Minotaur came from 4 magic Talismans created by Minosse, infusing the creature's soul in them. The only way to kill the Minotaur was to divide the Talisman. Teseo did it, after avoiding the maze traps, than fought the man-bull, killing it after a fierce battle. &#10;Hundreds of years later, a greedy hand was going to get the last of the four mighty artifacts, not caring about the warning Teseo carved on the maze wall &ldquo;Never gather what has been divided&rdquo;. A tremor shook the walls and with a loud roar the central labyrinth section collapsed, filling the air with a cloud of hundreds years old dust. A scary and inhuman scream echoed through the stone corridors and while the dust fell down, a huge shape with pointed horns and a large, sharp axe in hand slowly appeared.&#10;&#10;Minosse is a labyrinth game in which four player compete to collect talismans and to get out before the Minotaur catches them.&#10;&#10;The board is created by randomly placing tiles in a 8&times;8 square, with the four goal squares in the center, and with adventurers' starting tiles in the four corners.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into 3 phases:&#10;&#10;     In the first phases the adventurers run toward the center of the labyrinth to get the first talisman. First one to arrive chooses first. To do this, each player gets 3 action points that can be used to rotate tiles, creating a free path to the center, to move from one tile to the next one (as long as you have a connected hallway. Note: these AP (action points) can rotate any tile, so you can use them to slow opponents, disrupting their path. With he first talisman, you also earn a God favor. Talisman power recharges with time, after you use it; God favor is a one shoot power to help you win.&#10;     The second phase starts after everyone gets one talisman. Adventurers must collect the other 3 talismans to complete the ancient artifact. The rules are the same as the first phase, 3 AP for rotating tiles, moving, and activating Talismans where needed.&#10;     When the first adventurer collects the fourth talisman phase 3 begins. The labyrinth center crumbles, and the exit appears. The exit is guarded by the Minotaur, who'll try to catch everyone that got all the four talismans. After each adventurer's turn, the Minotaur moves. Each player secretly lays down a card with a direction and they reveal them all together. The Minotaur moves according to cards. If the Minotaur hits an adventurer with 4 talismans, he badly slows him down. The winner is first adventurer to reach the exit carrying four talismans.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

When you have 5 of one kind in front of you (5 zebras or 5 antelopes), you win the game.&#10;&#10;After you play your herd animal, you may play one action card from your hand. Lions, elephants and giraffes are your action cards.&#10;&#10;To play a lion, place it face up in front of you. When you have played a second lion, you now have Matching Lions. Your matching lions can be used to chase away two animals from one other player&rsquo;s herds. They can chase away 2 zebras, 2 antelopes, or 1 zebra and 1 antelope. The animals all go into the discard pile. You may use your matching lions on the turn you play the 2nd lion, or you may wait and use them on another turn, after playing your action card for your turn. If you gather several pairs of matching lions in front of you, you may use them all on one turn to chase away other players&rsquo; herd animals if you choose.&#10;&#10;When you play an elephant, everyone, including you, must pick up their lions and put them back in their hand. The elephant then goes to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;When you play a giraffe, you may choose any other player and view all the cards in their hand. The giraffe then goes to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Other animals:&#10;&#10;The hippopotamus is a defense card. Play the hippopotamus to block a pair of lions from chasing away any of your herd animals. The hippopotamus and the pair of lions all go to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;The hyena is automatically played when it is drawn. All herd animals migrate left, meaning your herds go to the player to your left, that person&rsquo;s herds go to the player to their left, and so on until every herd has migrated. The hyena goes to the discard pile, and you get to draw again and start your turn. (If you choose, you may use the hyena as an action card instead.)&#10;&#10;When the last card from the deck is drawn, the discard pile is shuffled and replaced as the deck.&#10;&#10;"

Its square, wood pieces are either red or black (with their designations painted on in gold paint) and placed on red squares only.  Players' halves of the board are separated by a &quot;chinese wall&quot; that marks the boundary of their home court vs. their enemy court.  Each player has the following pieces: 1 Emperor, 1 Empress, 3 Princes, 5 Guards, and 5 Archers.  To begin a game, the pieces are arranged as follows: the red square in the player's lower left corner has a pagoda and gets the Empress, the red square in the lower right corner has a crown and gets the Emperor, between them (in the row nearest the player) are the 3 Princes, on the next row's red squares are placed the 5 Guards, and on the third row's red squares are placed the 5 Archers.&#10;&#10;Players then roll dice every turn to determine how many moves each may make, depending on the difference between the numbers they have rolled.  Moves may be made with any combination of the player's pieces, for example: one piece moving three times in a row, or three pieces each moving once.  The pieces are moved only on red squares, with each type of piece having its own type of moving privilege.  Movements must be from one red square to the next unoccupied red square; if the next square is occupied by an enemy piece but the one after is not, the enemy piece must be jumped and removed from the board, and points are scored depending on the point value for that type of piece.&#10;&#10;Archers may only move towards enemy court until they reach the enemy's home row and are then turned over to become Princes. Guards, while in home court, may only move towards enemy court, but having crossed the Chinese Wall can then move in either direction.  When a Guard reaches the enemy's home row it becomes a Prince.  Emperor, Empress, and Princes may move in either direction from the start.&#10;&#10;The winning player removes both his enemy's Emperor and Empress by jumping.  Point totals have accrued throughout the game, and the instructions are not clear as to what this has to do with the ending outcome, though the text on the cover of the game box indicates these scoring rules may be optional.

Hindenburg replaces him, and bold plans are formed. The Germans take desperate gambles as they counterattack against two separate Russian Armies. Russian infighting and ineptitude lead to one of the greatest victories in German military history.&#10;&#10;Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron&#10;The main bodies of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Armies face each other across the fields of southern Poland. Each side moves to attack and drive the other back. The Austro-Hungarian vacillation between different war plans creates confusion, but the fighting spirit of their professional Army produces initial success. Additional Russian armies join the fray and attack the weak Austrian right flank. A see-saw fight ensues, ending with an Austro-Hungarian retreat to the mountain passes protecting their heartland. Both sides now steel themselves for a protracted struggle that could mean the end of either Empire.&#10;&#10;Serbia the Defiant&#10;Austria-Hungary invades Serbia as punishment for her role in the assasination of Archduke Ferdinand at Sarajevo. Since most of the Austrian Army must confront the Russians, the forces facing each other in Serbia are rather evenly matched. The Serbian Army, battle hardened by years of fighting in the Balkans, aggressively counters Austrian incursions. The Serbs fight for their national existence in one of the greatest &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; campaigns of modern history.&#10;&#10;Gorlice-Tarnow Breakthrough&#10;With the front in France stalemated across no-man's land, the Germans redeploy powerful forces to the east. Their objective is to save Austria-Hungary from Russian pressure. Initial penetrations at the towns of Gorlice and Tarnow soon unravel the Russian defenses. A dramatic pursuit of the Russian Army across Poland ensues.&#10;&#10;The 1916 Brusilov Offensive&#10;The brilliant Russian general Brusilov develops tactics to crush the Austro-Hungarian front lines. His bold plans call for wide-front assaults that prevent the concentration of Austrian reserves against any single thrust. The Russians destroy an entire Austro-Hungarian army and create a crisis that the Austrians and their German allies will have extreme difficulty containing. The Russians have the opportunity to win the war on the Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;Romania: Transylvanian Gambit&#10;Russian successes bring the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the breaking point. The Romanians seize the moment to grab Transylvania from their once powerful northern neighbor. The Austrians have little left to hold off the Romanian invasion. An ad-hoc formation of Germans and Bulgarians counter-invade Romania from the south. Russia sends reinforcements to their new ally. Each side moves to seize and retain the initiative in an epic campaign.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;&#10;    1680 Backprinted Counters (6 countersheets)&#10;    Four 34in x 22in Maps (4-5, 5-5, 6-5, 6-6)&#10;    Two 17in x11in Maps (4-5N, 4-5E (or 5-5S?))&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale is 20km / hex&#10;4 days per turn&#10;Unit Sizes: Division / Brigade&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website and user's description)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Eastern Front: 1914-1917 FAQ"

The player who defeats the most foes will be crowned the victor. Each time a player is defeated they may call upon evermore powerful characters to stay in the game. Sometimes which character you choose doesn't matter as much as when you pick them.&#10;&#10;Some characters rely on speed and evasion, others have handy combat tricks and life saving healing abilities to keep them in the fight. While some fight up close and in the thick of the fight, another may stay at the edge of battle sending ranged attacks into the fray.&#10;&#10;Each character has unique abilities and statistics with their own unique combat style. Players roll custom dice corresponding to 4 abilities as well as calling on special abilities unique to each character.&#10;&#10;"

Each player also has a set of four short blocks called &quot;biddis&quot;, with each biddi being one of four colors.&#10;&#10;In the first round, one player rolls four ten-sided dice the same colors as the biddis, rerolling as necessary until at least three different numbers show. Players then race to create a single stack of blocks that includes a biddi at the height shown on the matching colored die. If the red die shows a 3, for example, then the red biddi needs to be placed on third level. What's more, you must create a continuous black line up the face of these blocks, rotating and flipping the blocks as needed to keep the line continuous.&#10;&#10;When someone has created a stack six blocks high, they end the round. Then everyone scores 1 point for each block in their stack, starting from the table up to the highest legally placed block. The player who ended the round scores 2 bonus points for each biddi that shows the smiling face on it right-side-up in their stack.&#10;&#10;Players then complete six more rounds, stacking their blocks one higher level each round so that in the seventh round, they're placing all eight blocks and all four biddis in a stack twelve levels high. After scoring in this seventh round, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

The player who picks the best strategy to take over the board and has superior dart throwing skills wins the game. Also included in the gameplay are playing cards and moving armies and tower. The towers are huge pushpins that physically block darts.&#10;&#10;
