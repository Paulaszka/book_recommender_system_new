The nouns are reserved in a stock for players to select one when they want/need to. A players hand goes down by one, except when they play a noun.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one to get rid of all their words first. The strategy is therefore to block other players and force them to select nouns because they cannot play any other valid words.&#10;&#10;Along the way a lot of fun is had by placing unexpected nouns in the sentences.
