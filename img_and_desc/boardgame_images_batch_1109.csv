This is the first entry in a three part simulation of the failed Soviet offensive to eliminate the salient of the German Ninth Army during the winter of 1942-43 known as Operation Mars (25 Nov - 12 Dec 1942). Players will conduct operations as either Soviet Direction Commander Zhukov or the German commander of the Ninth Army, Model. Several possibilities existed given the terrain and the weather situation and some of these will be possible to explore with this game. Included are some hypothetical options that could have altered the outcome. This work is primarily based on Zhukov's Greatest Defeat by David Glantz with some OOB fleshing by Nafziger and maps based on post-war USGS surveys (which were themselves taken from wartime Soviet surveys).&#10;&#10;Each volume has one 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet (using 20mm hexes to be less cramped) with all three volumes able to link together covering 43&quot; x 48&quot; total area at 1.5 miles/hex and one day per turn.&#10;Each game uses 0.6&quot; counters of mainly German battalions and Soviet regiments or brigades - the first volume (Belyy) has 352 counters with two double-sided and three single-sided PAC accompanying a 18 page rule book, the second volume (Olenino) has 440 counters with three double-sided and two single-sided PAC accompanying a 20 page rule book, and the final volume (Konev) will have 528 counters with three double-sided and three single-sided PAC accompanying a 20 page rule book.&#10;&#10;Included scenario:&#10;Belyy - Volume I - #1 Belyy Thrust - The included scenario provides the players a look at the attacks of Soviet 41st Army which managed the best gains of the operation. The goal of this scenario is to present players with a fluid breakthrough and timely reinforcements. Both sides hoping their command decisions will carry the day. Scenario Duration: Turns 1-10 (25 Nov - 4 Dec) on Map KS.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Cards are split down the middle with some combination of interior decorations (houseplants, paintings and lamps) on each half, and they must be played so that they overlap at least one half of an already played card.&#10;&#10;To end their turn, they refill their hand, then reveal an event card, which may be a judge, a reshuffle, or crickets.

There has never been a more wacky, back and forth trading situation than with crypto, especially now.&#10;&#10;Hodl It is played in a group of 3-8 players, where there are up to 8 different coin cards in play for everyone to collect within a round. These coin cards come in sets, and in order to win the game, a player must endeavour to collect all of one set. They can however, also utilise wildcards mixed into the deck which can have a positive, or a negative effect.&#10;&#10;As the round progresses, players are trading 1, 2, 3 or more cards at a time. These trades are likely made up of coin cards but can include wildcards that the player doesn't want in their hand by the end. In turn, they are aiming to collect the cards they need from other players from that trade, so effectively it is fastest person first providing they aren't blindly competing for the same coin card. The round ends as soon as one player has a full winning set in hand and claims 'HOLD IT'!&#10;&#10;The round can be played in as little as 5 minutes, depending on how volatile you make your trades, providing they follow some simple rules such as all the cards being traded, are of the same suit. As the rounds can be so short, this is a game of score and how well you can build that score up over several rounds, with each potential win in a round being of a varied score in itself.&#10;&#10;The game is solely played with cards within one card deck. There are no other components.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
