Both countries have one army and one civilian power deck. Each deck contains intelligence and attack cards, and a Joker card. Each side has a power deck as well as an event card drawn at the beginning of each round, independently of the sides. In the game, which is based on turn-based gameplay, after a series of successive preparation phases, the skirmish phase comes. In the preparation phase, the sides manage their hands; draw a card, change or lay -there is also the mechanic of advancing the convoy of the Russian side-. When it comes to the skirmish round, the dice are rolled by calculating the combos and advantages of the drawn cards: depending on the result, either the Russian convoy was stopped or damaged, or the Ukrainian side's attempts were unsuccessful.&#10;&#10;If the convoy reaches Kyiv by capturing the cities on its way, one after the other, until the end of the grand tour, and thereby capturing the capital, it will be successful. On the other hand, if the Ukrainian side neutralizes the invasion attempt by slowing down the convoy or destroying all of them one by one, they win.&#10;&#10;Prepare your strategy, follow your opponent closely and wish you luck. Be brave or cautious; The fate of the war is in your hands.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Two players take control of historical armies to see how well they might fare as compared to their historical counterparts. In what will hopefully be the first in a series of volumes covering this evolution, four battles are included: Marathon (490 BCE), Thermopylae (480 BCE), Plataea (479 BCE), and Mycale (479 BCE). Each battle takes two to three hours to complete.&#10;&#10;The game system is a departure from other ancient combat games in several key ways:&#10;&#10;The game uses a square grid, rather than hexes, to regulate movement. This provides eight vectors of advance (rather than six) and allows for more realistic linear movement and combat.&#10;&#10;The game uses a unique card-based activation system that provides armies with better leadership to be more flexible with regards to their actions on the battlefield. Unlike traditional &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; activations, formations may activate multiple times during their turn to provide more historically accurate outcomes.&#10;&#10;The game simulates hoplite formations in a manner allowing players to allocate where their forces' strength lays, unknown to their oppoenent until combat units actually engage. This allows a player to decide where to allocate their strengths, rather than relaying upon the values printed on a combat unit. Additionally, these denser units take damage differently, allowing them to be ground down while pressing forward in a manner that does not require record keeping.&#10;&#10;Finally, the deck of cards allows for special effects that can help a side turn the tide of a battle in their favor or stave off disaster at the last moment.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

There are 60 different meat cards in the game, with a picture and name on the front and some facts on the meat on the back (e.g. how many carbs it contains). At the start of the game every player receives 3 cards. You may only see the front of the cards, the facts side will be facing your opponents. Divide the remaining meat cards in half to make two face up decks. There are 12 theme cards in the game with assignments on what what requirements the meat must meet. Shuffle the theme cards and place 3 face up for everyone to see. The start player picks one of these cards to be active that round. Starting with the start player and going clockwise everyone plays one of their meat cards (picture side up). Choosing the card they think best matches the requirements of the theme card this round. Since everyone sees the facts on other players cards, but not their own, players may negotiate or advice each other on which card to choose. Lying is allowed. When everyone has put down their card, turn over all played cards and check whose card matches the theme best. That player wins the theme card and a new theme card is put in its place. Played meat cards are discarded. The game resumes with the next player clockwise being the new start player. All players pick a new meat card from one of the two open decks, beginning with the new start player. The first player who collects 3 theme cards is the winner and receives the title of Meat Master.&#10;&#10;The more you play the game the more you'll learn on meat. The data on the meat cards is based on the Standard Tables of Food Composition published by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.&#10;&#10;"

This extremely accurate and rigorously-researched game opens as the Western Interior Seaway shrinks, and with it the fortunes of once-mighty dino shipping magnates. But this paves the way for expansion by dino rail barons, eager to bring goods made at dino factories to emerging dino cities! But even these tyrannosaurus tycoons might find their legends eclipsed by dino airlines.&#10;&#10;Hexagonal tiles are placed on water hexes to shrink the Seaway, and also serve as the timer of the game. Each player gets an equal number of turns in which they place a tile, buy one share of stock, and then take one action &ndash; building for a railroad, making a delivery, producing goods, establishing an airport, or recycling. Each industry works and scores a little differently, and with only a handful of turns, you'll need to invest and act carefully, with an eye toward incentivizing your fellow players to do the hard part for you. End the game with the most money, and you win!&#10;&#10;The first game design by Hollandspiele founder Mary Holland, collaborating with veteran cube rails designer Amabel Holland (Irish Gauge), Dinosaur Gauge is a gleeful game about managing chaos, emergent alliances, and, most of all, how much Mary loves dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

But with tanks and missiles in both hands.&#10;The focus of the fighting was in Central Europe, the economic and cultural center. Two hundred thousand Red Army soldiers, who were supposed to be reduced in number, crossed the East-West German border one after another, supplementing and defeating NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) forces that were moving in surprise attacks at various points. Hamburg and Haber fell on the second day of the faith, and Bremen on the third day. On the North German Plain, the traditional West German armored divisions also faced the oncoming Red Storm, but they had a hard time.&#10;The fighting within West Germany was coming to an end. A Red Army tank division surrounded the Ruhr industrial area.

All the while players will hinder each other by planting weeds, creating a flood or unleashing aphids or hail on their opponents.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Industry is dynamic with finance, and local municipalities grow depending on the economic activity in their immediate area. Players also compete against the plutocracy, a NPC.&#10;&#10;COMPANIES&#10;Like many train games companies are separate entities than the players. Company management changes depending on share ownership. Other companies, the government, and the plutocracy can also own companies. Companies get started with an IPO, after that share price is dependent on both industrial activity and share trades. Company management can involve managing railways, ships, wagons, and hiring professionals to provide the company advantages.&#10;&#10;GOVERNMENT&#10;The government is controlled by the player with the most votes. Votes come from not only other players, but from the public and the plutocracy as well. Certain actions impact the public's and plutocracy's opinion of the players which can change their vote. In addition to creating government run companies or investing public funds into private companies, the governor is able to change corporate and income taxes, outlaw or legalize labour unions, provide welfare payments with government funds, and hire and manage lawmen.&#10;&#10;THE MOB AND THE UNION&#10;These are 2 other entities that players can use to manipulate the situation on the map. Union stewards can harass company activity and attempt to gain higher wages for the public. The mob might also harrass companies, but can also come after union stewards. Lawmen can always attempt to stop gangsters, but can't interfere with union stewards unless unions are outlawed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

You could also call it a tactical level wargame, but without the nasty subject.&#10;&#10;In this game two squirrel families try to collect and bury as many nuts as possible, before winter sets in. In the process they have to use the terrain to their advantage, block the opponent from reaching nuts, steal each other's nuts and also throw a nut or two at each other every once in a while. It's mad family-friendly fun, even for the most seasoned Grognard.&#10;&#10;Each squirrel has a certain amount of hexes it can move and an amount of nuts it can carry. Then there are special abilities, like burying nuts for points. This way there is no dice rolling apart from figuring out random events and the exact result of throwing nuts at each other (the targeted squirrel might lose the nuts on its hex!).&#10;&#10;Squirrel Tactics is available for download on Wargame Vault.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Gain an additional action by putting more muscle on the streets, but be careful!

Play as one of four unique factions and assemble your crew of defenders from a wide range of animal characters to resist the machines across a modular map that changes with each game.&#10;&#10;War has come to the Wild. For millennia, animals have weathered shifting alliances and the cycle of hundred-year seasons&mdash;but they&rsquo;ve never faced an enemy like this. An army of machines powered by corrupted magic is rampaging across the Commonwood, enclosing everything in its path and exploiting the warmth of the world. Across the marshes, plains, mountains, and forests, scrappy crews of defenders rise up to resist the machine occupation. The partisans hail from four factions, each determined to fight back in their own way: the Council with its fortitude and bread, the Order with its wisdom of the flame, the Sect with its ingenious inventions, and the Coven with its spells and subterfuge.&#10;&#10;Players are organizers of the animal resistance who have converged on a dangerous flashpoint in the war against the machines. Construction has begun on a new machine core and sprawling factory complex where an animal village once stood. Engines are building walls that enclose habitat after habitat while mechs guard expanding factories and toxic pollution spreads. Organizers must cooperate with each other despite longstanding factional disagreements and help their network of fellow defenders take actions in the right locations and at the right times in order to win this crucial battle. Clear pollution, fight mechs, breach walls, build camps, and rewild factories before the machines complete construction of the core and conquer this region of the Commonwood.&#10;&#10;Can the Defenders band together to heal the land and outsmart a seemingly impossible enemy? Or will the Commonwood succumb to an endless industrial winter? It&rsquo;s up to you and your comrades to decide.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
