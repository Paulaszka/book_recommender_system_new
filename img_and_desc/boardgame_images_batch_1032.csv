On this &quot;dice walk&quot; through the city, you can visit thirteen historical places, many of which are still in the same place today, while others have changed structure significantly and some have moved locations or disappeared.&#10;&#10;In Hagen 1888, you want to visit a variety of locations, but ideally you can reach the right locations at the right time to score more points than others. On a turn, you roll the six-sided die, then either bank those movement points or roll again; if you roll again and get a result higher than your first roll, you bank the sum of the two rolls; if your second roll is equal to or lesser than the first roll, you bank no movement points this turn.&#10;&#10;Next, you can move your figure on the game board, which depicts a network of walkways. Most spaces on the walkways are gray, but the board has twelve lettered building spaces in six colors as well as the Rathaus (town hall) in a seventh color. If you start on a building, you must move; otherwise movement is optional. One point of movement takes you to an adjacent space on a walkway.&#10;&#10;If you end your movement on a lettered building (which must differ from where you started), you can place one of your eight tokens in the lowest open space on the &quot;Hagen points&quot; board for that letter.&#10;&#10;If you end your movement at the Rathaus, you remove your figure from the game board and place it on a 4-point space in the Rathaus section of the &quot;Hagen points&quot; board. On each subsequent turn, you no longer move your figure, but instead you may spend 6 movement points to raise a previously placed token in a letter column to the first open space higher in that column; alternatively you can spend 12 points to move it up two spaces. Once you are in the Rathaus, to end your turn, place one of your eight tokens on a 1-point space in the Rathaus.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you must have fewer than 8 movement points banked. Once a player has placed all eight of their tokens on the Hagen points board, the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players score the points listed next to their placed tokens, in addition to 1 point per 4 banked movement points and 3 points for each color of building in which they have a token, with a maximum color bonus of 21. Whoever has scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

The real challenge isn&rsquo;t just solving the problem with the limited information you and your players have; it&rsquo;s dealing with the frustrations that will inevitably occur when your partner does something that messes up your plan. In order to be successful in D&eacute;corum, there will come a point where both players will have to let go of their initial strategy for how they were going to finish the board and start paying attention to what their partner is doing instead. By introducing and providing an incentive to resolve conflict, D&eacute;corum mechanically encourages (or even requires) a positive form of compromise.&#10;&#10;Each player draws a &quot;Scenario&quot; card that lists a set of criteria of what types of d&eacute;cor a room must have or cannot have.  For example &quot;No room may contain a lamp&quot; or &quot;Every room must contain a wall hanging&quot;.  Players keep their criteria secret.&#10;&#10;The play surface is a board displaying various rooms in a house.  Each room has multiple items that can potentially be placed in the room.  Players take turns placing, moving, or removing colored tokens on the board, where each token represents an item of home d&eacute;cor.  Each token placed may conform with, or violate, the other players' criteria.  After each token is placed, other players may state they like the item of d&eacute;cor, as placed, or they do not like the item of d&eacute;cor, as placed.  Further discussion or explanation is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players' criteria are satisfied.&#10;&#10;"

Your job is to drive tourists across the savannah where they may take photos of animals.&#10;&#10;The Mara consists of face down tiles where only the habitat color is known, not the animal symbol. The players take turns to either pick up/drop off tourist cards at lodges or to drive their jeeps and peek at adjacent tiles. The more tourists they have, the less drive actions can they take.&#10;&#10;If both color and symbol matches a tourist on picked up card, the player takes a photo by placing a gem on the tourist.&#10;&#10;Each tourist has a favourite animal and each animal has its favourite habitat. When all the tourists have been picked up or all the animals have been photographed, the game ends and the player with the most complete sets of animal photos wins.&#10;&#10;The Mara combines child-friendly mechanics like deduction, memory and pick-up and delivery with a healthy dose of randomness to provide a fun experience for the entire family. Animal cards tell you where on the map the animals are likely to be found, memorizing the animals you pass help you find them for the next tourist, and skilful jeep driving let you deliver as many tourists to the animals as possible.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

But the new King&rsquo;s position is weak, as is his Kingdom. Sweden is indebted to the Hansaetic League, Denmark has not given up her claim to the Swedish crown and Europe suffers from religious turmoil.&#10;&#10;But this is also an opportunity to start something new. By developing the economy, reforming the taxation and building a national army, Gustav Vasa sets out to consolidate his dynasty and his Kingdom. Take advantage of natural resources, encourage domestic manufacturing, establish overseas markets and engage in profitable wars to pursue the King's will. This is only the foundation of a strong and powerful nation!&#10;&#10;Take turns to add estate cards to a card tableau. Each placed estate card lets you execute all the actions of the estate cards in that column.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Peasant: Place farms or sell resources to shops.&#10;     Burgher: Place shops or use buy basic resources from shops to turn them into advanced resources.&#10;     Clergy: Place churches to collect tax from farms or supply Royal missions with advanced resources.&#10;     Nobility: Add provinces to the Kingdom or supply Royal missions with advanced resources.&#10;&#10;&#10;Resources enter and exit the city to and from different sides of the city grid. As more advanced resources enter the economy, they can be invested in advanced farms and shops that enable the production of advanced resources within the Kingdom. However, such actions also require a combination of two similar estate cards in the same column so plan your card tableau wisely.&#10;&#10;The players who has supplied the most resources to the Royal Missions wins.&#10;&#10;"

Where science forgets who it was and logic calculates that it cannot do everything. You don&rsquo;t know who trust, but cooperation is going to be essential in order to tie the events down and crystallize a coherence for this spreading caos. And of course you are the only person who knows the truth behind the &quot;SCP - db&quot;, the Standbeelden.&#10;&#10;The SCP Foundation is a fictional international organization that contains and classificates anomalities outside bounds of natural law to prevent mass panic. But, what happens before these events are classified and somehow enprisoned? What if those were free?&#10;&#10;This is a game based on the contemporary era and involves suburb investigation on paranormal events along a fractional surrealism. The players get bits and pieces of what&rsquo;s going on and tie them together, giving different endings to it depending on the interpretations of their character's point of view. The objective is to propose the most coherent scenario in a convincing storyline.&#10;&#10;The game starts by dealing Character and Object cards that remain hidden. Then a keyframe card is revealed, this one contains a mysterious image and narrative fragment. All the players pose their questions around it and then take turns to answer them with a small story in order do build coherence. A vote round will determine which storyline wins, staying as the real version of the occurred events. The corresponding player's character then becomes the protagonist who will then explain what the &quot;SCP - db (Standbeelden)&quot; turns out to be. The losers will give an outcome to their character taking into account what the protagonist, the antagonist, the narration, the secondary characters and the items are.&#10;&#10;It is better consider this game not as a zero sum game but as a narrative game-tool. An open ended game in which players can also write their own keyframes and subsequently play as many keyframes as they want. Any doubt about the game is to be determined by the people involved.&#10;&#10;This game's setting underlines the human ability to cooperate and piece together non-linear narratives in search of further, more rhythmic patterns. Through overinterpretation, eldritchness and speculation. It puts into consideration the next questions: &ldquo;What is that which we do not acknowledge as a whole?&rdquo; And &ldquo;Why does it necessarily and so often have to do with streams of massive delusion?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
