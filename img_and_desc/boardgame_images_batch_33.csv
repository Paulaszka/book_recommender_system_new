The player assumes the role of a fire boss and must decide the most effective way of fighting a forest fire - both in terms of tactics used and value lost. Fire growth is governed by the game system with wind and fuel moisture content as the driving forces. The goal of the player is to contain the fire while keeping costs low and still be able to get home in time for supper.&#10;&#10;
3809,,"In Show Jumping, up to 4 players attempt to run their horse through a series of jumps, in the least amount of moves. Dice rolls are used to determine movement, but each player can maneuver their horse to the best possible point to attempt a jump. Jump cards can also be obtained and held, which can help a player go over a particularly hard jump. The jumps on the board can be set up in many different configurations, to make many different courses. The game can also be played solitaire, with the lone player attempting to complete a course in the fewest possible moves.&#10;&#10;"

Among the requirements are various ingredients, such as body parts or duct tape, as well as completing &quot;Lesser Experiments&quot;, such as building a mind control laser or harnessing a brain in a jar.  These lesser experiments also require ingredients, and once completed they can give players special powers (such as increasing their hand size).  Players may trade with other players for ingredients and whatnot on their way to world domination.&#10;&#10;"

The scenarios show several common situations involving German, British and Italian Units.  The combination of situations with varying forces allow an almost innumerable amount of different scenarios to be played.&#10;&#10;Desert War is basically a two-Player game. It is played in sequenced turns, during which the Players use a new &amp; unique simultaneous plotting and moving system to move their units on the map, have combat and attempt to achieve certain objectives. The game is played in Scenarios which are various mixtures of forces and objectives.&#10;&#10;The Western Desert, stretching 1,400 miles between Tripoli and Alexandria, was described by one German general as &quot;a tactician's paradise and a quartermaster's hell.&quot; Between March 1941, when Rommel's Afrika Korps arrived in Tripoli, and May 1943, when the last Axis troops surrendered in Tunisia, the conduct of the Desert War furnished the proof for that general's impression.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactical simulation designed to recreate the mechanized struggles which took place in the &quot;perfect&quot; tactical terrain of North Africa during World War II. The 22&quot; x 34&quot; two-color mapsheet depicts a composite desert battlefield on which the flat sands are sparsely interrupted by patches of rocky cover or slight differences of elevation. Each mapsheet hex represents a hundred meters of distance and each Game-Turn represents three and a half minutes of actual time. Four hundred die-cut units represent the Allied, German and Italian combat units that contest the differing Desert War situations and scenarios. Opposing infantry companies, supported by tank platoons and anti-tank and artillery batteries engage each other within the tactical game scale of Desen War.&#10;&#10;Desert War is a tactician's simulation tool. Those of you who have been following this series from PanzerBlitz and Combat Command: Tactical Armored Warfare, France 1944 through Red Star/White Star: Tactical Combat in Europe in the 1970's,  know that Desert War is a development of game you won't want to miss.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 3.5 minutes&#10;Hex: 109 yards / 100 meters&#10;Units: Platoon to Company&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; two-color map&#10;One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 10-page folded rulebook&#10;One Simultaneous Movement Plot pad&#10;Two Scenario &amp; Tables players aid sheet&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Low&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;"

However, there are interesting movement rules - no jumping over other followers; landing exactly on another gets another move, or sometimes a chance to steal a gem. There is also a hand management aspect, as to collect a gem, you have to have a card for it. Card swapping is done by getting a follower to the right place. Add cobras (blocking pieces) and snake charmers (to get past cobras) into the mix.&#10;&#10;"

Each player then secretly commits a ship card to it from their hand of five.  The winner of the round is the player whose ship best meets the mission's criteria.&#10;&#10;Ships are rated for Space Combat, Marines, Diplomacy, Science, and Cargo.  Most missions will only use one of these (i.e., &quot;highest Space Combat wins&quot;) while some use two combined (i.e., &quot;highest total of Science and Cargo wins&quot;).  A few missions add special conditions; ships sent to defend against Gorn attack may not be Gorn, for example, while the Romulan Civil War excludes all but Romulans, and negotiations with alien pacifists go to the highest Diplomacy after Space Combat and Marines are subtracted.&#10;&#10;From the rule sheet cover:&#10;&#10;Star Fleet Missions is a card game played with two decks of cards:  Ship Cards and Missions Cards.&#10;&#10;Each Ship Card represents a starship.  there are 18 cards for each of six &quot;races&quot; (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Gorn, Tholian, and Orion Pirate), for a total of 108.  (Race means &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;empire.&quot;)&#10;&#10;Each Ship Card shows the class (type of ship), the name of the specific ship, and five Ratings which are used to determine the suitability of a ship for a given Mission.  These Ratings vary from 1 to 16.&#10;&#10;The other two Ship Cards represent starships with Legendary Captains and are the most powerful Ship Cards in the game.  All five Ratings are 20!&#10;&#10;Each Mission Card describes an exciting mission on which you will send one or more starships.  Each Mission Card describes the Mission, tells how many ships to send on the Mission, provides any special instructions, and describes how to &quot;win&quot; that Mission (i.e., which Ratings of the ships sent will be used to determine which ship performed the best.)&#10;&#10;"

Black wins if 3 non-adjacent sides are connected, white if 2 opposite sides are. Thus black's goal is harder; to compensate, black will begin with some pieces already on the board. Initially, players do not yet have assigned colors; they take turns each placing a black piece on an empty hex. Either player may instead pass to become black (when they feel black has enough pieces on the board); the other player becomes white and places a white piece, and they continue alternating turns placing their own color. Black wins by forming a Y (connecting 3 non-adjacent sides) but loses by connecting 2 opposite sides without a Y. Likewise white wins by connecting 2 opposite sides but loses by forming a Y without connecting 2 opposite sides.&#10;&#10;"

There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;"

Jordan Weisman has tasked his design team with using the click-dials used in Mage Knight/Mage Knight Dungeons/Hero Clix to present a system of combined arms warfare in the BattleTech universe.  The system encourages use of Battlemechs, vehicles, and infantry to conquer your opponent.  The vehicles and infantry have dials similar to Mage Knight figures, with some new symbols to indicate new game mechanics.  Vehicles have long bases, like the mounted units.   Battlemechs use larger dials and include a heat dial which modifies three of the stats as the mech performs more actions.  The final result, while similar to Mage Knight is much more, using the simple action based system and dials, and bringing a new form of wargaming to the table.&#10;&#10;"

3883,,"&quot;4th Reich: Puremen vs. the Mutants for Control of the World&quot; is a somewhat obscure wargame by Task Force Games based on (albeit without attribution) the SF-novel &quot;The Iron Dream&quot; by the Jewish author Norman Spinrad. This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his &quot;Kampf&quot; in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's &quot;Iron Dream&quot;, a pulp-tale about &quot;Ubermenschen&quot; conquering a future world filled with mutant &quot;scum.&quot; The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed in an apparent attempt to avoid infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book.&#10;&#10;"
