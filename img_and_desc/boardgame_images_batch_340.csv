When a player has 2 or fewer cubes left, the game ends.&#10;Players draw a number of cubes from the pool of 50 coloured cubes (5 colours and numbered 0-9. The same number is displayed on all six faces of the die). This varies depending upon the number of players in the game.&#10;In turn, each player tries to place a higher valued pyramid on the board than the previous player.

In this case, they may place a pyramid of any value. &#10;The board has inset spaces to take the cubes at an angle for stacking the number cubes. A player forms a pyramid by having using three dice on the same level to form a base. Add together the numbers on the bases of these three cubes. The cube placed on the apex of this pyramid must match the last digit of the sum of numbers on the bases. (example: the base is formed of the numbers 5,7,9. The sum is 21. The apex of the pyramid must be a 1). &#10;The value of pyramids played is similar to a poker hand and varies from High Value (different colours and values) to a 'Royal Straight Flush' (a 7,8,9,0 with a 7 at the apex of the same colour).&#10;&#10;"

While I was designing GridIron Wars, an idea popped into my head&#10;regarding a similar method to resolve a baseball game. After putting the idea to paper and mailing it to a couple of trusted friends,&#10;HardBall Wars was born. HardBall Wars is simple enough for a child to learn, but robust enough to satisfy even the most veteran of baseball gamer.&#10;&#10;Many may wonder, why a baseball game? Aren&rsquo;t there plenty of good ones already on the market? In short, the answer is yes. There are many&#10;fantastic baseball games on the market. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;m really not re-inventing the wheel. You&rsquo;ll never hear me tout the game as&#10;better or more realistic than any other game currently on the market.&#10;&#10;However, having said that, I do feel like this game stands up well against any other baseball game in terms of what is truly most important,&#10;the &ldquo;fun factor&rdquo;. My testers and I have had an absolute blast playing the game. The unique batter-pitcher interface, combined with the X-&#10;Factor deck, makes the game unique and in my humble opinion very fun to play.&#10;&#10;My philosophy with Downey Games has always been to price games as low as possible, making the games accessible to all. Most current baseball&#10;board games sell in the $50-$60 range. While that is reasonable to most, it does make it an expensive proposition to purchase multiple&#10;seasons or teams. With HardBall Wars, I&rsquo;ve purposely designed the game with a cost factor in mind. For that same $50 or $60 you&rsquo;ll be able&#10;to purchase multiple seasons of HardBall Wars. Also unlike other games, we strive to rate nearly every player who stepped foot on the field&#10;of play.&#10;&#10;HardBall Wars is based upon a modified log5 method. That may not mean much to some, but using this method allows the pitcher and batter to&#10;&quot;Interact&quot; on every at-bat. Rather than a 50/50 model or a generic pitcher grade, with HardBall Wars you'll see the difference between&#10;pitchers and batters and their impact on the at-bat in a very visual way. You'll also immediately see the difference in righty/lefty&#10;matchups at the plate.&#10;&#10;Fielding is not neglected in HardBall Wars. You'll see the difference between the gold glove shortstop and the lead gloved fielder not only&#10;in terms of errors committed but also the ability to turn hits into outs.&#10;&#10;The most unique aspect of HardBall Wars is our introduction of the X-Factor Deck. And often times it can generate a lot of excitement.&#10;&#10;Within the X-Factor deck just about anything you&rsquo;ve ever seen in a baseball game can take place. From run downs, appeals, dropped third&#10;strikes, rain delays, rain outs, ejections, brawls to even the extremely bizarre like the now famous Pine Tar incident&mdash;all are possible&#10;within the X-Factor Deck.&#10;&#10;The deck is far more than just a Rare Play mechanism. There are many conditional events within the deck and even some very mundane plays.&#10;&#10;The X-Factor deck simulates the events that happen in real life that as a tabletop gamer you don&rsquo;t often see in your own gaming. One can see&#10;something out of the ordinary in almost every baseball game in real life. And we have brought that to the tabletop through the use of the X&#10;-Factor Deck.&#10;&#10;With HardBall Wars, the decisions as a manager are all yours. You decide when to steal bases. You decide when to Hit and Run or Sacrifice&#10;the runner to the next base. You'll make the call when to intentionally walk the opposition&rsquo;s slugger, or when to bring the infield in to&#10;cut down a runner at the plate. You'll make the call as when to attempt a squeeze bunt or play for the big inning. You'll make the call to&#10;bring in the lefty specialist to face the opposing left hand slugger, or stick with your right hand throwing starter. With HardBall Wars, you&#10;may even be ejected from the game! Nearly every situation that faces a major league skipper is replicated in the game.&#10;&#10;The printed game features game charts printed in full-color, the season of your choice, 3 dice, a die-cut X-Factor deck also printed in full color, score sheets all packaged in a sturdy game box.&#10;&#10;"

At the start of the game, one player is secretly assigned the role of Opener, but no one - not event the player who is the Opener - knows who the Opener is.  The Opener card, and other attribute cards, are distributed to the players in destiny piles.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, your destiny, and the destiny of the other players, will gradually be revealed. The Opener is destined to break the walls that keep past, present future, the dead, and the living separate. If you discover that you are The Opener, your goal is to complete the opening ritual by killing all of the other players. If you are not The Opener, your goal is to bind him or her and stop the opening ritual.&#10;&#10;If you die and the game is not over, you become a ghost. Ghosts can only win if a Haunting card that gives them a win condition is in play. What are Haunting cards and how do they work? You add Haunting cards to your destiny pile when you are haunted by ghosts or if you fail a destiny search. A Haunting card comes into play when another player probes your destiny pile and finds a Haunting card.&#10;&#10;Haunted Destinies uses a tiled board system similar to Betrayal at the House on the Hill, but each tile edge indicates the minimum number of movement points need to leave through that edge.  Some tiles have an &quot;X&quot;, indicating that you can not leave that way.  This tile setup creates interesting, semi-solid maze-like boards that are different each game.&#10;&#10;Haunted Destinies is a game for three to six players. It uses a custom set of board tiles, three custom card decks, a black six sided die, and a white six sided die. You can download the custom parts and the rules at http://www.invisible-city.com/play/499/haunted-destinies. A four-player game takes about 60 minutes to play. Since it deals with ritual sacrifice and murder, Haunted Destinies is appropriate for ages 16 and up.&#10;&#10;"

The game consists of a plastic tile board and 100 various tiles each with a letter and point assigned to it on each side. The game has five different variations of play. In Game One: The grid begins empty except for the word LOOKEE spelled out in the center. Using at least one letter on the board each player must take turns making their own word (with the 7 tiles they began with) using at least one pre-existing tile.Each turn must be finished within 30 seconds. These words could be spelled forward, backward, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player scores points for all the letters on their new word. After each turn, the player who went replenishes back to seven tiles. The player with the most points after the grid is filled is the winner. Game Two: First player to reach 100 points wins. In this game, the entire tile board is filled with letters at random. The first player tries to locate a word in any direction, and receives the added points for that word. The tiles used are then flipped over creating a new board every turn. The next player goes and so on. Only 30 seconds per turn. Game Three: Same as game two except additional option. Look for letter groupings that can be rearranged to form words. E.G. T,C,R,U,K can be TRUCK. First to 100 points wins. Game Four: Play solitaire by setting up the board as in Game One. Score as many points as possible in a given time period. Game Five: By using another game board, a duplicates version could be played by using identical letters and setting a time limit.&#10;&#10;"

When you have read and played everything this booklet contains, you will be prepared to design a Civil War game which has all the simplicity necessary for a great game.  The first version described is called the TRAINING GAME because it is designed to teach the basic mechanics of recreating Civil War battles with miniatures soldiers.
