12418,,"This is Vanilla Ice's Rap Happy Rhyme to Rhythm Game. Players play rhyming cards to complete rap lines on the game board. Each card played scores points. Every time a rap line is completed, the player raps it out loud to the rhythm of the electronic beat box mike. When all the rap lines on the board have been filled, players count their points. The player with the most points wins, and raps the entire board, using the &quot;beat box&quot; mic. This game is a pretty funny gem from the early 90s.&#10;&#10;"

Strategies will range from aggressive assaults, multi-front advance or defensive maneuvers with the idea of wearing down your opponents --- with some luck thrown in. The 2-sided gameboard is divided into 12 by 12 grids --- with one side used for a standard game and the other for a variation game. The cards provide extra power to your attacking forces, like Air Strikes, Armored, Engineering, Special Forces and more. Two basic units are used in the game: Divisions (powerful but slow) and Brigades (quick but less powerful). An interesting game. 2 to 4 players. Ages 12 and up.

Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of CATAN, while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.&#10;&#10;&#10;Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shattered Empire&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition &#226;&#128;&#147; Shards of the Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented in:&#10;&#10;    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Quad system that were published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #186, Jul/Aug 1997.&#10;&#10;1 turn = 1/2 day, 1 hex = 2 miles.&#10;&#10;Mons, 23-27 August 1914 : &quot;As the right wing of the German Army swept through Belgium in the opening days of the World War, the British landed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the continent. Taking up position on the French left, they prepared for the German onslaught at the town of Mons. German General Alexander von Kuck's First Army was quick in coming. After a day long fight at Mons, the British fell back in a delaying action, eventually making a stand at Le Cateau. But the time they had bought proved critical in the upcoming Battle of the Marne&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Marne, 5-10 September 1914 : &quot;Following their defeat in the &quot;Battle of the Frontiers&quot;, the Allied armies retreated westwards, pursued by the Germans. The French chief commander, Field Marshal Joffre, decided to make a stand south of the Marne River. The German, changing their initial Schlieffen Plan, attacked through the gap between Paris and the Allied left wing, further to the east. Their intent was to destroy the Allied armies in one grand battle of annihilation. But the plan went awry. The Germans had outrun their lines of communication, and it was difficult for them to replace their losses while the Allies, with their ever shortening lines of communication, quickly regained strength. At the critical moment, the French Paris Garrison counterattacked on the extended German right flank. The resulting conflagration caused the German to pull back. The Allied armies were saved and the deadlock on the Western Front would soon begin.&#10;&#10;"

12498,,"This game is themed on The Country Club Plaza, or simply &quot;The Plaza&quot;, an upscale shopping district in Kansas City, Missouri. I'm not certain where to begin describing this one, so let me give an overview and a look at the components.&#10;&#10;The game board is styled after the traditional Monopoly board as a square with properties down each of the sides and special areas on the corners--in this case the corners are *J.C. Nichols Parkway* Start &gt;, Tax Audit &laquo;Pay&raquo;, &deg;Stock Market: Collect&deg;, and *Uninsurable Loss*.  Unlike the traditional Monopoly board, there are no squares that are not properties (e.g. no Chance, Community Chest) Additionally, the properties are not grouped in colors.  All of the properties are representative of Plaza businesses at the time of printing.&#10;&#10;The six player pieces are small, colored, enameled, metal, horse-drawn carriages, like the type that they use for carriage rides down on The Plaza.  Additionally, there is money in denominations of $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000.  There is a spinner with the numbers 1,000 to 12,000.  There is also a deck of action cards with various things like &quot;Option to buy  - spin dial, pay  amount on dial&quot;, &quot;Stock Market Falls - Pay $10,000 to bank, don't move, resume play&quot;, and the enigmatic &quot;Two Spaces&quot;.&#10;&#10;...and that's it; no instructions, no dice, no property deeds or property values.  I'm stumped as to whether this was actually a game, or if this was a game prototype that never made it to fruition.  The cardboard insert inside the box has no markings on it, there is nothing on the inside of the lid, and the box itself is completely blank and made to look like a nice leather briefcase (albeit made of cardboard) and has no information on it, not even the game's name--the name only appears on the board. If anyone knows anything about this game, please add information because I'm at a loss.&#10;&#10;UPDATE 09-07-2015: Instructions under &quot;More Information.&quot; -- ActorDi&#10;&#10;"

There are 8 different colours, and each colour is assigned a value from 1 to 8. The number printed on the central hexagon is the sum of the values of the three coloured hexagons on that tile (e.g. a blue-blue-red tile would have a value of 11 as blue = 4 and red = 3).&#10;&#10;Game play&#10;The tiles are shuffled and each player is randomly dealt 7 tiles, which he/she puts in front of him/herself face up. The remaining tiles form the draw pile. Players take turns adding one of their tiles to previously laid tiles. Tiles always have to match in two colours, and the new tile has to be laid so that it touches only the edges of the previously laid tile. Players must not fit tiles into each other, there must always be a hexagonal gap between two tiles. A player who cannot add a matching tile continues to draw tiles from the draw pile and adds them to his/her tiles until he/she finds a matching one.&#10;&#10;A round ends when a player has gotten rid of all his/her tiles. Each of the other players sums up the point values of their remaining tiles and scores are written down.

Each player aims to destroy the ego (not really, it is only a game!) of the other players, by laying down insults created from cards in one's hand. The objective: get as many of your cards out of your hand before the end of the round (brought on by someone emptying their hand), so as to have as few points as possible. At the end of the game, whoever sinks the lowest (in score as well as insults) wins!&#10;&#10;Just to make things even more interesting, there are blank cards (helping you to put your own personal touch on your insults) and snappy retorts, which allow you to turn the tables on someone who's just insulted your mother.&#10;&#10;Abuse is a non-collectible card game with eighty cards in a deck, good for four players per each deck in play.&#10;&#10;"
