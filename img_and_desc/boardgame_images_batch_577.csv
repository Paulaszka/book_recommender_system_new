Titanic strikes an iceberg. Water immediately floods into the liner's compartments and the ship is listing to starboard in a worrying way. There is no hope about the outcome. On board, there is widespread panic.&#10;&#10;Alone, or co-operating with other crew members, you must show presence of mind and do the right thing to save as many passengers as possible. Time is short...&#10;&#10;The card game SOS Titanic uses a mechanism similar to Patience, with the cards representing passengers who must be arranged on the decks, then placed in the lifeboats in a particular order. As one of the crew members, you and your teammates need to move and arrange these passengers as quickly as you can. Each section of the Titanic holds a pile of cards of which only the first is available.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a few cards from the main deck and tries to move passengers out of the sinking ship onto the lifeboats. Failing to move at least one passenger or needing to reshuffle the main deck might cause one section of the ship to sink, thus reducing the number of piles available as well as the hopes of those still on board. Players can also use action cards to step in at fateful times when things otherwise seem lost. The game ends when the ship has sunk completely or when all remaining passengers have been saved.&#10;&#10;"

Then the card is put at the back of its caravan. To use the same caravan member again, a player must first use all the other cards on top of that caravan row.&#10;&#10;These actions can influence the player's stock of spice, gold and mules. To keep track of that stock, each player has their own board with wooden markers that are moved accordingly. Actions can also bring new members to the caravans and can enable the player to fulfill one of four delivery request cards from the middle of the table. Finally, there are actions that mix things up a bit, such as by getting rid of a caravan member or even influencing other players' caravans.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has earned 25 points by collecting character cards and fulfilling delivery request cards.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism of Kashgar could be called &quot;open deck-building&quot;.

In short, you experience what a football team experiences.&#10;This is an accurate, well-researched, mathematical representation of association football. All 17 Laws of the Game are incorporated in the play.&#10;In addition to the Basic Game that pits two teams of equal strength against one another, a Tournament Play booklet is included that describes how teams of different strengths can play each other.

Another player&rsquo;s version of events can be challenged by playing an action card. Challenges are resolved by rolling dice, with the winner gaining the card their opponent used.

Land on a Cognosis Challenge square and challenge one of your opponents to answer a question of your choice &ndash; which category do they find the hardest?

It gives children valuable practice in answering CAT type questions in the typical time allowed in the tests and so promotes familiarity and builds confidence. The best bit - as it is fun, children want to play it and don&rsquo;t realise that they are learning and developing with every throw of the dice and every question answered. They also love beating their parents, grandparents or any adult so don&rsquo;t think this is just a game for the children, they will want you to play too.&#10;Cognosis with a twist&#10;Alternative 1&#10;If you're under 12 and want more of a challenge, why not play the game using the 30 second timer&#10;Alternative 2&#10;Going on a long journey but still want to play/practice, why not take a box of cards (you choose which type) and a timer ( you choose which one) and play simply by pulling out a question, turning over the timer and trying to get the right answer before the timer runs out.&#10;Alternative 3&#10;Out of the house and with a friend.

Because capture then involves a combination of two pieces, control of the board is consciously distinguished from simply the ability to move to any given space. Hence, it resembles Chess up to a point but players have to think about relative positioning of their own pieces in combination and of the opponent's pieces to see what areas of the board they control.&#10;&#10;Imperio is the Latin word which refers to having complete control over someone, to the power of life and death in principle.

Players take turns rolling the colour die and move the Zotty pawn to a space of their choice in that colour. If the player has the card that matches the shadow image on that space, they get to place their card on the shadow space. If the player doesn't have the matching card, nothing happens.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
