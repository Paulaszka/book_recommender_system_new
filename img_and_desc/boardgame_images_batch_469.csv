98373,,"game introduction:&#10;In the 31st century, humankind lies scattered throughout the galaxy, fragmented into  individual feudal nations since the fall of the unifying Star Federation. Now, warlords ruling  multiple star systems seek to add to their domain through conquest of other sovereign  planets. Their weapons of choice are gigantic robots, 10 20 meters tall, fully armored and  bristling with guns. The pilots of these &quot;mecha&quot; are the new knights of the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Note: to use these rules, you will need a hexagonal battle map and figures or markers for  the mecha. If playing with miniatures, assume all distances are in inches rather than hexes,  and changes of facing can be up to 90 degrees instead of a single hex face. &#10;&#10;user summary:&#10;War of the Mecha is a minimalist Mecha-themed tactical  micro-wargame.  War of the Mecha reduces the level of complexity of combat as compared to BattleTech, offering a lighter set of rules (one-page for the 1.0 version) while retaining the flavour of the genre.&#10;&#10;"

The deck of cards &ndash; which contains nine each of elephant, cat and mouse, along with three marmosets &ndash; is shuffled and placed in front of the dealer, a position that rotates each round.&#10;&#10;In a round, the dealer deals three cards face-down to different players (except when only two are in the game). Players reveal these cards simultaneously, then they must quickly determine which animal is victorious among those revealed &ndash; elephant, cat, mouse, &quot;no winner&quot; &ndash; and grab the correct coconut. If a player does so, he claims the cards revealed; if he goofs, he receives a penalty point. Collect three of these, and you're booted out of the jungle.&#10;&#10;When the deck runs out, the game ends. Players score three points for each marmoset collected, one point for each other animal and negative one point for each penalty.

The White Elephant Card Game simulates this classic holiday game in a quick, light family card game.&#10;&#10;In the White Elephant Card Game you play the part of a no-good cheapskate, unwilling to spend a measly dime on the people on your gift list. However, you will be attending several White Elephant parties. You can take some junk from your attic and exchange it for treasures to give as gifts. If you &ldquo;play your cards right&rdquo; you could fill your gift list for free and no one will be the wiser!&#10;&#10;Each player has a Gift List Card, a list of three people for whom to acquire gifts. The Gift Cards in their hand constitute their &ldquo;attic&rdquo;. There is one &ldquo;White Elephant Party&rdquo; for each card in a player&rsquo;s attic.&#10;&#10;For each &ldquo;party&rdquo; a player &ldquo;brings a gift to the party&rdquo; by placing one Gift Card from their hand facedown on the table in front of them. The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and &ldquo;opens&rdquo; it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or &ldquo;steal&rdquo; an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.&#10;&#10;This continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played. At the end of the game each player counts only the one highest-numbered Gift Card they received that matches each color on their gift list. The total of these cards is the player&rsquo;s final score. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"
