It&rsquo;s the dying moments of the game. The score is deadlocked and the crowd is screaming. The ball is passed out to the back line: the outcome hinges on what you do next!&#10;&#10;Five Men Standing is for both lovers of the glorious game, and those who have never held a Rugby ball in their hands. Fast paced, competitive, and with no sissy turn taking, this is a game of frantic action and fun! &#10; Each player controls a set of 5 Rugby players, drawn from 2 of the teams competing in the 2011 Tournament. How you manipulate, position, and toss these players will determine the ultimate victor.&#10;&#10;--- How To Play ---&#10; Each player takes a team of five Rugby player figures in their hand, then yells:&#10;&#10;Touch! Players cup their figures in both hands, then reach out and bump hands with their opponent&rsquo;s&#10;Pause! Players withdraw hands from their opponent&rsquo;s&#10;Engage! Players release their figures onto the playing surface&#10;&#10;The figures will bounce around and land in one of four stances, from best to worst: Standing, On Side, On Back, Face Down in the mud.&#10;&#10;Your aim is to yell Stop! when you think you have a combination that will beat your opponent.&#10;&#10;If your first throw wasn&rsquo;t great, don&rsquo;t just sit there moping. This isn&rsquo;t your grandma&rsquo;s tiddly winks, this is Five Men Standing Rugby! Speed and skill count, so grab the figures you want to throw again and see if you can improve your combo. Just remember, you can&rsquo;t pick up figures that are Face-Down in the mud. Those blokes are out of play.&#10;&#10;And be fast, because your opponent will be doing the same and might yell Stop! first...&#10;&#10;Combos are based on Poker, with a couple of twists, and are ranked on the provided Score Board.&#10;&#10;If you win a round, you take a Rugby ball token. When they're gone, the player with the most tokens wins.&#10;&#10;There's also Advanced Scoring Rules for Legends, solitaire rules, and you can add more players by buying more Country Team Packs.&#10;&#10;"

Once the H5N1 zombie virus spread and the zombie population dominated the living within Sunnyville, the zombies staged a revolt and took over the government. The Center for Disease Control, hearing of this epidemic centered in Sunnyville, quarantined the town and the U.S. Government threatened to 'wipe out' the population of zombies to prevent further spreading of this viral nightmare. But the citizens of the newly-formed Zombie Town weren't the stereotypical aggressive zombies portrayed in movies, television and comic books. The citizens of Zombie Town were simply dead and decomposing but still the same as before - upstanding citizens! But with one gruesome exception: the virus gave them an intense craving for living human flesh! Because a mandatory vaccine against the H5N1 zombie virus was given to the human population outside of Zombie Town and the epidemic ceased to exist, human rights activists caught wind of the situation in Sunnyville (aka: Zombie Town) and formed the Save a Zombie Alliance. Millions banded together across the country and persuaded the United States government to sign an unprecedented peace treaty with the zombies. Ashes, the self acclaimed Emperor of Zombie Town, represented the zombies and outlined the truce with the U.S. President. The major clause in the treaty was that zombies would not cross the borders of Zombie Town unless on an approved journey by the U.S. President and they would never hunt living humans for food outside of their borders. Because there were extensive warning signs posted for miles surrounding Zombie Town's borders, there was an addendum in favor of the zombies that if a living human ended up inside the borders of Zombie Town, they were 'fair game' to be hunted, captured and on a zombie's dinner table. Ashes set forth the laws of Zombie Town and the treaty was to be signed by both Ashes and the U.S. President within 24 hours. The citizens were happy to be at peace with the United States Government. Thankfully, they discovered they could sustain themselves by eating pumpkins but pumpkins didn&rsquo;t quite satisfy their appetite for living human flesh. Suppressing their cravings led to increasing irritability and with frustrations escalating in Zombie Town, Ashes knew s/he had to pump up the morale of the citizens. Leary of an impending civil unrest, s/he scheduled the Undead Festival which was a massive town-wide celebration with delicious pumpkin-inspired food, rockin' music and fun zombie games. And this is where the story begins...&#10;&#10;"

The turkey representatives gave it their best shot and pleaded with the humans to make a switch of the traditional Thanksgiving feast to cow, pig or maybe even fish as the main course. After the humans listened to the wild turkey&rsquo;s pleas, they decided to give the turkeys 'temporary immunity' while they engaged in a fun game of 'What Thanksgiving Thing am I.' They continued with the challenging 'Football Mascot Challenge' before settling in for a nice Thanksgiving Dinner. But before they could dig into the Thanksgiving feast, a victim was discovered in the adjacent room! Murder on Thanksgiving?! Disastrous!

The players each start on a branch of the cross by laying out 6 checkers and one horsemen (these 7 pieces are their knights) in the squares of the grid of their branch and their king's space. A player's turn consists of (1)drawing a card, (2)dueling another player's knight (optional), (3)turning in any pairs of cards you may have for more knights, and (4) moving any one knight to either an adjacent space or any available green space on the board, one of which allows a player to draw an extra card on their turn.&#10;&#10;When a player starts a duel with another player, they each select a card from their hand, and higher card wins (king is high).  Ties are draws and both cards are discarded.  Re-dueling is optional. The winner draws a card from the draw pile AND takes both cards used in the duel (placed in 'pair's pile'), and loser removes their knight from the board.&#10;&#10;Certain spaces on the board have numbers on them which require the attacker to play a card of that value or higher, while the defender may play any card value. Jokers may be played at any time to steal a random card from an opponent's hand.&#10;&#10;After dueling, if you have any pairs (from either your hand or your 'pair's pile' ) you may turn as many as you wish in for more knights which are then placed in any space adjacent to another of your own knights.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to have your knights occupying all four king spaces on the board.  You must always occupy at least one king space on the board, but not necessarily the one you started with.  If a person loses a duel for their last king space, all of their knights are removed from the board, and their cards are given to the winner of the duel.&#10;&#10;"

Write each player's name in the Score-Keeper.&#10;3 - The youngest player takes the Target Disc first. They will be the first to throw the disc and their Flickin' Chicken.&#10;&#10;PLAYING EACH ROUND&#10;1 - Flickin' Chicken is played in 9 rounds. The person with the lowest score after nine rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;2 - At the start of each round, throw the Target Disc as far as you can. For the first round, the youngest player throws first. For subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round, play paper-scissor-rock, flip a coin or other tie-breaking ritual to determinate the thrower. Greco-Roman Wrestling is not reccomended.&#10;&#10;3 - Taking turns, and starting with the Target Disc thrower, each player throws their Flickin' Chicken at the Target Disc, trying to land any part of their chicken on the disc. If you land any part of your Flickin' Chicken on the Target Disc on your first throw, this is a &quot;Pollo-In-One&quot;. Everyone should congratulate you, as it's quite a feat.&#10;&#10;4 - After everyone has thrown, it is now time for your next throw (if needed). The player whose chicken landed furthest from the target disc will go next (throwing from where the chicken landed) continuing with the next furthest player, so forth and so on.&#10;&#10;5 - Repeat this until everyone has landed any part of their Flickin' Chicken onto the Target Disc. Once you hit the target disc, remove your chicken from play. Keep track of your throws as each throw is equal to one point.&#10;&#10;6 - When every player has landed their chicken on the target the round is over. It is now time to score the round.&#10;&#10;7 - Repeat the above until you have played all nine-rounds.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;1 - The target Disc has 2 sides, a Bonus side and a Penalty side. Each round is different depending on which side of the Target Disc is facing up after it lands!&#10;&#10;2 - If any part of your Flickin' Chicken is TOUCHING the center white circle of the Target Disc then score accordingly and as follows:&#10;&quot;Penalty +1&quot; - Add one point to your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Penalty Circle.&#10;&quot;Bonus -1&quot; - Deduce one point from your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Bonus Circle.&#10;&#10;3 - After determining if any Bonus or Penalty points apply to a players score, write their score in the Score-Keeper using the including pencil.&#10;&#10;4 - After 9 rounds of play, tally up the players' scores. The player with the lowest score wins! (from the Rules-book)&#10;&#10;"
