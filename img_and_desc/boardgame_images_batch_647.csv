However, in response to requests from play-testers, they have been extended to cover everything between the biblical era and the late medieval period.&#10;&#10;They have been designed so that they can be used for anything from solo play with 100 or so miniatures through to huge games with 3000 plus miniatures and up to 5 players a side. A square grid has been used to promote speed of play. This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages for use with a variety of rule systems to be used together on the same battlefield.&#10;&#10;Absolutely no dice are used in To the Strongest! Instead, an innovative (and entertaining) mechanism uses playing cards to activate units, which can each potentially move or fight multiple times during the same turn. Shooting and melees are resolved quickly and decisively, amidst a flurry of playing cards....&#10;&#10;Despite their relative simplicity, the author believes that these rules capture the essential flavour of an ancient or medieval battle, and that the more seasoned gamer will find more than enough command decisions to entertain and challenge him. He wishes that players may enjoy very many happy games, and may victory always fall to the strongest!&#10;&#10;"

Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement &mdash; whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress &mdash; you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.&#10;&#10;"

These theatres of operation are considered to be minor since they occurred far from the Emperor&rsquo;s view who was engaged in the north of France. Nevertheless, important and little-known battles took place there where the young Marie-Louise, the conscripts of the French army, displayed extraordinary courage. The first campaign, that of Marshal Augereau in France, recounts in three scenarios the march on the flanks of the Austrian army engaged against Napoleon.&#10;&#10;In the first, the &ldquo;Lion of Castiglione&rdquo; must seize Geneva to cover his march on the enemy lines of communication. The second relates the Austrians&rsquo; offensive return from Dijon and the fall of Lyon after the battle of Limonest. The third covers the whole campaign from the beginnings of Augereau&rsquo;s timid offensive to the loss of the &ldquo;capital of the Gauls&rdquo;. The second campaign, led by Eug&egrave;ne de Beauharnais, describes the fierce combats for the supremacy of northern Italy. Threatened at his rear by the betrayal of Murat who is moving up from the south of the &ldquo;boot&rdquo; with his Neapolitans, Eug&egrave;ne withdrew from Verona to Mantua. The first scenario, very brief, simulates the about-turn of the French on the Mincio to counter the Austrian advance. The second covers the whole campaign from the evacuation of Verona to the victories of Eug&egrave;ne against various enemy threats.&#10;&#10;With this new volume, The Marshals series evolves. The more imposing strengths of these campaigns required some adaptations that allowed for simulating the march of an entire army corps. These new rules are compatible with the previous modules with some minor adaptations.&#10;&#10;"

You&rsquo;ve used some tactics you&rsquo;re not proud of, but it&rsquo;s always gotten the job done. Now some of the other detectives are on a case that might reveal your dirty little secret. Can&rsquo;t let that happen, so better you expose their secret first. At least your partner has your back; seems it&rsquo;s hard to find someone you can rely on in this department.&#10;&#10;Players will work with their partner to use deduction and rough tactics to uncover your opponents&rsquo; cards, while using misdirection to cover your own tracks. Players must gather evidence, information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and choose the right times to make accusations. Be careful about it, though, as every action you take has a trade-off, and often this gives your opponents knowledge to use against you. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Aim of the GameYou (and your partner) are trying to have the most Points at the end of the game. Points are gained by keeping your most valuable card secret until the end of the game, and using collected evidence to remove your opponents&rsquo; cards. During the game you&rsquo;ll use your chosen Action cards to gain information about opponents&rsquo; cards, and tactically position your cards to confound your opponents and open up new Actions for you to use. The game ends immediately after all the Evidence is collected.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay OverviewEach player has the same 8 Action cards. They are each numbered with the Time &ndash; 1 a.m. up to 8 a.m. This Time doubles as the card&rsquo;s value in points if it scores at the end of the game. Players will choose 5 cards to play with each game, keeping their choices secret. &#10;The game begins with a shared Evidence pool and every player with five face-down hidden cards: three forming a Front Line row and two making a Back Office row. In a 3- or 4-player game, there is also a Chief&rsquo;s Badge in the centre of play that is given to a player whenever they lose a card.&#10;&#10;In turn, players take up to 2 unique actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Collect an Evidence&#10;     Accuse an opponent&rsquo;s card&#10;     Use a particular card from your Front Line (Players can use 2 different cards on their turn, just not the same one twice).&#10;&#10;&#10;Or they can spend BOTH actions to:&#10;&#10;     Cover their tracks (rearrange 3 of their cards and flip them upside down again)&#10;     Claim the Chief&rsquo;s badge from another player, or use the Chief&rsquo;s badge as any card action (In 3- 4-player games).&#10;&#10;&#10;Early in the game, players will primarily collect Evidence and use their Front Line cards to gain information. Later, they&rsquo;ll manipulate setups and try to use Evidence to eliminate cards from play. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Evidence&#10;&#10;Collecting Evidence is crucial to victory, because you need it to make accusations. By itself, Evidence is worth 1 point for every 2 you have. But if you successfully use one to accuse an opponent, it goes into your Evidence Locker and is worth a full point. If you accuse incorrectly, however, the Evidence goes to your opponent.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Accusations&#10;To win you&rsquo;ll need to reduce your opponents&rsquo; score by eliminating their high value cards. You can make random guesses, but that wastes both valuable Evidence and actions. Instead, you&rsquo;ll want to spend actions using your cards to get information first. Then just before they cover their tracks to remove what you know, you make an accusation. If you&rsquo;re right the Evidence doubles in value to a full point. But if you&rsquo;re wrong, it&rsquo;s lost to your opponent. Or worse, if you mis-accuse their Red Herring card, they get an additional Evidence from the pool.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Using a card&#10;&#10;You can use any card that&rsquo;s still hidden in your Front line &ndash; but be careful! Don&rsquo;t point at it, flip it, or do anything that might indicate WHICH card you&rsquo;re using. Unless, that is, you&rsquo;re trying to mislead your opponent.&#10;&#10;The low value/Time cards are powerful actions, as they will get you solid information like the Time difference between 2 cards of an opponent, or which cards in their Front line have &ldquo;finger-prints&rdquo; on them. This will help you deduce their cards, while other actions like the Frame-up, provide you with tactical moves to reposition some of your &ndash; or an opponent&rsquo;s &ndash; cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Bluffing?&#10;&#10;In the basic game you are only able to take the actions of cards you legitimately have in your Front Line. This provides a more deduction and tactical game. However, optional bluffing rules allow players to take any action they wish &ndash; legal or not. But be careful that your opponent doesn&rsquo;t call you out that you&rsquo;re lying, or you&rsquo;ll start losing cards! &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Covering your tracks&#10;&#10;As your valuable cards and actions are revealed by opponents, or as they gain more information, you&rsquo;ll want to get a little breathing room. Covering your tracks may take your whole turn but it lets you choose 3 of your cards (Front line or in your reserved Back Office) to hide again and place wherever you like. It&rsquo;s a great way to get back in the game, or foil an opponent before they have the chance to accuse you.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Chief&rsquo;s badge&#10;The Chief would prefer that her detectives are focused on other criminal matters, and so in 3- and 4-player games, whenever a player loses a card to an accusation they receive the Chief&rsquo;s badge for protection. A player with the Chief&rsquo;s badge cannot be accused, and can use both their actions to activate the badge as any card &ndash; in play or not.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;End of the GameOnce the last Evidence token is claimed, the game ends. It&rsquo;s a timer, as once collected, Evidence never re-enters the central pool. &#10;Players score most of their points from the highest card they managed to keep hidden in their Front Line at the end of the game. Note that the Dirty Secret card is valued at 4 a.m., but if IT is the scoring card (highest one hidden), it scores an extra 7 points. The trick, of course, is making sure it&rsquo;s both hidden AND the highest Time in the front at game-end.&#10;&#10;Each Players also score points for their collected Evidence&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 per 2 unused Evidence&#10;     1 per Evidence in locker (used to successfully accuse)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Summary&#10;&#10;Dirty Little Secrets is a game of &lsquo;playing the player&rsquo; as much as it is a game about your card-play. Good players are highly responsive to their opponents, and learn to push and prod player behaviours to their favour. With only 8 cards, it&rsquo;s not about having the right card &ndash; it&rsquo;s about knowing when and how to use it.&#10;&#10;For rookies, there is a suggested set of cards to use that have more straight-forward actions that let these players be effective until they learn some of their own tricks and strategies.&#10;&#10;"

In Bushido, the fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes, men and women of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the very fabric of the universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In the world of Bushido, the delicate tapestry of Ki &ndash; and thus the universe itself &ndash;is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to you to protect it &ndash; or help rip it apart. In a game of Bushido, nothing less than the universe itself is at stake. Are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?&#10;&#10;There are currently nine factions at war within the Jwar Isles:&#10;&#10;The prefecture of Ryu&#10;The Dragon Clan won the rights to colonize the Westward Isles in a series of duels with their rivals, the Shiho Clan. However, when the Emperor's vessel expired, and his young heir, too young and inexperienced to concern himself with the petty disputes at the fringes of his lands, the promise of sole settlement rights died with him. The newly formed Prefecture of Ryu found themselves yet again in conflict with their old enemies, the Shiho Clan. Now, the Prefecture&rsquo;s grasp of power is weakened, due to the recent Tsunami. Their forces are in disarray, they are fighting on all fronts in the aftermath of the disaster. But still the men and women of the Dragon are ready to take their place at Destiny&rsquo;s table, uniting the human world by defending it against all threats.&#10;&#10;The Temple of Ro-Kan&#10;The serene martial artist masters of the Ro-Kan have long viewed themselves as above all mortal and mundane conflicts. Now, following the Han civil war, the rise of the Cult of Yurei, and the incursion of the Savage Wave, the monks of Ro-Kan are being dragged into the clandestine wars of universal balance &ndash; a war in which they will reluctantly turn out to be key players. The monks follow an age-old path and know the secrets of Ki better than any others, but they are few and divided &ndash; will they be able to unite and join forces before it is too late?&#10;&#10;The Savage Wave&#10;They take the form of evil creatures of myth and folklore. From where they come or why, no-one knows, but one thing is for certain, the wave crushes everything in its path. The Oni and Bakemono demon-creatures that make up the bulk of the Savage Wave appear bent on the destruction of humankind and all that is holy, but they are not mindless &ndash; as many opponents have found out at great pain, the Savage Wave is cunning and organized, and it operates according to its own weird and unknowable logic.

If it was the Kami that caused the snake like changes or whether it has simply exaggerated the Ito&rsquo;s natural affinity is unknown.

Famed arenas where colossal Jumo warriors clash in a brutal dance, or an array of fighting beasts struggle in a battle to the death. Water houses where ones wildest fantasies can become reality with the touch of a Rose. Their power lies not the in military might of the Ito, Takashi or Minimoto but in the stranglehold they have on trade. And not only the trade of goods, but of the secrets and whispers of even the most pious. Some would liken the Silvermoon to the flip of a coin.

Silently they have over seen the rise and fall of innumerable clans, the petty squabbles of mortals bare no relevance to their goal. Gifted with generations of knowledge passed down through the written teachings of the Karasu Shugenja and oral histories of the Koroko Shisai the Tengu hold the secrets of the world in the their high homes.&#10;&#10;Now stirred into action, one can only imagine the danger that looms that has rustled the Tengu to war.&#10;&#10;Jung Pirates&#10;When years passed without word of the Jung, they were considered lost, their return under the mon of the giant squid surprised everyone. They have reaped what they need from the traders on the seas of the Jwar Isles, forcing the Shiho to label them pirates. Their fleets are faster and their knowledge of the Isles&rsquo; waters are unparalleled by all but perhaps the Carp clan, allowing them to evade the larger, less experienced junks of the Prefecture. Long years away from the courts of the Jwar Isles have left the Jung rough around the edges but they have not forgotten their ancestry.&#10;&#10;Kage Kaze Zoku&#10;The Kage Kaze Zoku (Shadow wind clan) are deadly ninjas with a grudge against just about everybody.&#10;&#10;"

Whoever finishes first is the winner. There are also cards what add or substract the movements of players&acute;s pawns in this game.&#10;&#10;A crowd-funded &lsquo;patriotic&rsquo; board game about reclaiming Estonia after a Russian invasion has become a hit in the Baltic state, feeding on popular fears about the geopolitical ambitions of the country&rsquo;s eastern neighbor.&#10;&#10;Named &lsquo;Comrade Pu conquers Estonia&rsquo; &ndash; the monicker is a popular local nickname for Vladimir Putin &ndash; the board game features a recognizable caricature of the Russian president on the front of its box, though it does not mention him by name.&#10;&#10;In a variant of Snakes and Ladders, the players have to &lsquo;fight back&rsquo; from the Western border of the state, which became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991, with the help of dice. Instead of ladders, players pull out cards that may help or hinder their progress. &ldquo;Pu wins the Nobel Peace Prize&rdquo; sets the player one step back, while &ldquo;Kazakhstan is prevented from joining Russia&rsquo;s side&rdquo; lets them get one ahead.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The idea of the game was born during the events of last spring in Ukraine,&rdquo; Taavi Emajoe told the Russian-language Delfi website in Estonia. &ldquo;We hope people find the game humorous. There is nothing unethical about political satire.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Emajoe, who was working on another game with two other young designers, before the spark of inspiration, says the game wouldn&rsquo;t have worked without Putin.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We chose Putin not to create animosity towards him, but because he is such a multi-dimensional political figure. Most of the ideas in the game are derived directly from his persona.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;After easily passing the &euro;1,500 (US$1,734) funding requirement on the local version of Kickstarter, the game has now hit the shelves, retailing at &euro;23.45 ($27).&#10;&#10;The manager of Tallinn&rsquo;s leading Apollo bookshop, Liis Paas, told Delfi that the game has been &ldquo;attracting a heightened level of attention&rdquo; from curious shoppers. However, the manager did not elaborate whether interest had transformed into sales.&#10;&#10;Estonia is historically sensitive about being invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and local politicians still frequently evoke the specter of a Russian invasion, despite the country being a member of NATO and the EU.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, satirical board games about Putin &ndash; often based on Snakes and Ladders &ndash; have previously appeared in Russian and Western media following a whirlwind year for the Kremlin, mostly as playful illustrations, not actual games to be played with pieces and dice.&#10;&#10;Satirical board games have enjoyed a mixed history, with acclaim depending largely on the players&rsquo; political orientation. The US board game War on Terror &ndash; which satirizes US foreign policy and forces players to temporarily don balaclavas as they face American wrath &ndash; is still popular, while the pre-WWII Juden Raus, in which German players had to &ldquo;round up Jews&rdquo; and &ldquo;push them off the board&rdquo; enjoys a different sort of notoriety.&#10;&#10;"
