You are now the Manager of your own team. You can make every choice that a major league manager makes. You decide when to HIT and RUN, whet to STEAL a base, or when to use your all important PINCH HITTERS! This game is as easy to play as real baseball. It's hours of family fun at home and at parties, for everyone.&#10;&#10;Each manager places his four base runner discs in the dug out. The pinch hitter is placed in the bull pen and moved up one space as they are used. Place the out disc at the top of the playing field and move it as outs are made. The manager whose team is at bat should place his first batter at home plate (H). Take the dice and say aloud which play he is trying from the ten selection at the top of the game board. Example: Aloud &quot;Bunt for hit&quot;, now pitch the dice. Combine the face value of the dice roll and find the result of the play on the board under the play selection. Each time a base runner crosses home plate one run is scored to that team.&#10;&#10;"

The second release would have been the Wrath of the Gods expansion set.&#10;&#10;Cards were divided into three different levels: Level 1 was mere mortals, Level 2 was powerful creatures and heroes, and Level 3 was the realm of the gods. Defeating an opponent at each level would give a player access to the next level of characters and cards. Location and Action cards would supplement a player's battle tactics.&#10;&#10;A pre-release set of 104 cards was published and demo decks were shown at game stores. A two-day tournament was held in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The game was scheduled to be in stores by Summer 2001, then Summer 2002, then Winter 2003. The project was cancelled before its official release.&#10;&#10;"

Which is scarier: zombies or werewolves? For generations this has puzzled commoner and philosopher alike. But now, the question will be answered. Which supernatural entity has the power to cause the most terror in the unsuspecting citizens of some nameless town? Only you can decide.&#10;&#10;Zombies vs Werewolves is a fast-paced card game for 2 players that takes roughly 15 minutes (or less) to play. It&rsquo;s simple, competitive, and all about determining who can score the most Terror Points before the game ends by frightening an assortment of random Citizens.&#10;&#10;Play begins by selecting 6 Citizen cards at random and laying them out on the table face up. Each person chooses one deck of cards (either Zombies or Werewolves) to play with. During each player's turn, they will be able to play a card from their hand and then draw back up to a hand limit of 5 cards. Cards played are either Terror cards (cards with a number from 2-6 and 8) or Special Event cards (unique cards with special abilities that can be used once a game each). Each side plays Terror cards on Citizens to try and meet or exceed the Citizen's Courage rating; the player that meets or exceeds the Courage rating first frightens that Citizen and prevents the other player from claiming them at the end of the game. Play continues until all Citizen cards have been frightened. Then the total Terror points played on all frightened Citizens is added up on each side.&#10;&#10;The player with the most Terror Points at the end will be declared the victor, proving once and for all (or until you play again) that their side is the scarier of the two.&#10;&#10;"

In this game, two players take turns drawing and placing cards, and construct a gridwork of tracks on the table over which their commuters and other pieces navigate.&#10;&#10;The game uses 2 decks of ordinary playing cards, though more (or I guess fewer) could be done. Each player has a chess king representing his &quot;commuter&quot; and several checkers that act as blockers.&#10;&#10;One player is &quot;black&quot; the other &quot;red&quot;. The players simply take turns drawing cards from the deck, and the player whose color matches the card chooses how to use it. The cards can be used to build a road grid, or to move your commuter, or a blocker. You can only move your commuter onto a card by discarding a drawn card with an equal or higher number. Thus, players try to use high cards either to hinder the opponent's moves, or to move their own commuter. Low cards are used to build out one's own road grid.&#10;&#10;"

Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!&#10;&#10;Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.&#10;&#10;In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!&#10;&#10;Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.&#10;&#10;On your turn:&#10;&#10;     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. &#10;     Then take one action:&#10;         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.&#10;         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.&#10;         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.&#10;         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated. Most VP wins!&#10;&#10;"

Who will flirt the best, gain the most flirting points and become the &quot;best&quot; couple?&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player receives a character (or two characters in a three-player game), two hearts belonging to that character and two relationship tokens, and a pawn, which is placed on the board. Then, each player thinks up a term of endearment for himself. When players address each other, they should use this term of endearment. A player who fails to do so correctly loses a relationship point.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. On his turn, a player rolls two dice, picks one, and move his pawn as many spaces as the die shows. (In a three-player game, the player rolls one die, and selects one of his pawns to move.) After moving the pawn, the player may flirt with one character of the opposite sex whose pawn is on the same space or an adjacent space. If he does so, this strengthens the relationship between the two characters. This is measured by placing flirting points on the &quot;love barometer&quot;. If two characters have four flirting points, they fall in love. After four more points, they get engaged, and after another four points, they get married.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, if the pawn has landed on a heart space, the player may either give one of his hearts to another player, or ask for a heart from another player (who then has to give one of his hearts to the asker).&#10;&#10;If the pawn has landed on a text message space, the player draws one of the text message cards, reads it out loud and places it face-down in front of him.

Details on why this is important in the description.&#10;&#10;Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of &quot;red stars&quot;, otherwise known as victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.&#10;&#10;What makes this game unique is that when powers are chosen, players must choose one of their faction's two powers, affix that power's sticker to their faction card, then destroy the card that has the other rule on it &ndash; and by destroy, the rules mean what they say: &quot;If a card is DESTROYED, it is removed from the game permanently. Rip it up. Throw it in the trash.&quot; This key concept permeates through the game. Some things you do in a game will affect it temporarily, while others will affect it permanently. These changes may include boosting the resources of a country (for recruiting troops in lieu of the older &quot;match three symbols&quot; style of recruiting), adding bonuses or penalties to defending die rolls to countries, or adding permanent continent troop bonuses that may affect all players.&#10;&#10;The rule book itself is also designed to change as the game continues, with blocks of blank space on the pages to allow for rules additions or changes. Entire sections of rules will not take effect until later in the game. The game box contains different sealed packages and compartments, each with a written condition for opening. The rule book indicates that these contain the rule additions, additional faction powers, and other things that should not be discussed here for spoiler protection.&#10;&#10;The winner of each of the first 15 games receives a &quot;major bonus,&quot; such as founding a major city (which only he will be allowed to start on in future games), deleting a permanent modifier from the board, destroying a country card (preventing it from providing any resources towards purchasing troops in future games), changing a continent troop bonus, or naming a continent, which gives that player a troop bonus in future games. Players who did not win but were not eliminated are allowed to make minor changes to the world, such as founding a minor city or adding resources to a country.&#10;&#10;It should be noted that although cards are ripped up over the course of the game, there are so many cards added via the sealed packages, that the game does not suffer. Nor is this a &quot;disposable&quot; game, merely a customized one. The game can continue to change beyond the 15 game campaign, and even when it finally does stop changing, you still have a copy of Risk that is completely unique.&#10;&#10;Initial games take approximately 30-90 minutes to play, which includes a brief rules explanation and setup.&#10;&#10;"
