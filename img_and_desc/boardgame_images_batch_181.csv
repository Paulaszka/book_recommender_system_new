A round is completed when each player has used three cards.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game the Starting Player deals each player six cards.  Each player chooses three of these cards to use in round one, and puts aside the remaining three cards - you will use the second set of three cards in round two.&#10;&#10;In your turn, you select and play one card from your hand.  Then the player on your left takes a turn, and so on, until each player has played all three of their cards in hand.&#10;&#10;When you play a card, you choose one of four actions:&#10;A    Place pieces into a region;&#10;B    Play a Stone of Destiny card to swap 2 pieces in a region;&#10;C    Discard the card and pay 4 cumals to declare an amnesty that releases all captives from a region;&#10;D    Discard the card to gain 2 cumals.&#10;&#10;If you placed or swapped pieces, you may pay the card's Activation Cost to promote from two of your adjacent pieces to the space immediately above them.  For example, if you placed a herdsman next to another of your herdsmen, you could pay the Activation Cost and put a piece above both herdsmen into the space at the warrior level.  The object is to gain a King in the region by promoting to the King space.&#10;&#10;By placing or promoting pieces you might capture opposing pieces and release those of your own that have been previously captured.&#10;&#10;After each player has played the three cards in hand, there is an End of Round sequence.  Each region may have a traitor.  The player who owns the traitor swaps one of their pieces for an opponent's piece and may then pay to promote from the traitor's space.  Once all traitors have been actioned, players collect income, dependent on the number of pieces they have on the board and their rank.  Then remove pieces from any region containing a new King; the player with the new King establishes a garrison in the region, captives are removed and exchange or ransom of prisoners may occur.  Finally the Starting Player chooses a new Starting Player for the next round.  A new round then begins, using the three cards set aside by each player if they remain, or by dealing another six cards to each player and splitting them into two sets of three as at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has a King in two different regions.&#10;&#10;"

On your turn you place a sneeze card into either the upwind pool (which will make people sneeze immediately) or the downwind pool (which is safe until the wind changes).&#10;&#10;If all of your allergy cards are matched by cards in the upwind pool then you sneeze, that pool clears, you draw another allergy card and both you and the player who made you sneeze draw an 'And Now' (event) card.  These can be played on your turn instead of flipping an allergy card to effect the course of the game (e.g. you hold your breath to avoid sneezing, or play a 'mean trick' to double the effect of one of the cards than an opponent is allergic to).&#10;&#10;When a player with four allergies sneezes they are out--at that point the game switches to 'sudden death' with any player who sneezes being eliminated.&#10;&#10;This is clearly a kids game, but with a few twists of strategy to keep everybody interested, especially around management of 'And Now' cards, and preparing for the switch into the sudden death end game.&#10;&#10;"

The soup was lumpy and the main course was stodgy and overcooked. Now dessert is served&mdash;the table is laden with Chocolate Mousse, Rice Pudding, Cherry Pie, Fruit Salad and so much more. The guests start to grin wickedly&hellip;&#10;&#10;The object of Splat! is to furiously flinging food at other players while dodging food they are throwing back at you. The more food that hits you, the messier you get. At the end of the game, the cleanest players are allowed to think that they&rsquo;ve won.&#10;&#10;The game uses three types of cards:&#10;&#10;Food Cards : Each food card has a special power which takes effect when the food is either eaten, or is thrown at another player and hits.  Some of these powers are long lasting while others are instant (e.g. the banana split is vitamin fortified and so increases a players hand size, while the revolutionary cupcakes contain added additives which force you to throw all your food at other players). Food cards are either green (generally beneficial powers) and red (generally not beneficial).&#10;&#10;And Then Cards : Event cards which can be played during the food throwing process to impact the course of the game.  These cards act as interrupts which provide much of the interactive story telling character of the game (e.g. Amy throws Birthday Cake at Clare but Bob catches it and throws it back at Amy on his next turn). These cards can also be played as dodges to avoid food that is thrown at you.&#10;&#10;Object Cards : Throughout the game players may also stand in front of objects (e.g. The Children, The Gnu, Uncle Harry or The Mirror).  If a player standing in front of an object dodges then the food hits the object instead and the thrower gets yelled at by either the Host or the Hostess--forcing them to discard all their And Then cards and eat a food (if they have one).&#10;&#10;Each player has a 'You' card with 5 hit locations--when food hits someone the thrower rolls to see where (Head, 2 x Arms, 2 x Legs, 1's miss).  Food which hits a location that is already messy replaces the previous food.&#10;&#10;The Butler (Jeeves) also has a hit location card--players may choose to throw food at him through the game and in addition any food that is thrown which does not hit a player or an object may hit Jeeves instead.  Once Jeeves is completely covered with food he chases the players out of the house, ending the game.&#10;&#10;Splat! is a reworking of Ed Carter's 1992 food-fight card game, Kersplatt!&#10;&#10;&#10;"
