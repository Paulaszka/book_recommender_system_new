Instead, this game features profit and loss statements that are triggered by certain fields. They change share values, resulting in players paying money into or getting money from a money pool. There are also pool cards triggering the profit and loss statements of shares of one color.&#10;Another non-Monopoly concept is that of shortcut fields (Warnowtunnel, Scandlines ferry) that allow the players to quickly move over a section of the board for a small fee.&#10;&#10;"

Players represent up to four factions: the Reds (Communists), Siberian Whites (monarchists), Southern Whites, or Northern Whites. Each turn represents three months, and the game begins in Summer of 1918 and concludes, should one player not win outright, in the Spring 1921 turn. This 3-4 hour game thus lasts a maximum of twelve turns.&#10;&#10;Players command infantry and cavalry armies, and for some factions fleets and aircraft. Leaders assist these units in movement and combat over land areas and sea zones. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for armies, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Factions thus use manpower to rebuild forces, and money to finance their actions. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor, with hits reducing them in strength or eliminating them outright. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is also rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there).&#10;&#10;Finally, to keep the game from becoming too &quot;Risk&quot;-like, players can play various event cards.  Having the ability to fight through adversity makes one a powerful adversary in Red Russia.&#10;&#10;"

The primary goal of the game is to score points by answering questions on the above subjects, with individual turn actions keyed by a basic roll-and-move mechanic.&#10;&#10;The significant twist in the game is that each player takes one of twenty cards sets, each set consisting of 11 cards.  Ten are clue cards related to a single black historical figure or celebrity.  Another card in each set has the person's name and picture.  During the game, the other players have the opportunity privately or publicly hear the clues and try to guess the character.  The clues are divulged based on the players answers to toss-up questions on cards (&quot;Words of Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Go Back to your Roots&quot;), drawn when they land on the corresponding squares.  Other squares allow free guessing of secret identities, answering questions for additional points, and other more typical roll-and-move actions.  Points for answers/guesses are tallied on paper for as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;This game appears to have a good balance between movement, deduction, and trivia mechanics.  An unfortunate rule is that players who have their secret identities guessed are then out of the game, so it would help to have the most obscure figure possible. (There were two of twenty I was completely unfamiliar with, and a couple more I needed a clue to recognize.)&#10;&#10;There will not be much replay after all the IDs have been used...but if that happens the game will have largely succeeded in it primary educational goal.&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts in a system at a corner of the map and expands outward from there.&#10;&#10;Each player represents a different spacefaring race/organization - the Terrans, the Olso Empire, the Federation (changed to the Confederation in the second edition), and the Tholians (changed to the Lothians in the second edition).  Each has a different set of units they can build, with varying capabilities - ships are rated for space combat, ground (bombardment) combat, drive system, and what kind of damage they take from the various combat results.&#10;&#10;When a star is explored a card is drawn which determines the class of the inhabitable world found there and, if inhabited, its attitude to each of the players.  In addition to the attitude the value of each kind of planet varies by player.&#10;&#10;There are three different long-range movement systems in the game - warp drive, jump drive (similar to warp drive but much less accurate), and stargates, which have to be built and carried to where you want to use them.  Each player uses one of the three systems for their ships.&#10;&#10;The second edition, in addition to changing the names of two of the races, changed some of the ship designs which were similar to Star Trek and Star Wars ships. It also changed the name of the game to The Conquest and Exploration of Space.&#10;&#10;"

By playing out rows, each of which consist of 6 gangsters, players try to gain a majority through their most valuable gangsters. But careful! To gain powerful positions, sometimes sharpshooting is needed. The goal of the game is to become the most powerful of all, Al Capone. Tactics, strategy and cold-bloodedness will be required if you want to be celebrated as the boss of bosses in this game.&#10;&#10;What gives the game its flair, apart from the real metal munitions, is the deft touch of the illustrator as well as court artist Robert Nippoldt. From corrupt mayor William Hale &quot;Big Bill&quot; Thompson to Boss of Bosses Al &quot;Scarface&quot; Capone, all of the major gangsters of this lead-filled time are represented. The well-known portraits are taken from the eponymous book &quot;Gangster. The Bosses of Chicago&quot; by Robert Nippoldt, and give the game a sheen of authenticity.
