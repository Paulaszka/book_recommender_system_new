All the animals of the Greater Rift Valley, big and small, have gathered to watch the hedgehogs take the field. But hedgehogs are very slow creatures. And the other animals are growing impatient!  So one by one, the animals begin to push the hedgehogs along the forest floor, hoping to finish the race before tea time.&#10;&#10;In this preschool game, each player picks their favorite hedgehog and lines it up at the beginning of the jungle track track.  A shuffled deck of animal cards, as well as the big and small animal disks, wait off to the side, cheering on the racers.  On your turn, flip over the top animal card and find the matching animal disk. Then use that animal to push the hedgehogs further along the track, but only as far as the canopy!  As more and more animals crowd in behind the little hedgehogs, they'll get shoved, pushed, and jostled further and further down the field until one unlikely hedgehog pops out the other end of the racetrack and is declared the winner.  If it's your hedgehog, you win!&#10;&#10;Safari Sprint features all real world plants and animals that can be found in the Greater Rift Valley of Africa.  The language free cards display each animal's range, size, and diet.  Additional facts about the animals can be found inside the game's instruction sheet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

One player is the Seeker and the others are Hiders.  As a Hider you are randomly dealt a bean. It might be a silent bean, but it also might be one of the farting kind.  Everyone starts at a predetermined base, then presses the button on their bean and runs off to hide while the Seeker closes their eyes and counts.&#10;&#10;While you try to hide, your bean may be unable to control itself and continuously let out little farts and giggles.  Or you may have a silent bean.  Either way, try to get back to base without being tagged by the Seeker.  If the Seeker tags you before you get back to base, they'll collect your bean.  If you make it back safely, you can exchange your bean for its matching score card.&#10;&#10;Once all players have been tagged or returned to base, the round ends and each player earns points based on how well they did that round.  The Seeker earns points for any beans they collected (silent beans are worth more than loud ones).  Seekers earn points for any card they collected (loud bean cards are worth more than silent ones).  Continue playing until each player has had a turn as the Seeker, adding up the points you earn each round, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
