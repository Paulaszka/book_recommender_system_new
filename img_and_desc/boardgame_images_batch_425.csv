Now it will take your ingenuity and resourcefulness to track down and stop whoever did this before they escape.&#10;&#10;In this dexterity-based deduction game, players are attempting to find the missing plans, which spy stole them, and the transportation they&rsquo;ve used to escape.  To achieve this, players flick their Player Token and attempt to strike face-down Evidence Chips.  By keeping track of which chips are in the play area, they are able to deduce the missing Plans, Spy, and Transportation chips; the first to guess correctly wins the game.  If everyone fails, however, the spy escapes and everyone loses!&#10;&#10;SpyFlick is designed by Lucio Rodriguez, and is scheduled for release (self-published) in 2010.&#10;&#10;"

They play these cards in turn, refilling their hand as they play. Each card adds to the total sum. The player who plays a card that makes the sum exceed 12 (Cirno can't count to more than twelve) loses and gets a loss point. The game ends when someone has three loss points.&#10;&#10;Apart from the numbered cards, there are the &quot;divide by 2&quot; card, the &quot;multiply by 2&quot; card, and then there are the special cards &quot;Turn&quot; (reverse play order), &quot;Pass&quot; (play passes to the next player), &quot;Shot&quot; (choose a player, it's now his turn) and &quot;Double&quot; (next player has to play two cards). The special cards you draw when you lose a round can also be used as special cards. Also, the card with a 9 in a circle makes the total a nine - always. Whenever a 9 is involved, Cirno will full of self-confidence reply &quot;nine&quot;.&#10;&#10;This game is based on the flash animation &quot;Cirno's Perfect Math Classroom&quot; in which the character Cirno tries to learn math by adding and subtracting. The flash animation is in turn based on an internet meme regarding one of the boss characters from the video game &quot;Embodiment of Scarlet Devil&quot;, a home made shooting game for Windows. A note in the manual caused the fan base to declare Cirno being a total dimwit, closely associated with the number 9, mostly depicted in a circle.&#10;&#10;Translated box back:&#10;Cirno's Math Game ~ let's study with your friends&#10;is a game where Cirno studies math (mostly addition) with her friends because she one day thought that&#10;I'm not stupid! I know! Math is clever!&#10;&#10;The rules are simple. Each turn, play a card, draw a card. The card's number is added to the sum total, and the player who plays a card which causes the total to exceed Cirno's comprehension span (12), is out. The lesson is redone many times, and the most competent player becomes THE PERFECT CIRNO.&#10;&#10;When you are out, you get a &quot;friend&quot; card. The friend cards can be used to change hands, make Cirno be able to count to 20 and so on. Perhaps they can help you turn the tables?&#10;&#10;With simple rules and a quick tempo, this is a card game with the power enough to improve your brain somewhat, playable for all people, from those already married to Cirno, to those who barely know what project Shrine Maiden is.&#10;&#10;For 2-6 players&#10;Playtime: 5-15 minutes&#10;Recommended age: Older than a fairy&#10;&#10;"

For playing you use two dice for deciding an attack. Throwing one dice you decide if you go below the basket, or the player may run after one pass into the fast attack. Also you have many chances to get the long distance throw. For very lucky shots you can earn extra free throws as well. Using these two dice you decide the success of the free throws and fast attacks. Attack cards can be used to avoid ball loss and the get more chances to get a score.&#10;&#10;For the game play changing the players have attack and defense cards. Defense cards help to defend against opponent attacks and force the ball lost. Attack cards can be used to avid ball loss and the get more changes to get a score.&#10;&#10;Like in real life, when one teams dominates over another, it can happen here as well. You can get the rush after the right moment and can gain a lot of points in a short while. So you should always play until the end of the game, because things may change fast.&#10;&#10;"

Each player gets three moves in sequence, which can be a combination of moving a pawn one space, passing the puck from one pawn to another along any clear line, and of course shooting on goal. Passes must not violate standard offside rules.&#10;&#10;Any given pawn can only move two spaces in a turn, but the board includes &quot;slide&quot; lines that allow bursts of speed on offence or defence. One player takes the puck away from the other by moving a pawn onto the same space as the puck carrier (the pawns have a peg to hold them on top of the puck), &quot;checking&quot; his opponent into an adjacent circle.&#10;&#10;Most challenging of all for all players: a penalty is called when either team fails to complete its three-element move within 15 seconds! Going over the limit means you lose one of your pawns for the next three turns.&#10;&#10;While intended to be played for fun, it includes a significant teaching component, including dotted lines on the board showing the areas of responsibility for different positions, and a set of 18 Hockey Tips listed inside the box.&#10;&#10;"
