Cards range from an Ace up to the dreaded Snowman (an 8). Play nine holes or eighteen, it's up to you. Whether you're a scratch golfer, a hacker or have never picked up a golf club you'll love Shiperio. Just like on the course players will succeed with skill, strategy, and a little luck!&#10;&#10;In golf, the term Shiperio is similar to a Mulligan where a player is allowed a second shot without penalty. The nice thing about a Shiperio is that, unlike a Mulligan, the golfer gets to choose which ball to play. In our game we have a card called the Shiperio Card . It's played quite similar to a Shiperio on the course. We liked the name so much we decided to name the game after it.&#10;&#10;"

To do so, they must collect keys that open doors, gear that will help them on the way - for example, a rope will allow a player to use routes otherwise not accessible, a shield will protect them in combat, etc. - and face various dangers and creatures, many of which can be defeated with the correct gear. And, since this is cutthroat rather than co-op, they can of course battle each other too for the possession of keys or maiden chits - the real maiden will be in one of the six maiden chits randomly distributed in the castle's six towers, and the one who manages to bring her safely back to square one will be the winner. Good luck and - &quot;Courage and strength!&quot;&#10;&#10;Note: There is a typo in this game's contents list.

Elements of the game are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A large number of marbles in solid colors including red, blue, yellow, green and purple.&#10;     A yellow plastic &quot;mountain&quot; in a volcano shape with a small rim at the bottom to catch fallen marbles.&#10;     A matching plastic cone that marbles are poured into and that the mountain is then fitted into.  The combination is inverted so that the mountain then rests on its base and the plastic cone is carefully lifted off, leaving the mountain evenly covered with a variety of solid colored marbles.&#10;     A set (I think there were 6 of these but am not positive; it might have been 4) of black cardboard playing fields cut into the profile of a mountain.  Approximately a dozen circular depressions are cut into each playing field, and these have a random distribution of colors matching the marble colors painted on them.&#10;     Several sets of oversized, blue plastic tweezers with blunt tips.&#10;&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the player who fills the most circles on his playing field by picking the appropriate color marbles off of the plastic mountain with the tweezers and setting them into the matching circles on his board, without causing an avalanche of marbles to cascade down the sides of the plastic mountain, and also without knocking any marbles out of their depressions on his playing field.  The first child to cause an avalanche or knock over her marbles loses.  In the event that none of the players create an avalanche or knock off marbles, then the first player to fill up all of the circles on her board wins.&#10;&#10;Players must start at the base of their own mountain playing field and fill in the entire bottom row with marbles before ascending to the next row up.  Since each playing field has a unique distribution of colors, players will need different colors of marbles at different points in the game.  This means a layer of strategy can be added by trying to remove not only the color of marble you need next, but by selecting a specific marble of that color from the marble mountain that leaves your opponent with more difficult and avalanche-prone choices.&#10;&#10;"

Also included are two plastic trays containing an assortment of letters in two colors, in my edition (blue on white / white on blue and red on white / white on red).  German umlauted versions of A,O and U are also included.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly composes a word of up to 10 letters in their home rack on the stationery part of the board, then transposes the word into the upper rack of the yellow turntable.  The turntable is then rotated and each player races to place their other colored letters in the middle rack to try to solve the anagram.  The first player to solve the anagram presses their red button and presents their answer to their opponent.  If correct they win if wrong they lose.  The winning player claims the tiles used by the loser at the end of each round.  Play continues until a player is unable to solve a word with their available letter tiles.&#10;&#10;A good educational game designed to expand your child's vocabulary and improve their mental agility with a tiny amount of strategy in word selection.&#10;&#10;The only flaw with the game is the overly enthusiastic rubber band powered mechanism, which when activated, scatters both sets of tiles.&#10;&#10;"

You may also stop turning cards over and decide to keep what you've got so far. There are also bugs helping players and chickens giving aid for collecting an extra amount of cards.&#10;&#10;"

The cards (total 96) refer to that segments (to where the ball is played) and the opponent has to be with his 'player' (figure) in an adjacent segment to hit the ball. During play, the figure is able to move 1 segment before the action card is played. Some cards are marked as 'stop-ball' or 'Net-roller', that means, the player has to reach the named segment to be able to hit the ball. &#10;Tennmac is a strategic tennis simulation.&#10;&#10;"
