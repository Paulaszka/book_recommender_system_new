The objective is to connect five (or more) of one's tiles, including at least one of each type, together (sides and corners count).  Additionally, all five (or more) tiles must be face-up, or unactivated.  The game ends immediately when a player achieves this goal.  Each character type has a specific ability to help you toward the objective.&#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayPlayers take turns using either 1 or 2 actions within 5 action rounds.  Once one player's actions are consumed for a round, the other player(s) get to use any of their remaining 5 actions at once.  Judicious action management is key; if one budgets one's actions wisely, one can play several actions in a row for game-winning combinations.  The available actions are as follows:&#10;&#10;&#10;      Add a tile to the Grid&#10;      Move one of one's tiles&#10;      Refresh or flip a tile face up&#10;      Shove a tile or column/row of tiles&#10;      Activate an ability (the chosen tile turns face down; see below)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Characters &amp; abilities&#10;    Alien &mdash; The Alien uses her tractor beam to pull any tile in the Grid to a space that is adjacent to her. &#10;    Monkey &mdash; The mischievous Monkey uses a banana peel to flip over all of the tiles it is touching. &#10;    Ninja &mdash; The sneaky Ninja can move from his current spot to any other unoccupied space in the Grid.&#10;    Pirate &mdash; The Pirate uses his trusty cannon to blast an adjacent tile to any unoccupied space in the Grid.&#10;    Zombie &mdash; The Zombie can infect any adjacent tile. The infected tile is removed from the Grid and replaced with a Zombie tile that has not yet been added to the Grid. If all of the Zombie tiles have already been added to the Grid, the Zombie may choose one adjacent tile and deactivate it (that is, flip it face down).&#10;&#10;&#10;"

When US forces occupied Manila, Aguanildo's own larger, and initially better armed veteran force squared off with McKinley's expeditionary force. There followed four years of &quot;official hostilities&quot; (Guerrilla activities dragged on for more than a decade after McKinley declared end to the war). Hostilities raged across the central island of Luzon and several other major island. After Aguinaldo's capture, his regular forces melted into the bush and US troops faced its first major guerrilla war in the Pacific. As with later foreign adventures, it was not a popular war at home.&#10;&#10;Amigos and Insurrectos is an area movement game for two players (a US and a Filipino player). Three scenarios will be offered: an eight turn - STAND UP FIGHT, represents the clash of regular forces; an eight turn - INTO THE BUSH, representing the guerrilla phase of the conflict, and a 15 turn CAMPAIGN GAME, combining both. Regular forces will be represented on the regimental level. Abstract jungle movement will be available through guerrilla movement boxes and movement between islands will be possible though trans-island boxes. Originally designed as a Card-Driven game, random historical events will occur based on objective and turn based triggers. Victory will be based on a point swing track that in the extreme, could see Filipino collapse or US withdrawal. This is a topic shown very little attention in the gaming hobby. Luckily, Olivier has seen fit to feature it in the upcoming issue #11 of BATTLES MAGAZINE.&#10;&#10;"

Players take on either the role of the United States, struggling to protect itself from foreign threat, or the role of one or more of the invading armies, fighting battle after battle to acquire important territories.&#10;&#10;If the invading forces claim enough U.S. cities, America's defense is broken and the nation falls. But if the United States can protect its cities for long enough, the invading forces fail to uproot America and their incursion is ended.&#10;&#10;Fortress America is played over several rounds in which each player musters his forces, moves into enemy-controlled territories, and engages in fierce firefights. But depending on whether you're the U.S. player or one of the Invaders, your play experience and general strategy will be entirely different. The U.S. must efficiently wield its colossal lasers, the ultimate weapons of mass destruction, in its own defense. What's more, as U.S. hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, and infantry are destroyed and removed from the map, a steady supply of American guerilla fighters spring up to defend their homeland. The U.S. player is surrounded and alone, and must do his best to fend off advances on three fronts in a series of tense battles.&#10;&#10;The Invaders, on the other hand, must remain constantly aggressive. Their objective is to collectively capture 18 of 30 major U.S. cities, and to do so, they must apply early pressure before the U.S. has a chance to react, and keep the pressure constant. To complicate the Invaders' mission, their armies do not receive additional reinforcements, so they must make optimal use of the forces at their disposal. Through a series of nail-biting battles that use a unique dice-based combat system, each player will maneuver his dwindling armies to secure his objective. But can America be stopped, or will a failed invasion only compel them to tighten their military grip on the world.&#10;&#10;Changed in this edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Custom combat dice, debatable if better than normal dice.&#10;     A ten-turn timer gives the U.S. player an additional path to victory: outlasting the invasion.&#10;     A &quot;Captured City&quot; track lets all players see, at a quick glance, how close they are to victory or defeat.&#10;     A few city locations have been removed, and others added, to create a different (possibly more balanced) play experience.&#10;     A deck of variant cards for the Invader players has been added to use as a rules option (equal to 1-2 balance levels).&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;    Fortress America (1986)&#10;&#10;&#10;"
