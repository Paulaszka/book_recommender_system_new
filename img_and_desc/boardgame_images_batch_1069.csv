In each kingdom, you engage in a series of debates with their ruler. Using the right amount of force and deference, you must win exactly a certain number of debates per kingdom. Succeed and you may call upon the ruler for future support; fail even once and lose the game.&#10;&#10;The Emissary is a solo trick-taking game playable with a deck of regular playing cards, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series. The game begins by arranging the deck's eight kings and queens in a row. The player then &quot;visits&quot; each card, in whatever order they choose, drawing a new hand of eight cards from the remainder of deck at each stop. They then draw cards one at a time from the deck, forming the basis of tricks, which the player answers from their own hand. The catch is that whatever place the king or queen being &quot;visited&quot; by the player is (e.g., 1st place through 8th place), that's how many tricks must be won by the player -- no more, and no less. With only a limited capacity to bend the rules through special abilities, the game becomes an exercise in careful hand manipulation and excruciating trade-offs.&#10;&#10;The game is inspired by the decktet game Gongor Whist, which itself was patterned from the standard-deck card game Oneonta Whist. This game also holds the core for the free print-and-play game For Northwood!, which swept top prizes in the 2021 BGG 54-card contest. Familiarity with trick-taking games will make understanding the following rules a breeze. Of course, prior knowledge isn't strictly necessary.&#10;&#10;"

Over three passes through the deck, you will be drafting stacks of cards from a random market, which you&rsquo;ll place into a 3x3 grid. However, each grid cell may only be stacked three cards high - any more and the bottom cards get discarded. Your aim is to create a path of at least 5 increasing cards for each of the four suits.&#10;&#10;Skyway is a solo pattern-building game playable with a deck of regular playing cards, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series. On each turn, the player deals stacks of cards to a market, and then chooses one stack to build inside a 3x3 grid. Over three passes through the deck, the player tries to construct the grid in such a way as to create a five-card sequence in each suit -- a pathway formed by the cards that can snake around or intersect with the other suits' pathways. The catch is that each square on the grid can only hold a stack of cards three high, and placing the one card needed to complete one pathway may very well cause a card crucial to another pathway to be discarded.&#10;&#10;Arranging tiles to create maps is a cornerstone of many great city-building games like Suburbia and Sprawlopolis. However, most games of this genre require more information on each card than a simple rank-and-suit system can provide. Skyway takes its cue from the Decktet game Aucteraden. By allowing a single space to have more than one &ldquo;suit&rdquo; on it, the paths can intersect and weave around each other to create a small, tight puzzle.&#10;&#10;As part of the Isaludo collection, the rules can be found in this forum thread.&#10;&#10;"

For that, a pawn and a dice are used giving you the option to select the type of questions that you are most familiar with. One side of the card is showing a scene from the movie, while the other has the title, director and actors/actresses involved.&#10;&#10;When a movie card is played, the player/team has to answer the question to win it. If he/she/they can't reply then the next player has the opportunity to do so, etc. A movie card never returns to the pile.&#10;&#10;The goal is to collect as many movie cards as possible throughout the game.

The recommended board sizes are between 3 and 12 cells per side.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by Michael Amundsen and Luis Bola&ntilde;os Mures. Although inspired by Go, it bears a significant resemblance to Kanare Kato's Meridians.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is an entire set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.&#10;&#10;A group is dead if there is no path of connected empty cells between that group and any other group of its color. The path does not need to be a straight line.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform the following actions in order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If it is your first turn of the game, perform this action twice.&#10;     Remove all dead enemy groups.&#10;     Remove all dead friendly groups.&#10;&#10;&#10;The board positions at the start and at the end of your turn must be different. In other words, if the only stone you remove is the one you just placed, your placement is illegal.&#10;&#10;The last player to make a placement wins. Note that, after your first turn, you will always have a placement available unless you have no groups on the board.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsThe standard game is made fair by the combination of the double first move and White's swap option, as described above. This balancing method is called strong pie. Some alternatives are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Weak pie: Instead of placing twice on their first turn, players place one stone on every turn, and dead groups are not removed until there are at least four stones on the board. White's swap option still applies, but takes place after Black has placed only one stone.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Komi pie: Before the game starts, the first player chooses a whole number as the komi value, and then the second player chooses sides. The first four stones are placed in the same manner as with weak pie, but there is no swap option after Black's fist placement. Throughout the game proper, White will have the option to spend a point of komi instead of making a placement.&#10;&#10;&#10;Unlike strong pie, these methods require somewhat large boards to be effective: at least base 6 for weak pie, and at least base 7 for komi pie.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designers&#10;&#10;"
