Advanced players may add other objects, like dry moss, other animals, or stranger things.&#10;&#10;Each player projects themselves into the game board in a spot. He imagines himself in that position at a certain facing. The object is to report his position on the board.&#10;&#10;He does not speak but instead draws a sketch of what he sees on the notepad. The sketch is marked with his name.&#10;&#10;The sketches are all then turned up. Each player takes the little maps of the game board and locates each player on the map. Also draw an arrow to indicate the facing.&#10;&#10;Speed is good. The first player to slap his guess face down gets bonus points.&#10;&#10;"

The bigger the amount of cards with the same symbol the player has, the more money is gained.&#10;&#10;The twist: movement is done by selecting chit, checking the back for a number, and moving however far you want to move, without revealing the actual number to the opponents. The opponents then have to accept your move or challenge the number on your chit.&#10;&#10;If they challenge the number, the player may either confess to cheating and pay a nominal fine or start a poker like bidding system in which the challenger must match his bid before he can see the chit.&#10;&#10;"

One player plays the Fellowship, deploying Heroes in an attempt to misdirect and deceive the other player, who plays Sauron with control of the evil Nazg&ucirc;l and Balrog. It takes many of the ideas from the character game of SPI&rsquo;s War of the Ring and expands upon them.&#10;&#10;"

1191,,"Each player is dealt a Hidden Card to begin.  The object is to accumulate points by deducing the opponents' Hidden Card as quickly as possible.  Next, each player is dealt an equal portion of the remaining deck, and must give information to the opponents; s/he must lay down a card of Higher Value, Lower Value, Different Value, and Different Suit.  Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.  After everyone has revealed their card, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

1193,,"The idea of The Bottom Line is to accumulate $5,000,000 and land on the Bank, so as to buy it.  Not as easy as it sounds.  You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comes when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.  A good finance game, but it was only printed for a year in America. Copies do pop up on eBay (where I got mine).&#10;&#10;"

Colors, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, purple and red; oval, diamond and squiggle; and solid, shaded and outlined.&#10;&#10;All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. For example, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but three different shapes, shadings, and colors, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.&#10;&#10;To play, one person takes the deck and lays out twelve cards face up. The first person to spot a set collects those three cards; if the player was mistaken, then this player cannot claim a set until after another player has done so. After someone has claimed a set, the cardholder lays out three more cards. (If all players agree that no sets can be claimed, then the cardholder lays out three more cards. These cards aren't replaced after someone claims a set.) Whoever claims the most sets wins!&#10;&#10;"

Each one has a tongue-twister, riddle, logic question, or tough knowledge bit on it.  If they're wrong, discard the question, and the next person goes.  If they are right, he or she gives you a card and you discard the played one.&#10;&#10;Black Hole cards are the comedy part of the game: when you land on one, have a person read it to you and do whatever the outcome is, after everyone is finished laughing.&#10;&#10;So it's a race to get rid of cards and get to the middle.

The top company of each stack is vulnerable to proxy take-overs by other players, so they usually attempt to order their holdings such that the most valuable ones are covered by less valuable companies.

It is intended for players who don&rsquo;t mind taking a few hours to play a game but who like a strong dose of the beer and pretzels factor, even if it means their painstakingly enacted strategic schemes are occasionally foiled by a player who manages to win the Mythos 500.&#10;&#10;The Strategic Game&#10;This is similar to the Standard Game, but removes some of really weird stuff. It allows more conventional board gamers to concentrate on sane strategies and not get too disturbed by wandering madness.&#10;&#10;The Bloodbath Scenario&#10;This is Cults Across America on steroids, and can be played in as little as an hour. The rule set is reduced somewhat so players don&rsquo;t have to get all concerned about resource management and other fiddly details. The victory conditions are simple too: you win by stomping the hell out of anything that&rsquo;s not on your side. Last man (or whatever) standing takes the day.&#10;&#10;Cults Across America has a Cthulhu Mythos theme.&#10;&#10;"

Each turn, the active player takes the free labyrinth tile and pushes it along one of the rows or columns marked with an arrow on the game board. This action inserts that tile into the labyrinth and pushes the other tiles one space, popping one tile out of the labyrinth to be used by the next player on her turn. By shifting the walls, the player hopes to be able to move his token along the paths to land on the treasure currently being sought. If the player does this, he claims the treasure card and a new card is revealed; if not, play continues until someone grabs that treasure.&#10;&#10;Once all the treasure has been collected, the game ends and whoever nabbed the most treasure wins!&#10;&#10;"

The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;"

Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.&#10;&#10;The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.&#10;&#10;Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.

Each card is unique because in addition to the cop, they each have a diffrent symbol on them, i.e. a Tree, a Stop Sign, etc. Now put them in a circle with their feet toward the inside of the circle. Further, you also have a deck of 21 Direction cards and each has a symbol (which corresponds to the ones on the Traffic Cop cards) and 3 directions on them, i.e. A Tree, 4 Rights, 3 Lefts, 2 Lefts. This Direction deck is placed face down in the center of the circle. Anyone flips a direction card and it all starts; start at the Traffic Cop that has the matching symbol, then move left and right as the card calls for, but remember you must move to the Traffic Cop's left or right. So depending on if they are facing forward or backwards, you go the appropriate direction. Whoever calls out the correct stopping place first, by symbol, wins the card. Good game similar to Ikarus.&#10;&#10;"

The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.&#10;&#10;The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.&#10;&#10;Add in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing.

Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.
