We are in the 1980s, an era that you probably experienced directly or indirectly through films, music, board games, videogames and everything that that unique and unrepeatable decade has left thanks to the echo of a time near and far. Did you know that the 80s were full of monsters and creatures of all kinds? If your answer is no, you probably did not directly experience that era or you have been told that it was just rumors; but if you lived it, if you were a child or a kid during those years, you know what I'm talking about. Monsters existed and walked around on their own legs. Of course, adults would never have believed you, but I can guarantee you that at that time Evil had eyes and legs, mouths and teeth.&#10;&#10;The peculiarity of Stranger Tales is that you will have everything ready in one box: Just take it with you to experience fantastic adventures and you won't need anything else! Everything is in the box. Stranger Tales is also a mammoth work on &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s Pop Culture. In fact, in the definitive manual, you will find not only the rules to play but also contents that will help you identify yourself again&mdash;or for the first time&mdash;in a world so near and far.&#10;&#10;The Fusion System that was born in Tales of Evil and continued in Boogeyman here evolves to the highest levels. It will only be your imagination and what you find in the stories that set the limits; but in reality, there is no limit whatsoever. You will be able to integrate into the game any action or behavior you wish in order to help your Investigators during your adventure. You may even be able to foresee that some Tests could take place outside of the usual game session, such as challenging players with special tasks to complete &ldquo;side quests&rdquo; in their real life.  For example, nothing prevents you from requesting a certain type of flower or object be brought the next time you get together to play, or performing real actions such as going to a place and hiding something there and then asking the other players to find the object that you have hidden before your next game session. As you can see, the limits to what you can create with the Fusion System are practically infinite. Don't like the Fusion System? Don't love taking actions in your real life to directly influence the game? No problem. In agreement with the other players, you can safely decide not to use the Fusion System for your games. The beauty of Stranger Tales is precisely this&mdash;that is to say, being able to adapt the game to your liking and in your image and likeness.

This was the era where Indonesian young women were stepping up to the plate, leading battles and participating in politics for a free Indonesia. Realizing that the key to the nation&rsquo;s eventual liberation lied in education, some of them built schools and advocated for more and more girls to be educated to then participate in the nation&rsquo;s fight for freedom. Indonesian women&rsquo;s yearning for education and to take an active role in the public life were encapsulated in a famous series of letters written by Kartini, a Javanese aristocrat, to her Dutch friends. These letters were later published as a book titled &lsquo;From Darkness to Light&rsquo; from which the name of this game derived. Kartini&rsquo;s letters are often credited as one of the cornerstones of Indonesian women emancipation movement and they served as profound inspirations for Indonesia&rsquo;s fight for independence.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Additionally,  there is also a 'Curriculum Guide' available:&#10;&#10;"

The outcome of this engagement was crucial for both the Argentinians and the British: The Argentinians needed to prove themselves against the professional British war machine, while the British needed a land victory to satisfy the government and the public after recently suffering naval losses. Originally intended as a raid, the clash became a full 14-hour battle resulting in a hard-fought British victory.&#10;&#10;Goose Green covers this entire battle in turns representing 20-30 minutes each, and a map scale of 125 yards per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. Both sides fielded what was roughly a reinforced Battalion, making for a battle that made for a quick playing game with great replay value. With just a minimum of special rules, this game brings the TCS to the 1980s, where in a classic infantry confrontation, not a lot has changed since WWII.&#10;&#10;The British player must orchestrate a fast-paced attack crossing the entire map, removing all points of Argentinian resistance, and capturing Goose Green with a minimum of losses. He must make good use of few supporting arms available (half a battery of artillery, MILAN ATGMs and light mortar and MG support) to overcome dug-in Argentinian forces that outnumber the British by 2:1.&#10;&#10;The Argentinian player has solid troops with reasonable artillery and air support but must create a defense in depth against a better lead British force accustomed to a higher operational tempo and greater firepower. Every turn requires important decisions of when to hold the line, when to withdraw, and where to commit the few remaining reserves to delay and possibly stop the British attack.&#10;&#10;The Argentinians do not have the motivation and training level of the British but are dug-in with the benefit of minefields, trenches, numerous heavy weapons, and AA guns to assist the defense.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;The Battle of Goose Green (historical deployment, 39 turns)&#10;Burntside House and Low Pass (5 turns)&#10;Darwin Hill (15 turns)&#10;The Airfield and the Schoolhouse (14 turns)&#10;Bloody Goose Green (full battle with better Argentine deployment, 40 turns)&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;TCS rulebook (version 4.01)&#10;Goose Green game-specific rulebook&#10;2 x TCS Charts &amp; Tables&#10;One Full Color Game Map (22&quot;x34&quot;)&#10;140 Counters&#10;Zip Lock Bag&#10;&#10;-description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
