In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.&#10;&#10;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.&#10;&#10;The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.&#10;&#10;The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.&#10;&#10;"

It's Pick Stick Oh!&#10;&#10;Pick Stick Oh! is a new twist on the classic Pick Up Sticks, played with cards rather than sticks.  Players are dealt cards and then take turns tossing them into a pile.

Cards have point values from 1 to 5.  If a player takes a red 2 or 3 successfully, he or she gets another turn.  The player with the most total points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand.  Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars; Amazons on large mutated beasts; a third clan of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths; and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie's just recently and there weren't no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. &quot;Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside.&quot; The air is more dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It's a good sight to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I'm thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It's God's will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I'm hoping we can start again. Me, I'm hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Last Stand was known as Stanfield before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it's where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don't know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation &ndash; mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be,  unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We'll use it carefully.  The Last Stand may be our last hope.

Using the force from the stars, channeled through the star altar, the residents could control time and transform the versatile resource &quot;materia&quot; into anything they wished. You are one of the city builders of Lemuria, and you must fight for control of the altar, sometimes cooperating with others and using your resources to further develop the ancient city &mdash; and you have only one year in which to do it.&#10;&#10;Lemuria &mdash; originally released as &#230;&#152;&#159;&#229;&#136;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;, or &quot;The Star Kingdom Lemuria&quot; &mdash; is at its heart a worker placement, resource management, and area control game. Players try to get points chiefly by converting two types of workers into resources, then using those resources to buy buildings. Points can also be gained by using special cards and by combining them with buildings.&#10;&#10;The game simulates one full year in Lemuria's lifespan, with each of the twelve rounds representing one month, and with harvests on rounds 4, 8, and 12. On their turn, a player must either (1) place workers to &quot;seed&quot; their materia, or (2) harvest resources as a result of prior placements. Players may also choose to use accumulated resources to buy buildings, use accumulated food to &quot;employ citizens&quot; (use special cards), or spend gold to perform extra actions. Citizens can reside in buildings, which gives extra points during the harvests.&#10;&#10;"

But now, the manor has been reopened and turned into a hotel for the living. You play the part of one of Spookie&rsquo;s ghostly minions, charged with ridding the house of these warm-bodied usurpers. Use your skills of terror to send them fleeing into the night and win Spookie&rsquo;s patronage. Who will be top ghost?&#10;&#10;Ghostel is a semi-cooperative family game where players prey on the phobias of guests by turning into their worst nightmares. Work with other ghosts to combine forces, and scare away the hardiest of hotel patrons to earn upgrades and get even scarier!&#10;&#10;The game of Ghostel is made of rounds, and each round is split into a Day Phase and a Night Phase. The randomised guest and dice roll mechanic means each round is different from the next, but there&rsquo;s more than luck to winning the game.&#10;&#10;During the day, new people will enter the hotel whilst those who already spent the night and survived will calm down from their twilight visitations. Meanwhile, the ghosts are hiding in the attic, preparing for the next night by buying more Terror Dice, Scare Tactics to improve their scaring and Spookie favours to give those extra little bonuses.&#10;&#10;During the night, the ghosts walk the rooms, using all their creepy tactics to frighten the humans away and show off for Spookie himself. At the start of the night Phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that night. Players can move one room per turn, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total of all dice in a room exceeds the courage of the human in residence of that room, they're scared out of the hotel! Players then score based on who placed the highest scoring dice; however, scoring is graduated so even a single pip die will still score the canny player some victory points.&#10;&#10;"

Aim to misbehave.&#10;&#10;Firefly: Fistful of Credits is a two-to-four-player cooperative game where players step into the boots of Serenity&rsquo;s crew to pull off a series of dangerous heists and hopefully walk away with their lives and a tidy fortune! The game features three distinct heist scenarios inspired by the episodes Bushwhacked, The Train Job, and Ariel; each with their own highly-detailed board, tokens, and Heist card, which details unique objectives from the show that must be accomplished in order to win.&#10;&#10;Players pair up any two of the nine crew members, forming unique teams that work with other players to collect gear, fight, and face both luck and misfortune while racing against the clock to complete the heist. Be careful: triggering an alarm, lollygagging around or sticking your nose in the wrong crate can open up a whole world of ugly - be it Reavers, Alliance, or the sinister Hands of Blue!&#10;&#10;Fail and it&rsquo;s all over... but succeeding means you and your crew walk away with more than a fistful of credits!&#10;&#10;"
