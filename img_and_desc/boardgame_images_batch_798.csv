In Movie Empire, you are a junior producer working for that guy and are competing with other players to be the heir to his throne. You do this by producing movies (a few big blockbusters or several small trash movies) and publish them at the right time in the right market and hit trends to get awards. But also keep an eye on pleasing your boss as this will have an influence on your assets.&#10;&#10;Movie Empire is a mix of worker placement and set collection for 1-4 players. And as Hollywood is a shark tank, you have the (completely optional!) black dossier variant, that adds a take that mechanism to the gameplay. Let the clubbing and stabbing commence!&#10;&#10;The game consists of four phases: Grumpy phase, working phase, premiere phase and upkeep phase.&#10;&#10;The most important phase is the working phase. This is where you send out your production assistants (a.k.a. workers) in order to get production assets, cast stars, buy scripts or do some other tasks. But since many tasks can only be occupied by one player, you have to choose your strategy carefully. The gathered resources have to be attached to a movie. Pay attention to special laying rules and requirements - for example, post-production has to happen after shooting the movie and not before.&#10;&#10;Then if you feel like it, prepare for releasing your movie. Choose a market (each one with its own advantage) and reap your rewards. If you release the right movie at the right time, get ready for an award. But don't forget your boss, Mr. Grumpy. The more he likes you, the more possibilities you have. The sympathy value defines your budget every round and can open a second production line for you.&#10;&#10;So, who's gonna be the best producer in town?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Rabbit Trails is card game for all ages (especially students!) involving play with word association.&#10;&#10;How do you play it? Play starts with each player being dealt 7 cards. Then the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over. Each player takes turns laying a card this is easily associated with the card showing. For example: The card flipped at the start of the game is, &quot;Rabbit&quot;. Player 1 plays, &quot;Carrot&quot; (because rabbits eat carrots). Player 2 plays, &quot;Chef&quot; (because chefs can cook carrots). Player 3 plays, &quot;Astronaut&quot; (because both chef and astronaut are professions). And player 4 plays, &quot;Grape&quot;. Wait! Grape?? Grape clearly doesn't match with &quot;Astronaut&quot;. The other players hear out Player 4's reasoning and vote on whether or not to allow the card to stay in play. They vote for the card to be removed. Player 4 has to draw a new card as a penalty and play continues. The winner is the first person to get rid of all their cards. If a player cannot play (and does not want to try and fool the others by playing a less than perfect card), the player can draw and, if the card will work, play it right away.&#10;&#10;But that's not all! There are also action cards featuring various ways to foil the plans of the other players and get you closer to winning the game.&#10;&#10;What are the benefits of Rabbit Trails? Benefit #1, Rabbit Trails is an awesome game. Seriously! I have been designing this game over the past couple of years and have been getting bogged down with requests to make this game available from friends, family, and even people who see us playing it while out around town. After refining the cards and getting the rules nailed down, this game is finally ready for prime time! But that isn't all... Benefit #2, is related to education. It's not often that fun and education go together, but Rabbit Trails bridges that gap. Because the aim of the game is to get players to find connections between words, it makes students use higher order thinking, like analysis and evaluation to be successful, which are at the top of Bloom's taxonomy.Benefit #3 [Bonus], Rabbit Trails is great to test your English language skills if you are currently learning English or use English as a second language. It makes English language learners think critically about words and their multiple meanings!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

With dozens of outposts scattered across the surface, a new challenge awaits: providing infrastructure to the red planet and moving goods to where they are needed most (while making a tidy profit of course). Fortunately the abundance of precious metals will help with this task by allowing upgrades to the transport vessels over time.&#10;&#10;Tracks on Mars is a light-weight family crayon rail game. It has been designed specifically for two players. Drawing the tracks, loading goods onto the pawns, and over sized dice all work together to make this a very tactile experience. Luck is a major factor but can be mitigated by re-rolls and catch-up mechanics. On a strategic level, players have to balance network building, transportation, and equipment upgrades.&#10;&#10;The core mechanics are Yahtzee-style dice rolling and resource allocation. Matching dice rolls are converted to currency which is then used to either claim new routes or move the player's pawns to pick up and deliver goods. Victory points are ultimately  scored depending on the distance that goods have been transported. Players have to decide whether they want to make multiple short runs for few VPs or spend turns building a long route for fewer high value transports.&#10;&#10;This is a print &amp; play title comprised of five dice, 40 resource cubes, currency token cards, an 18&quot; x 18&quot; board, and four 3D printed pawns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming British Bombers. Nightfighter Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Hunters game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German Nightfighter pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other nightfighter bases in an attempt to get &quot;closer to the action&quot; or request a newer type of nightfighter. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player's eventual goal &ndash; to become the top nightfighter ace of the war.&#10;&#10;The system is packed with rich technical detail but without the complexity to capture the key historical facets of the night bombing campaign over Germany. In terms of nightfighters alone, there are 32 nightfighter models available to pilot. The families of nightfighters include:&#10;&#10;        Bf110 (10 aircraft)&#10;        Ju88 (5 aircraft)&#10;        Do 215/217 (6 aircraft)&#10;        He219 (10 aircraft)&#10;        Ta154 (1 aircraft)&#10;&#10;&#10;For each nightfighter, you will be tracking the date of availability, speed, area of operations based on originating base, individual weapon systems, electronic systems, damage, and crew status.&#10;&#10;Nightfighters can be assigned to one of seven possible major geographic base &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as follows:&#10;&#10;        Dutch: Melsbroek, Schipol, Deelen, St. Trond, Twenthe, Leeuwarden, Venlo, Gilze-Rijen&#10;        Bremen: Vechta, Schleswig-Holstein, Stade, Grove&#10;        French: Florennes, Dijon, Juvincourt&#10;        Berlin: Stendal, Parchim, Werneuchen&#10;        Munich: Schleissheim, Neubiberg&#10;        M&#197;&#177;nster: M&#197;&#177;nster&#10;        Frankfurt: Mainz, Rhein-Main&#10;&#10;&#10;Besides the focus on hardware, the soft aspects of the war are also faithfully rendered for each pilot and crew. For example, air crew is characterized by various major and minor skills, including numerous Pilot skills, Funker (Radio Operator) skills, Bordmech. (Flight Engineer) skills, Bordschuetze (Rear Gunner) skills, and Prestige Level. The emphasis on various skills and benefits to gaining experience creates even a stronger narrative when compared to the Hunters game system, which helps weave a tense and dramatic narrative during play. One major change in Nightfighter Ace over Hunters is the ability to choose your crew improvements instead of randomly rolling for them. As these greatly impact on your combat capability (and survival), it is a major decision you must make.&#10;&#10;Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot and crew along with your nightfighter assignment, play proceeds by checking for incoming raid information while checking for weather prior to take off (as the sortie may be cancelled). One must also check for random electronic failure. Following successful take off, play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the British bombers. One is not immune to Spoof raids, in which case German ground control is deceived, causing you to burn precious time and fuel flying the wrong direction. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a new nightfighter, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until July 1944 should you make it through unscathed.&#10;&#10;This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters or Silent Victory designed by Gregory M. Smith (published by Consim Press). The game system lends itself very well to capturing the tense air defense over Germany. While Nightfighter Ace is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions.&#10; Product Information:&#10;&#10;        Complexity: 6 out of 10&#10;        Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10&#10;        Time Scale: 3-4 days per Turn&#10;        Map Scale: Abstract&#10;        Unit Scale: individual aircraft, individual weapon systems, individual electronic systems, specific crew members, and ammo rounds&#10;        Players: one (with option for two or more)&#10;        Playing Time: two to three hours&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;Components:&#10;&#10;        One Countersheet of 9/16&Prime; unit-counters&#10;        Sixteen Aircraft Display Mats 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime; (double-sided, 32 total)&#10;        Four Player Aid Cards 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Combat Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Bomber Target Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Pilot Awards Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;&#10;        One Air Operations Display Mat 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo;&#10;        Forty Ace Pilot Cards&#10;        Sixty Combat Cards&#10;        Rules Booklet featuring extensive Historical Background&#10;        One Logsheet 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;&#10;        Two 6-sided and one 10-sided die&#10;        Box and Lid&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

One deck represents a happy baby, another a sad baby, and the middle a neutral baby. A baby status token moves between the decks, indicating the current climate of the infant and also defining from which deck the next card should be drawn. Cards are only seen by the player playing the role of the child, and upon them are depicted up to two different needs of the five in the game: hungry, poopie, sleepy, restless and crying wolf (ie. nothing's really wrong). Depending on the card the player will then place face-down tokens showing the baby is upset but not visibly indicating what the cause is. These needs can be resolved with different parent tokens, such as feeding, diapers, carrying, music and playing. While the need tokens don't come in multiples and therefore can't &quot;double up&quot; on the same time the parents only have a limited number of each of their tokens so they must use them wisely. After each step of the game (child expressing and then parents attempting to solve it) the baby status is always move to indicate the new state of the child. If a card should be drawn from an empty deck, the game has ended and the players all win if the status of the baby is happy.&#10;&#10;"

The musket was refined into a flintlock, smoothbore with a socket bayonet. Although accuracy was low, which limited effective fire to very short ranges, volume of fire improved considerably and units were capable of firing three and sometimes four rounds a minute. The infantryman was now capable of combining the roles of musketeer and pikeman in one. And to maximise firepower, formations became wider. The aim was to move a formation to within range of the enemy and then overwhelm them with firepower.

The game depicts the struggles of the Kim Regime from 1953 to present day North Korea against the West.&#10;&#10;In the aftermath of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean peninsula divided in two. While its signature marked a cessation of armed conflict, the war was not over. In over six decades since the armistice was signed, three generations of the Kim regime resisted Chinese and Soviet influence, endured floods, famine, isolation and economic sanctions while defiantly pursuing nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;One player will be the DPRK (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea), seeking a nuclear deterrent to invasion, improving living standards to prevent uprising, and purging elites to prevent a coup.&#10;&#10;Another player will be the West, aiding defectors to obtain intel, stymieing the missile program to secure the region, implementing sanctions to impede the North Korean economy and further isolating the DPRK from the global community to intensify pressure on the regime.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Ships begin docked at their stations and are then deployed to sectors as new ships are commissioned under your command. Use cargo vessels to engage in trade and commerce; mining vessels to build reoccurring base income; and carriers to spread your influence. Establish new colonies for a new Commodore in a sector to gain even more influence. Gain enough influence and you can be promoted to Admiral!&#10;&#10;Space Base is a quick-to-learn, quick-to-play dice game using the core &quot;I roll, everyone gets stuff&quot; mechanism seen in other games. It's also a strategic engine builder using a player board (your space base) and tableaus of ship cards you can buy and add to your board. The cards you buy and the order you buy them in have interesting implications on your engine beyond just the ability on the card you buy, making for a different type of engine construction than seen in similar games. Players can take their engine in a number of directions: long odds and explosive gains, low luck and steady income, big end-game combos to launch from last to first, or a mix-and-match approach. Ultimately, Space Base is a game you can just start playing and teach everyone how to play in the first round or two and has a satisfying blend of dice-chucking luck and challenging strategic choices.&#10;&#10;"

Major General Truscott's U.S. VI Corps landed along a 45 mile stretch of French Coast with the objective of isolating the major German forces defending the western part of France and linking up with the Normandy forces breaking out of their beachhead. The southern beachhead would be secured in only 2 days and the Americans were well established inland. With scattered and only occasionally strong resistance, the Americans and now landed French advanced north up the Rhone valley along highway N-7 &mdash; heading quickly toward the key rail and road junction at Aix-en-Provence. This was captured on August 19th. At this point, General Truscott activated a provisional force called Task Force Butler. This roughly regimentally sized unit raced ahead of the main force with the objective of capturing the main route of escape for the German Army. The Task Force set up a defensive position in the high ground to the north of Mont&eacute;limar. They were to hold until relieved. The Germans would throw everything they could at Task Force Butler in a race to return to Germany before the larger Allied Formations coming up from the south and east would join Task Force Butler.&#10;&#10;In the end, both sides could claim victory &mdash; the Allies mauled the enemy forces with the Germans suffering 2100 casualties with several thousand soldiers and large amounts of heavy equipment unable to escape. The Allies suffered only 1200 casualties but much of the German Army did get away and a great opportunity was lost.&#10;&#10;Mont&eacute;limar: Anvil of Fate is the third game in the Company Scale System and the first game in the Liberation series covering battles in Western Europe in 1944 and 1945.

Deduce the culprit from among the four persons. However, there may be a &quot;phantom&quot; who attempts to confuse you.&#10;&#10;In the base game, ten cards are dealt to four players, so players have hands of only two or three cards. As in a trick-taking game, each player plays one card face down in turn order. While doing this, each player forecasts who has the highest card (that is, the culprit). Each card has a color (suit), and you have to show that color when you play the card; this allows opponents to narrow down the number of your card, but some cards have a special effect, so big numbers don't win automatically. Points are awarded to whoever played the highest card (the culprit) and to whoever correctly forecasted that player winning.&#10;&#10;Tricks and the Phantom is not just card luck. It is a strategy inference game that requires you to read each other's psychology.&#10;&#10;"

It is like Once Upon a Time plus Pictionary, with story prompts that are inspired by popular and quirky comics themes and trends. While this is a game about drawing, it's not a game in which the best artist wins as your strategy and ability to adapt quickly matters much more. Points are awarded for strategy and following the rules, not artistic ability. However, if you are an artist, it is undeniable that Cartooner can be a great companion for you as well. A solo mode has been designed just for that.&#10;&#10;The game plays out in four rounds that build up in intensity, and each round is five minutes long. Your goal is to get the most fame points at each round using a combination of your theme cards and the fleeting market trends that are valid only for one round. In the end, the player with the most fame wins&hellip;but every player walks away with a comic of their own creation.&#10;&#10;Start by drawing three theme cards at random to determine what your comic will be about. Will your comic involve Dinosaurs, Secret Hideouts and Car Chases? Werewolves, Obnoxious Coworkers and The Desire to Be Famous? Or Pirates, Blobs and The Last Human on Earth? When time is up, follow these simple rules to score the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Rule 1: You get 1 Fame point for each Theme you express in your comic in a way the other players can recognize by drawing it or writing it in a word balloon. &#10;    Rule 2: You get 2 Fame for drawing something in every Panel, no matter how simple. &#10;    Rule 3: You get 2 more Fame for keeping it succinct by using three or fewer Word Balloons on the page. It's that easy.&#10;&#10;&#10;Rounds two through four introduce an element of strategy: Trend Cards. Each Trend Card gives you new ways to earn Fame points for that round. Unlike Themes, which are personal, Trend Cards represent the market and affect every player in the game. Your fickle readers may want you to inject Superheroes, Funny Animals, Medical drama, Disaster stories, Mystery,  Romance, or any one of 52 Trends into your story. It's every artist's dilemma: stick to your original story, or sell out for Fame?&#10;&#10;Each round brings more Panels to draw and Trends to chase. Plus, each round has more Fame in play than the round before, so the outcome is up in the air until the very end.&#10;&#10;When the final round ends, the winner is the one with the most Fame Tokens, but every player ends the game with their own comic.&#10;&#10;With literally hundreds of thousands of possible combinations of story prompts, you'll never run out of ideas.&#10;&#10;"
