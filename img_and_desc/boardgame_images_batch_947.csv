Each player has four cards in hand and plays a card by turn, using the action on the card, and after that draws another card from one of the three decks. Action cards help each player strengthen their team's characters, gain coins or steal coins from other teams, declare war and hire Scholars. Every character has a certain symbol, other than their special abilities, and can be strengthened by placing tokens on said character's mat. For example, the Treasurer provides more coins, the Commander becomes more powerful in war, the Sultan gains more influence in hiring Scholars and etc.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained by two means; scientific points provided by Scholars, and military points gained from war. The game is played in 4 eras in which different Scholars emerge and at the end of the 4th era, the team with most victory points prevails.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The game's deck is comprised of cards numbered 1-15, with cards of rank 6 and 10 missing. The deck contains multiple copies of each card, depending on player count (4 each at 2-4 players/5 each at 5+ players). In addition to a rank, each card has a point value, which depends on the rank&rsquo;s strength. The object of the game is for players to be the first to play all of their cards to the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player may play one, two, or three cards to a single, central meld. Playable meld-types are:&#10;&#10;-Single: Any one card. (1 &lt; 7 &lt; 14)&#10;-Set: Any two or more cards of equal rank. (1,1,1 &lt; 14,14,14)&#10;-Run: Any two or more cards of consecutive rank. (1,2,3 &gt; 11,12,13)&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player chooses to do one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;-Overwrite: Play a higher ranked meld, which matches the meld-type and size of the central meld.&#10;-Add: Attach a card or cards to the central meld, making sets/runs longer.&#10;-Pass: A player who can not or chooses not to play into the central meld may pass. Once a player passes, they are out for the trick.&#10;&#10;A trick ends once 1 of 4 things happens:&#10;&#10;-All but one player passes. &#10;-A player adds the fourth card to an active set of a like-numbered meld (or fifth in a 5+ player game).&#10;-A player adds the fifth card of a run.&#10;-A player plays a meld that follows the &ldquo;Rule of 8&rsquo;s&rdquo; (See Below).&#10;&#10;The last player to have played a card to the meld in any of these situations above clears the trick and leads the next. A lead player must always play one, two, or three cards and may never &quot;Pass&quot;.&#10;&#10;Once one player has played their final card(s) to the table, the round ends immediately. The other players then score the points indicated on the cards left in their hands. Rounds are played until one player has 20 or more points, leaving the player(s) with the least points the winner(s).&#10;&#10;Rule of 8&rsquo;s:&#10;All cards of rank 8 in the deck are worth the most points in the game. However, these cards have a special function. When a rank 8 card is played to a trick (ie. A single 8, a set of 8&rsquo;s, a run of either 7,8 or 7,8,9) the trick is immediately cleared and the player who played the &ldquo;Rule of 8&rsquo;s&rdquo; clears the trick and leads the next. The only time the Rule of 8&rsquo;s will not function is when an 8 is included in the opening meld of any trick.&#10;&#10;"

All of the characters are represented by either miniatures or cardboard standees, with the Hexgyas and Grandragon being much larger than the other characters.&#10;&#10;What's more, these two figures are the most important ones because if you lose your main character, then you lose the game.&#10;&#10;To set up, players choose a starting configuration for their large figure and seven smaller ones on their half of the game board. The Hexgyas and Grandragon stand in one of the five large hexagonal spaces, while their supporting characters occupy the smaller hexes that form a network around these larger hexes. Each player positions three pieces of armor around their large figure, designating two other positions around their perimeter as a weak spot and a critical weak spot. Players also customize a control deck for their large character with three attack cards and three special cards that are added to their six movement cards.&#10;&#10;The game lasts at most five rounds, and each round consists of four phases. Players first choose initiative from a hand of five initiative cards and program three control cards for their large figure. During the control phase, players carry out their actions, moving their large figure and attempting to inflict damage on the opponent. The command phase allows the supporting characters to attack one another, but also to infiltrate the opponent's giant to discover weak spots and possibly inflict damage or pull control cards from their hand.&#10;&#10;Deal ten damage to the opponent's larger figure, and you win instantly. If no one has been taken down after five rounds, then the Grandragon wins, having overcome the initiative advantage wielded by the Hexgyas.&#10;&#10;"

For instance, if a card is to be placed into a player's tableau, you must try to place it next to the card that currently has the corresponding die on it; the die is then &quot;tipped&quot; onto the card, changing its value accordingly.  In the game's theme, the higher the value of a die, the more fulfilled a player is in that aspect of their life.&#10;&#10;After 9 rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"
