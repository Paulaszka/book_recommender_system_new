Unfortunately, you're not the advancing army either.&#10;&#10;Instead, you play a member of the general's staff. You were offered money by captains of a few of the remaining companies.

Jigger the retreat orders to put your cronies as far from danger as possible.&#10;&#10;Of course, everybody else on the general's staff was bribed to put their cronies ahead of yours.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a track, with the companies represented by six tokens corresponding to each of the Decktet suits. Each player starts with a secret goal card, telling them which units they want to have do well. Each turn, players draft from a pool of cards, moving the units that correspond to their card's suit a total distance corresponding to their card's rank.&#10;&#10;"

I'm very pleased with them, but this may mean that the description here will change. - Alex&#10;&#10;SEVEN WEEKS is a 2 to 3 player Euro-style war game that aims to recreate the maneuvering, bloodshed, and events of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 in the German and Bohemian theaters. (The Italian front is also represented as an influence upon forces available and overall morale.)&#10;&#10;Players represent the Prussians and their North German allies, the Bavarian and Federal German forces (including Baden, Hesse Darmstadt, Nassau, and Wurttemburg amongst others) , and the Habsburgs (who also control the Saxons, Hanoverians, and Kurhessen/Hesse-Kassel forces). The Bavarian and Habsburg forces must work together to stop the Prussians from achieving the historical victory - a crushing blow for the Habsburgs, a defeat for independent states in Germany, and the beginning of a long era of Prussian hegemony over German affairs.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes hand management and card driven mechanics. The map is a traditional hex map, depicting major population centers, fortresses, and rail lines. The combat system uses a system of &quot;tactical cards&quot; and battlefield deployment, implementing some fresh ideas intended to represent the player's role as the commander in chief of a military establishment and the necessity of relying upon the battlefield doctrine practiced by his/her forces. Prussian forces, for example, heavily rely upon open order formation and &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; technique, while the Habsburgs are fond of the &quot;Stosstaktik&quot; approach and rely upon a superior artillery arm. The game is completely diceless.&#10;&#10;The aim is to produce an exciting wargame that can easily be played within two hours. The game is currently in playtesting, and hoping for a &quot;Sooner than Later&quot; publication date as we look for a publisher.&#10;&#10;"

When players land on a tile containing opposing snowmen, they must melt one down or mug one. If the mugger&rsquo;s victim capitulates, the mugger receives a coin that he can use to alter his movement or defend himself with a force field; otherwise, the victim is melted down one piece. Some tiles act as traps; if all your pieces are trapped, they melt, one by one. The winner is the last player with any snowmen left on the board.&#10;&#10;"
