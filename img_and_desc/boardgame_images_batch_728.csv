On these lazy breezy days, you may see cats lying on the roof, inside the bushes, under the cars, or any other funny places they see fit. During your visit today, take a walk around the blocks to see how many cats you can find in Cat Town.&#10;&#10;Cat Town combines memory, hand-management and deck-manipulation, with players scoring points in three ways: finding cats, collecting items, and playing Travel notes cards. To set up, shuffle the deck of Cat, Item, and Action cards, deal two cards to each player, then create four or six &quot;blocks&quot; of cards, based on the number of players. On a turn, a player takes one of four actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then add the top card on that block to their hand.&#10;    Move their cat token across one of the neighboring blocks, then reveal the top card on that block, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.&#10;    Playing an Item or Action card for the effect described in the text, then taking the action shown on the bonus icon.&#10;    Revealing a card at random from their hand, keeping it in front of them if it's a Cat or Item and discarding it otherwise.&#10;&#10;&#10;Each Cat in front of you as well as each pair of Items with the same name is worth 1 point. A Travel note played with three additional cards from the hand is also worth 1 points. The first player to score 6 points wins.&#10;&#10;"

In a drinking party in Japan, 'reverse' means &quot;to reverse what you have ingested&quot;. It is a mild expression of 'vomit'.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, you are assigned a character, who has their own alcohol capacity and beverage preferences. Their favorite beverage's alcohol counts zero, and hated one counts double toward their capacity.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you may choose to quaff a beverage (draw a card), and if the total amount of alcohol exceeds your character's capacity, the character 'reverses' and you are out of the round with no victory points. You should stop drinking before your character 'reverses'.&#10;&#10;When any character would quaff a beverage (after drawing a card but before resolving it), you may make an 'alhara' (alcohol harassment) to force any character (including yours) to quaff that beverage. You have limited times of 'alhara' attempts.&#10;&#10;At the end of round, each non-'reversed' player gains victory points according to beverages their character has quaffed.

We found ourselves with 10-15 players (5-7 couple) quite often. The Resistance cannot be played with that many people. We could play Werewolf but I do not like how you eliminate players.&#10;&#10;Second I wanted to add a new element to the social deduction game. Players loyalty can change during game play in Facility 342. What better scenario than body snatchers.&#10;&#10;Lastly I wanted a social deduction game that had a role playing feel to it. In my game you have to physically leave the game table to go on a mission with another player. This allows things to happen in private that can affect the whole game. This also allows players to talk in private about their plans and they can use this time to figure out what is going on, or trick players without the interruptions of other players.&#10;&#10;"

In the game of Kamozza, you are exporters and your goal is to load as much of your freight as possible into ships.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has the same set of freight cards of various loads.&#10;&#10;There are two docks on the table. Each round, two ships come into these docks. The one of these two ships has larger load capacity, and the other has smaller. Then each player secretly chooses a freight card from their hand and destination ship to load the freight. When they are revealed, count up the load for each ship. If the load exceeds the ship's capacity, the ship is sunk. Otherwise freight is successfully loaded and victory points are scored to the successful players.&#10;&#10;After the fifth round, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is simple but exciting, and its artwork is cute. You can play another game using the same cards. You should load your freight from heavier to lighter, but if you and other player play the same card, both cards cancel each other and you miss a chance to load.

Each player receives a two-fruit basket to start with and all other cards are shuffled. The starting dealer lays out, face up, a number of cards equal to the number of players. In turn, beginning with the dealer, each player chooses a card and places it in front of them. A player not wishing or unable to take a card instead takes one of the trees (if one is available in the middle). This tree may be returned to the center on a subsequent turn in order to take any fruit from the discard pile (instead of taking a card from the middle).&#10;&#10;Each basket starts with two or three fruits already in it. A fruit card can only be added to the basket if that fruit is not yet present. Once a basket has all six fruits, all of its cards are stacked and turned sideways. Any number of baskets can be worked on at one time, but a fruit cannot be taken without a basket to go in.&#10;&#10;The pineapple is a wild fruit, but each basket can only have one. If the bomb comes up in a deal, the entire turn is skipped and all cards from the middle are discarded. The rotten apple results in the dealer discarding one entire incomplete basket of theirs, if one exists.&#10;&#10;After each round, the dealer role passes to the left. The game ends when there are not enough cards to fill the center. 5 points are awarded for each complete basket, with 1 point for each fruit card added to an incomplete basket.&#10;&#10;Rules are also included for longer and shorter variants.&#10;&#10;"

For the past 75 years, Viking raiding parties from Norway and Denmark have been terrorizing the coasts of England with &lsquo;hit and run&rsquo; attacks. The treasures and stories gained from these attacks have allowed the Norsemen to raise huge hosts of eager men seeking glory and riches. These armies now stand poised to thunder across England where they will settle and farm the fertile land they conquer. The divided English kingdoms are unprepared for this impending onslaught. The Vikings are coming!&#10;&#10;In 878: Vikings &ndash; Invasions of England, players control the invading Vikings or the English nobles who are trying to withstand the invasion. Viking players either play as Norsemen Viking freeman or as the fearless Viking shock troops known as Berserkers. The English play as the Housecarl, the Kings&rsquo; household troops, or as the Thegns who were regional noble Leaders. The English players will also be able to call up the peasant levies, called the Fyrd, to defend their cities.&#10;&#10;Players for each side strategize together in order to coordinate their strategies. Each side attempts to control Cities on the map to win. The English start the game controlling all of England but a Viking Leader will invade from the sea each Turn. The English players raise reinforcements from cities they control, while the Vikings must wait for a new invasion for reinforcements. The game ends when the Treaty of Wedmore is called and the side controlling the most cities wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

At the beginning of a round, each player has four turns to set their own scoring and goals for the trick-taking that follows, and this is mostly done by betting. Players can bet on tricks taken, on the number of cards of a given color in your takes, on the last trick, on the highest card taking, or even on the failure of your opponent. Instead of betting, players can choose other actions as well.&#10;&#10;Players can have up to four bets, but only those that you've won will earn you coins. For this reason and because the odds of the bets differ (x2, x3, x4, x5), sometimes instead of betting players will want to take other actions, such as changing one of their cards, doubling an odd, becoming the starting player in the trick phase, changing one of their bets, etc. This is where the tactical depth of Sponsio comes in: finding the best combinations to build your highest score!&#10;&#10;Sponsio is a family-strategy game that can be won in two ways: collecting 30 coins or winning 9 bets in a row.&#10;&#10;"

During a first phase (Earning Phase), players draw four cards, each showing three sections of different resources. Two of these sections are gradually blocked by the player, thus leaving one section. The resources shown on this section are the ones the player gets. During this phase, they have to decide which section is the best one; while the upper section of the cards offers many resources, it also results in unwanted Corruption Points. The middle and the lower sections offer fewer resources, but also less Corruption.&#10;&#10;After that, the Action Phase takes place and the players must use their resources wisely while having the choice from different kinds of actions in order to get Fame Points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a certain number of rounds have been played or somebody reaches the corruption limit.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the one with the highest amount of Fame Points or the one with the fewest Corruption Points.
