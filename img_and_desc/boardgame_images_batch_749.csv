Players work to create the most promising design to be chosen for production. Each turn players draft cards into their hands as cards are laid out on the board. Players strategically place negotiator chips between the cards they want, using their alignment and position to determine who has the most influence over a desired card. Once all negotiators and tokens are placed, influence is calculated and the winners of each card is determined.&#10;&#10;Once obtained, cards can be played for points, adding value to your ark, or discarded for resources. Each card represents a different component of the ark &mdash; locations, items, personnel &mdash; and players will find unique synergies between cards as well as their player color's unique power. Asymmetry and complex interactions add layers of strategy that lead to a unique experience each time you play.&#10;&#10;"

The two nations clashed for over a decade, with each experiencing triumphs and defeats. Following the Battle of the Great Plains in 203 BC, a ceasefire was negotiated. It was broken following a Carthaginian attack on a stranded Roman fleet in the Gulf of Tunis. Determined to finally win the war, Roman General Scipio Africanus led an invasion force into North Africa, the Carthaginian homeland. The opposing armies met near the town of Zama. Despite being outnumbered, the Romans were able to defeat the Carthaginians. With that victory the Romans had effectively won the war.&#10;&#10;Zama is part of DG&rsquo;s Battles of the Ancient World series, that emphasizes simple but realistic design features to show critical aspects of classical era combat.

The five-week battle was some of the bloodiest fighting in the Pacific. In one of the costliest intelligence failures of the war, the planners had completely misjudged the situation that would face the Marines. The beaches had been described as excellent and the advance inland was expected to be easy. Instead, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of soft black volcanic ash that brought the normally rapidly moving Marines down to a slow plod. In addition, the lack of a vigorous response led the Marines to believe that the bombardment had completely suppressed the defenses. However, Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten. Understanding that his forces were insufficient to defeat the massive American invasion force, he had decided to defend the island in-depth.&#10;&#10;In D-Day at Iwo Jima, designer Joe Youst builds on John Butterfield&rsquo;s award winning solitaire game system. The player controls three US Marine divisions against a determined Japanese defense. The no-dice combat system highlights the unknown enemy deployments and coordination of the right weapon systems and tactics.&#10;&#10;Players familiar with the previous three games in the system will be able to quickly set up and play this latest version.

Each bean card has a number that indicates how many cards of that type are in the deck, as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; on the bottom of the card that tells you how many Talers you earn when you harvest those beans from your field. The more beans of a type that you have, the more Talers you earn.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player must plant the first card in hand into one of their fields, and they may plant the second card. All cards in a field must be of the same type. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and optionally trades those cards and cards in their hand with cards in the hands of other players; all traded cards must be planted, not returned to hand. Players can trade cards from anywhere in their hand, and doing so lets you set up good plays in future turns. To end a turn, a player draws cards and places them at the back of their hand. You can harvest a field at any time to collect Talers, keeping some cards to represent these coins and returning others to the discard pile to be recycled when the deck is shuffled.&#10;&#10;Bohnanza: 20 Jahre adds one new type of bean to the game: the spring bean. Whenever a player harvests two spring beans, they draw cards from the deck equal to one more than the number of players. They plant one of these cards for themselves, then pass the cards around the table so that each other player can do the same. The final card is returned to the active player, who keeps it for a Taler.&#10;&#10;"

This game has three modes of play: hidden identity mode (saboteurs may exist), limited communication co-operative mode (players use strange languages - frog, robot, dog, cat, no words), and random co-operative mode (players may not choose walls).&#10;&#10;In hidden identity mode, players are secretly assigned a role: Builder or Saboteur (Fanatic is the 2nd Edition). A Builder's goal is to build an eight-tier tower, and a Saboteur's goal is to make one of the builders collapse the tower.&#10;&#10;The 2nd edition, published in 2017, kept the gameplay the same, but made significant changes to the components of the 1st edition (2016). The original edition had the player's Height cards also acting as the actual floors of the tower. The Height card had a sort of Pac-man shape. By combining two pieces, you made the hexagonal floor you would build. The player building the level was meant to arrange the floor parts to match the wall parts. That is, if the heights combined are a 3 and a 5, the 3-wall goes over the 3-floor, and the 5-wall goes over the 5-floor.&#10;&#10;The 2017 edition did away with this physical mechanism; instead, players had normal playing cards numbered 1 to 5, and wholly separate floor tiles to actually build with. This edition also introduced a new card 'Break Down The Wall', which means that only one wall piece is used in the level being built. Also, in the new edition, the tower starts with a floor, and on your turn you place two walls and then the floor. The new edition also has a sturdier box and is slightly larger.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player has three cards in their hand. In your turn, you place a floor card, which is numbered 1-5, face-up, and other players place a floor card face-down, saying a hint (saboteurs might be misleading you). Then you choose and reveal one of these face-down cards (the unused go unseen to a discard pile), take a floor tile (in the 2016 edition - combine the chosen card with yours to make a hexagonal floor), and take two walls that correspond to the floor numbers. You must place the floor and the walls on top of tower without making it collapse. Height of walls gradually vary over floor numbers, so you should pick the same number if you want to build an upright tower.&#10;&#10;If you are a saboteur, it's up to you whether you secretly or explicitly betray the builders. You may try to mislead builders to take unbalanced walls, or boldly build up a skewed tower in your turn. But beware. Your side loses the game if you make the tower collapse yourself. You may also reveal your identity during your turn, in which case builders need to complete one more floor to win the game.&#10;&#10;In the co-operative mode, players may loosely discuss which card ought to be selected (you cannot say obvious info, such as 'my card is a 3!'). But discussions are done in foreign languages - dog, cat, frog, robot, and no words. You are dealt a card and can only use your given language to communicate.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a solitaire but only in random mode. You randomly take two floor cards and use the corresponding walls to build one tier. Repeat the process until you build 12-tier tower without it falling.&#10;&#10;There is an instructional manga by &#228;&#184;&#131;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#230;&#180;&#139;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#229;&#186;&#151; (Nanairo Youhinten) in the first edition.

These are online on the Game Market webpage for the game (see links below).&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;BABEL is a dexterity game where you build a tower using walls of&#10;unoriented heights.&#10;You may play the game in 3 variations:&#10;&#10;     Hidden identity mode - the traitor secretly tries to collapse the tower&#10;     Co-op mode - as postfin of the myth, build with limited communications&#10;     Solitaire mode - build the tower as high as you can with random draw of walls&#10;&#10;&#10;Difference between the first edition and the 2017 new version:&#10;The following improvements were made from the version sold at TGM2016.&#10;1: Introduced the &quot;Height Card&quot;. No need to combine the floor cards anymore.&#10;2: Introduced the &quot;Break down the wall&quot; card. When played, the active&#10;player must build the tower with only 1 wall card this turn.&#10;3: Construction order for each turn altered, from floor=&gt;wall to wall=&gt;floor.&#10;4: More sturdier
