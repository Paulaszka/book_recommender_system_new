Do you have what it takes? The club members are an unusual bunch to say the least. Drawn from diverse backgrounds, some are explorers, others are scholars, but all the ladies and gentlemen are drawn together by one thing &ndash; the occult!&#10;&#10;Their curiosity and thirst for knowledge of the arcane arts draws them towards it like so many moths to an open flame. In their plush and exclusive London Club they meet to discuss their latest exploits - the artifacts uncovered, the diabolical schemes foiled, and the supernatural terrors they have hunted.&#10;&#10;The unofficial motto of the club is &rsquo;Possession is 9/10th of the lore.&rsquo; An offhand joke maybe, yet many say it perfectly captures the club&rsquo;s healthy spirit of competition and the very real danger its members face every time they set out on another paranormal investigation.&#10;&#10;In Ghost Hunter players take on the role of  new Infernal Club members and set out on a quest to the notorious Blackmoor House to compete against their fellow hunters to capture as many of the unholy spirits that haunt it as possible without succumbing to the terror and ending up haunted for life!&#10;&#10;Ghost Hunter is a card game for 2 &ndash; 7 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.&#10;&#10;"

The cargo mover can try to bribe the controller to make this trouble go away, but if that doesn't work an Inspector, the highest rating, can look at three cargo cards, a Captain two, and a Lieutenant one. If the controller reveals an illegal good, the owner of that card gets to seize all of the cargo, placing it and her controller in her warehouse; if all the goods are legal, the shipper claims the cargo in the warehouse and the controller in hand.

If she wishes, she can change any die face to a lower number as long as that number is one that she rolled. If she wishes, she then places tokens on the grid to match the die combinations rolled. For example, if she rolls 5-4-4-3-3-2, she could change all the dice to 2, then cover the six 2s space on her grid; she could also change the 5 to a 4 and the 3s to 2s, then cover the three 4s space and the three 2s space. A player doesn't have to place tokens on her turn.&#10;&#10;Once someone places her 18th token on her grid, the game ends after everyone has had the same number of turns, then players score points. Each token in the outer border is worth 1-6 crowns, depending on where it's located; each token in the inner grid is worth points only if it's part of a complete row of five tokens, and you score points (3-20, depending on the row) only for those completed rows, not for each covered space in the grid.

Each player will control a six-member gang competing to survive with only their instincts, a quick draw, and dynamite.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns. Each player has a home base card in front of them. Each turn, the player whose turn it is flips open a card from the common deck. The other players now have a chance to react.&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Talkin&rsquo; Iron card is revealed, players can choose to make an offensive or a defensive move. If players want to take a shot, they can slap one hand on the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card and simultaneously make a pistol-finger with their other hand, pointing at any other player. Only one player gets to actually take a shot - the one who slaps the Talkin&rsquo; Iron card first. Instead of trying to slap the gun, players can slap into a home base by slapping any of the home bases on the table. Only one player&rsquo;s hand can be in a home base at a time. Players who slap into a home base can&rsquo;t be hit by a player who takes a shot, and they can safely keep their hand on that home base until they&rsquo;re forced to move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Big Gun card is revealed, players can slap it to take a shot or slap into a home base. Just like a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, only one player can use it to take a shot - the first one to slap the card and simultaneously point a pistol-finger at another player. Unlike a Talkin&rsquo; Iron, a Big Gun is extraordinarily destructive, and damages players even if they&rsquo;re in a home base.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    If a Gold card is revealed, players can take the card into their possession by slapping it. If you point at another player while slapping the gold, the player you point at takes the gold instead. Gold is required to activate most gang&rsquo;s special powers.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When a Move! card is revealed, everyone needs to slap into a home base. If a player is already in a home base, they need to slap into a new home base. The last player to slap into a new home base loses one member of their gang. If anyone mistakenly slaps the Move! card, they lose one gang member, everyone else is safe regardless of where they slapped, and the turn ends.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns until only one gang is left standing.&#10;&#10;"

Gather your men, pay your knights, and assert your claim. Everyone will recognize the strongest and richest as the rightful monarch.&#10;&#10;In Melee you want to be the first person to capture an opposing castle (at which point the game ends immediately) or to have the most land and gold at the end of the year. Money is tight, and gold is used in the game both to build new units and to attack. The more gold you have and spend on your troops, the more motivated they will be and the higher your probability of success.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a Castle, one unit of foot soldiers, and 15 gold coins. The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game.&#10;&#10;The game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income.&#10;&#10;To attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options.&#10;&#10;The different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.&#10;&#10;"
