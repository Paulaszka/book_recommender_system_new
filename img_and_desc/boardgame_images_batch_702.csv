War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.&#10;&#10;Indian Empires is a complete game, using the same game engine as Soldier Emperor, our strategic game of the Napoleonic Wars. It can be played separately, or together with Soldier Emperor; our Dreams of Empire book includes a linking map and the rules and pieces for its use.&#10;&#10;Indian Empires is a new edition of our long out-of print Soldier Raj. It includes over a dozen scenarios from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces are decadently thick tiles; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are original works of art by Terry Moore Strickland. As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Emperor, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation's enemies.&#10;&#10;"

The player&rsquo;s individual aircraft, each represented by a stickered block, must confront the mighty &ldquo;combat box&rdquo; formation of the United States Army Air Force,  a deadly terrain of B-17 Flying Fortresses. The game is a broad strokes depiction that presents the arc of the desperate air war. Stretching from late 1942 to early 1945, Skies Above the Reich follows that trajectory in a series of missions strung together to make a campaign. Each mission will take a half hour or more to play, while a campaign can last anywhere between 6 to 60 missions.&#10;&#10;The Mission&#10;You select pilots and &ldquo;attachments,&rdquo; such as gun pods, rockets, or added armor. You may also augment your attack with auxiliary aircraft such as Ju88s, Fw190s, or later in the war, jet propelled Me262s, the answer to the deadly P-51 escort fighter. Time in a mission is limited, so you must do your best to wreck the bomber formation as quickly as possible, while bringing home as many pilots as you can in order to muster a force for the next mission.&#10;The mission is played on a formation map that depicts as many as twenty-one B-17 bombers in a tight array. The game comes with two double-sided map boards (four maps in all) that as a set chronicle the development and increasing lethality of the bomber formation. Each map is a bigger and more lethal terrain than its predecessor.&#10;Will you strike the formation from the nose or from the tail?  Will your fighters make a dead-level attack or will they drop bombs on the formation from above? Will you split your squadron to attack from multiple angles, or will they charge at the bombers in successive waves? Will you even have time for this kind of maneuver?&#10;What if you encounter the bombers&rsquo; &ldquo;little friends,&rdquo; fighter escort lurking nearby? How will you handle them if you do, or will you even try? Will you organize part of your force to tangle with escort, or will you arm your entire contingent to focus on the bombers?&#10;&#10;The Campaign&#10;As tough as each mission can be, the real challenge is the campaign where you watch as your roster of pilots gradually shrinks. Some pilots will survive long enough to acquire ace skills, but you will be forced to replace downed or wounded pilots, and those young newcomers come &ldquo;green&rdquo;. Some campaigns will end simply because you run out of pilots.&#10;Full Campaigns follow the chronology of &ldquo;seasons,&rdquo; each comprising a number of missions that your squadron flies striving to disrupt the American bomber raids. In a full campaign you must endure all seven seasons, keeping your squadron intact while making an impact on the relentless wave of bomber formations roaring over your homeland. A short campaign challenges you to win a single season, although you may wish to extend it to a second or third season depending on how well you fare.&#10;Each season represents a distinct period of the war, as the campaign traverses the history of the air war. Bombers become more heavily armed but so too do your own Bf109 fighters. Early seasons are characterized by smaller formations, while seasons in the middle of the war are notable for the lack of fighter escort. And later seasons will put the squeeze on your squadron.&#10;&#10;Basic and Advanced Games&#10;In the basic game your goal is to knock bombers out of formation, or destroy them outright. The advanced game adds &ldquo;pursuit&rdquo; where you dispatch fighters to chase after and intercept bombers knocked out of the formation. Played out on an 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; map depicting a single bomber, pursuit makes the advanced game even more challenging.&#10;&#10;The Two Player Game&#10;You may also play this as a (un)cooperative game. Players each command a squadron of fighters and attack a formation of bombers together.

It is part of the Nerf Rebelle line, designed to appeal primarily to girls.&#10;&#10;This game has a two-sided board and can be played in two ways.  One side of the board is a combination of a dexterity game and tic-tac-toe.  The board is laid out on the floor or a table and players take turns throwing plastic discs, trying to land them in one of the spaces on the 3x3 grid.  Players may of course knock other players' discs off the board.  Like tic-tac-toe, the first player to get three discs in a row wins.&#10;&#10;The other side of the board is a target game.  Players take turns throwing their discs at the board, trying to land them in scoring circles.  Smaller circles have higher point values.  After each player has thrown all his or her discs, the highest total score wins.&#10;&#10;Because the rules are minimal (and conveyed only with pictures), player will have to create house rules to answer lots of questions, such as whether players may pick up and rethrow discs if no one get three in a row in the tic-tac-toe version and how much of a disc must be inside a scoring circle to score points in the target game.&#10;&#10;"

Tasked by the Emperor to explore ancient temples, forgotten labyrinths, and beast-haunted caverns, they seek out artifacts hidden by the gods themselves, hunt creatures of myth, and face enemies that would use dark magic against the empire.&#10;&#10;Broken Legions: Fantasy Skirmish Wargames in the Roman Empire is a set of fantasy skirmish rules for a war unknown to history, fought in the shadows of the Roman Empire. Various factions recruit small warbands to fight in tight, scenario-driven battles that could secure the mystical power to defend &mdash; or crush &mdash; Rome. A points system allows factions to easily build a warband, and mercenaries and free agents may also be hired to bolster a force. Heroes and leaders may possess a range of skills, traits, and magical abilities, but a henchman's blade can be just as sharp, and a campaign can see even the lowliest henchman become a hero of renown.&#10;&#10;Mark Latham's blog, which provides additional rules, discussion, and FAQS.&#10;&#10;https://thelostvictorian.blogspot.com/&#10;&#10;"

The player with the highest Lore score wins the game. Ties are resolved by awarding victory to the player with the most Lore earned from Bardic Talents. Secondary ties are resolved by remaining Coins. If a tie still remains, toast each other&rsquo;s success and share victory.&#10;&#10;Legends of Goblins Past conjures the confabulist in us all.

The influential guilds and patricians dominate city life; and if you want to accomplish something, you need to be in the good graces of the right people.&#10;&#10;In Ulm, players try to expand their spheres of influence and to make optimal use of the hustle and bustle on the marketplace around the cathedral. The game has one simple basic rule: Push 1 Action tile into the Cathedral area and carry out the 3 associated actions! This way, the Cathedral tower gets taller and taller over the game. The objective of the game is plain and simple: try to accumulate the most victory points through activities in different areas of city life in Ulm and do it before the end of the 10th round, when the construction of the Cathedral is concluded.&#10;&#10;Who will make the best use of his means and resources over time and will go down in the annals of the city&rsquo;s history as an important citizen?&#10;&#10;"

High-ranking personalities prevent the members of the opposing family from using their subjects for their own purposes and from erecting valuable buildings &mdash; but everything comes at a price. Who will lead his family to fame and honor?&#10;&#10;Text from publisher:&#10;&#10;The position of the leader of the empire is vacant. But who has what it takes to become the new king? In order to increase their power, the contenders for the throne rally the country and its people around themselves.&#10;&#10;Who will make the best use of the influence of important personalities and engage his competitors in conflicts without suffering damage himself? Rival Kings is a stalwart card game from HUCH! &amp; friends.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each cycle, each player chooses one Character card and places it face down in front of him. Once all players have done so, they turn them over simultaneously. The Character cards determine the order of play, the number of possible actions, and potential conflicts. Low-ranking characters have more actions at their disposal, but they may act only after the higher-ranking characters. In addition, each character may come into conflict with certain other characters. When this happens, the higher-ranking character may take one action from the inferior character and carry it out immediately; this action is then no longer available to the lower ranked during his turn.&#10;&#10;After the Character cards have been played and potential conflicts have been resolved, the action phase begins. Now, depending on the action, a player can take money, get rid of Conflict markers, recruit subjects, or buy a building. Players try to secure good combinations of buildings and subjects for themselves in order to get a high score in the end. Besides this, the subjects recruited during the game provide different advantages that can have a crucial impact on the course of the game. However, only one subject is active per player &ndash; if a new Subject card is added, it covers the player's previously laid-out bonus.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the card piles has been depleted. The player who has collected the best combinations and has as few Conflict markers as possible lying in front of him has the best chance of assuming the throne.&#10;&#10;"
