Voros, Company A, 46th Infantry, Americal Division, March 1971.&#10;&#10;For most Americans, by the Spring of 1971, the &ldquo;light at the end of tunnel&rdquo; that had become the War in Vietnam was in sight. Peace talks were well underway in Paris, as was &ldquo;Vietnamization&rsquo;; President Nixon&rsquo;s official policy for turning over the bulk of the war effort and fighting to the forces of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of [South] Vietnam). As part of the transition the 23rd US Infantry Division, the &ldquo;Americal&rdquo;, was due to be rotated out of fighting and turning over its positions to ARVN&rsquo;s First Corp. The Americal had earned a bad reputation two years earlier at My Lai, and the division was subjected to a complete review and re-organization following that atrocity. The higher-ups decreed there would be no more &ldquo;screw ups&rdquo; by this unit while it served out its remaining time &ldquo;in country.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;One of the most remote American positions was Fire Base Mary Ann, not far from Chu Lai, occupied by elements of the 46th Regiment of the Americal Division. By the last week of March an ARVN artillery battery had already moved in and the base was to be completely turned-over in early April. However, the local Viet Cong (Communist South Vietnamese) commander saw a growing opportunity during the transition to strike a final blow against the Imperialist forces of the US. Deploying the elite 409th Sapper Battalion for the attack, the Communist&rsquo;s &ldquo;parting shot&rdquo; was to remind both the US and ARVN that the war was far from over.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Thanks to Indian resentment over the French surrender of their lands and the harsh policies of General Jeffery Amherst, governor-general of British North America, 20+ Indian nations rose up under the charismatic leadership of the Ottawa sachem, Pontiac and the Lenape Holy Man, Neolin. Pontiac&rsquo;s War attempts to recreate the reaction of Indian leaders to British mishandling of frontier politics and the impending colonial crisis it presaged.

Until now.&#10;&#10;One of the Regent Houses, the Envers House, has discovered how to travel to the distant worlds of the universe. And with those new worlds at their disposal to dominate and gain Power, all Houses seek to grow enough to claim the title of Earth Emperor.&#10;&#10;In Rise of an Emperor: Worlds in Conflict, each player chooses one of the seven Regent Houses (each has 10 personalized cards) and two of the different paths that exist in the world of RoaE to gain power. Each of them (Science, Religion, Economy, Politics, Subterfuge, Military and Exploration) adds 20 more cards to build its initial deck. In addition, each House has three Counselors that can be used on the Council Board.&#10;&#10;Players use cards for actions like increasing their House skills, raising their military and technological levels, building buildings, playing the characters of their House ...&#10;&#10;The large number of cards in the game (770) allows a great variety of actions. You can make and break alliances with other races and civilizations, send assassins against your rivals, or spy on them to know what they hide. You can try to make your ruler a living God or be the richest House in the Universe. You can find alien artifacts, other races and friendly or hostile civilizations, worlds and moons, powerful strategic resources, build buildings such as the Academy of War or the Intelligence Center and an endless number of other options ...&#10;&#10;Each House has a personal board to develop their civilization, and to do so many of the cards must be built before they can be used ... but both space and resources are limited.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is the ubiquitous Treaty, which limits the Houses' actions. Many of the actions in the game are illegal ones. So in order to avoid the punishment we must cover them up or legalize them ... or maybe another House can catch us in fraganti !!!&#10;&#10;Rise of an Emperor is a Civilizations 4x game, which uses mechanics like worker placement, hand and resource management, and hidden information management.

The consequences of these two wars are still felt today.&#10;&#10;In the war of 1996-97, the corrupt regime of Joseph Mobutu was overthrown by a coalition of East African countries led by Rwanda. The country formerly known as Zaire was renamed Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Mobutu was replaced by another Cold War era dinosaur, Laurent Kabila, at the helm of the huge, mineral-rich African country. One year later, however, Kabila&rsquo;s sponsors, particularly Rwanda were not pleased. A number of issues including; the expulsion of Rwandan advisers from the DRC, Kabila recruiting Hutu combatants who had fled Rwanda, and the discrimination suffered by ethnic Tutsi in eastern DRC, moved Rwanda to try to remove Kabila from power. Supported by Uganda, Congolese rebels and the Tutsi minority in DRC, the Rwandans expected to win an easy victory, just as the year before. Kabila, however, was quickly supported by expeditionary forces of Zimbabwe and Angola, among other African countries, so overthrowing him turned out much harder than expected. The resulting conflict would involve about a dozen African countries, and cost the lives of an estimated 5 million people, thus earning the name of &ldquo;World War Africa&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The Great African War&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map represents 100 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents from one to three months, with 13 game turns (GT) covering the period from August 1998 to June 2001.

Enemies are the least of your concerns.&#10;&#10;In these incredible conditions you must complete a series of tasks necessary to your continued survival.
