39489,,"A mancala game from Somalia.&#10;&#10;From Mancala World:&#10;http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Layli_Goobalay_(long_board)&#10;&#10;&quot;Layli Goobalay (literally: &quot;closing the holes&quot;) is a mancala game played in Somalia. The board is dug in the ground and the pieces are dry camel dung called salo. Slightly different variants of the same game exist, among them a more simple game, which is promoted by the Somali ethnomathematician Jama Musse Jama in Italy.&#10;&#10;The following rules were observed in 1931 by G. Marin in the area of Berbera, Somaliland, where it was (and probably still is) a favorite pastime of the Isaaq clan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Layli Goobalay is played on a board that consists of two parallel rows of 12 holes on each side. A player controls the 12 holes on his side of the board.&#10;&#10;[Holes all start with 4 seeds each.]&#10;&#10;Each move a player empties the contents of one of his holes that is not an uur and distributes one ball in each of the following holes in a clockwise direction (as observed by G. Marin).&#10;&#10;If the last ball is dropped in an occupied hole, the player takes its contents, including the last dropped ball, and continues to distribute the balls in a clockwise direction. The move ends if the last ball is dropped in an empty hole.&#10;&#10;If the last ball is dropped into an empty hole on the player's own side, he captures this last ball together with the contents of the opposite hole if it contains one, two, four or more balls. A move which captures nothing is called abar (&quot;famine&quot;).&#10;&#10;If the opposite hole contains three balls, one of these is put into the hole in which the last ball was dropped, so that each hole has two balls. These two holes now form an uur (&quot;pregnant&quot;), and both are owned to their creator. An uur may never be emptied by either player. Balls must be added to an Uur during the normal course of distribution. However, if the last ball is dropped into an uur, the move ends.&#10;&#10;The game is over when one player has no legal move left. Each side then counts the balls he has captured together with the balls in his uurs and any balls remaining on his side of the board outside of uurs. Sometimes towards the end of the game the balls continue to circulate in a repeating pattern. Then the remaining balls are divided between both players as in Oware. The player who captures most balls wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;Variant:&#10;&#10;There is a similar game played on a 2x6 board in the south of Somalia, which is always played counterclockwise. It has special rules for matches that were first described on wikimanqala:&#10;&#10;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Layli_goobalay_%28short_board%29&#10;&#10;"

Later the Scottish traveller John Galt observed Mandoli on the Greek island of Hydra in 1810.&#10;&#10;The game appears to be influenced by other mancala games played in the Osman Empire, such as Halusa and Mangala.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;RulesJohn Galt reported in 1810 the following rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;There is, however, a tolerably decent coffee-house; and in winter, even at present, card and chess players may be always found in it. I saw there to-day a game, which, not having seen elsewhere, I give you a description of. The Idriots call it Mandoli, or the almonds, and it is played at a board by two persons. Twelve hollows are scooped in the board, in two rows of six each: in each hollow six balls are placed, and the opponents take each a row. The game is commenced by the first player taking out the balls from any one of the hollows, and distributing them, one by one, successively, round the board. In the first round no balls can be captured, but in the second the contest becomes serious. The skill of the player consists in so managing his distribution, that his last all shall either fall in a hollow where there is only one, or three, or seven, or nine &amp;c. which, by the addition of his ball, are made even numbers, and in consequence become prizes. If in the distribution he makes even numbers in the two last hollows, he takes the contents of both. This is considered a great stroke. The victor is, of course, he who reckons the greatest number of prisoners.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

It is known from the Virunga mountains to the Sudanese border, and from Bangui (Central African Republic) to Arui near Uganda. Mangola is a new game which was developed after 1911 according to the ethnologue Philip Townshend and is now gradually replacing older games such as sombi and single lap mancala games. The game was spread by the Belgian colonial administration and military along rivers and roads and is the only mancala game played in the central basin (one of the few African regions where mancala games were still unknown in the 19th century). &#10;There are many local variants, probably more than 30, which have slightly different opening rules (some with simultaneous opening moves) and employ different board sizes. &#10;The game is played by adults on beautiful wooden boards with holes carved in the surface. Children, on the other hand, dig the board in the ground or draw it with chalk on concrete. &#10;It is played by both sexes, but more often by women. &#10;The following rules were reported from the capital Kinshasa by Suzanne Comhaire-Sylvain in 1952.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Mangola is a two players game. &#10;It is played on a board made of four rows of eight holes. &#10;At the beginning each hole has two seeds.&#10;&#10;Each player controls the two rows closer on his side, and only moves on these two rows. We will call the row closest to him outer row and the other one inner row &#10;Players take turns to move. &#10;The first move of each player is a special one: they redistribute the seeds by taking the contents of one hole and putting it into the next, and so one, until your side of the board is checkered with holes containing 4 seeds and empty holes.&#10;&#10;The second move of each player must begin from the left- or right-most hole of your outer or inner row. &#10;At your turn you take all the seeds from a hole on your side that contains at least two seeds and put them, one by one, in the following holes, in an anticlockwise sense. Singletons cannot be moved. &#10;If the last seed is dropped in an empty hole, you move it to the next hole and your turn ends. &#10;If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole, you take its contents including the last distributed seed and keep on sowing. &#10;If the last seed falls in a non-empty hole of the inner row, and the two opposite holes of the opponent contain seeds, you take the contents of your hole, including the seed just dropped, and the contents of both opponent's holes, and begin the next lap from the hole following the last empty hole (the same from which you began the last lap that effected the capture). &#10;When one player cannot move (his side of the board is empty or contains only singletons), he has lost the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Also, if a player only has one piece remaining, that piece automatically becomes a king.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who captures all of his/her opponent's pieces.&#10;&#10;"

Players start with 4 seeds in each pit and own the pits on the player's side of the board but this is one of the rare manqala games in which pieces are distinguishable, i.e., one player starts with white seeds and the other black. Sowing is anticlockwise starting in the pit adjacent to the starting pit and sowing one seed in each pit until the last seed is sown, without restriction on laps and sowing in the original pit if a sufficient number of seeds are in the original pit. Captures occur when the last seed is sown in an empty pit. That last seed and all seeds in the pits opposite it are captured. The winner is the player to capture more of the opponent's seeds and play continues until no more moves are possible.&#10;&#10;"

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.  (Description taken from the Scrabble entry).&#10;&#10;This Presidential edition of Scrabble is based on the familiar classic but with several interesting twists.  The letters and basic rules remain the same, but there are several important differences.  &#10;    The board is round and not square.  &#10;    All of the extra scoring spaces are replaced with the various states.  They have two effects.  The give the familiar triple letter or triple word scoring bonus.  In addition each states gives an additional bonus equal to the state&rsquo;s Electoral College value (after all other modifications).  So for instance California is a triple letter space and gives a bonus of 55 points as well (it is also way off to one side).&#10;    There is a list of extra &ldquo;words&rdquo; that are worth extra points; either 5, 10 or 15 points.  Some of these &ldquo;words&rdquo; are things like FDR or LBJ which would not ordinarily be available to use, while others are regular words like vote that just give an extra bonus.&#10;    Finally there is a deck of cards showing all of the Presidents.  Each card has a bit of historical information and gives a way to either get an extra bonus when played or change the rules in some fashion.  The Nixon card for instance allows one to play a word with one letter misspelled.  Players receive five of these cards at the start of the game, and can play at most one per turn.&#10;&#10;"

Later, the game has been spread by mine workers to Gauteng. It is closely related to games described in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game was first researched in 1917 by the British ethnograph P. A. Wagner.&#10;&#10;Moruba is traditionally played by men in the late afternoon in the shade of a tree. The game was used during war and was a social activity where men strategised about a variety of activities and events related to them, also shared advise and ideas. Language, expressions and terminology of the game signify what happens when war takes place. As women weren't allowed to go to war, they didn't play the game. In recent days, however, both genders began to play.&#10;&#10;Starting in 2003, Moruba is promoted as an indigenous sport by the CSIR's National Product Development Centre and the South African Sports Commission (SASC). There were team and individual tournaments at the Indigenous Games Festival in Polokwane and the Indigenous Games Competition in Tzaneen. The game is also supported by the Mpumalanga Department of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture and the Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture of the Province Gauteng, because it forms an important expression of indigenous identity and, as it was said, of a &quot;healthy life style&quot;. The best players, among them D. Shikwambam and Petrus Shibambu, are organized in Mindsports South Africa (MMSA).&#10;&#10;This renaissance of African games is a response to Thabo Mbeki's call &quot;to rediscover what was lost by indigenous people (of Africa through colonialism)&quot;.&#10;&#10;Today the towns of Sasekani and Bolobedu are centers of the game. Strong clubs are also in Ka-Phalaborwa, Letaba, and Selwane. The newspaper Mopani News reports reguarly on Moruba competitions. The game which is already taught in the Bolobedu High School, will soon be introduced in all schools of Limpopo Province. Dickson Mpofu, the indigenous games co-ordinator in Mpumalanga, even wants to register Moruba with the Olympic committee.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;The size of the game board often depends on the number of players. Most common are boards which have four rows of 12 holes (mekoti) each, but the number of holes can vary from four to 36 holes per row. The holes are dug into the earth. Each hole has two counters, usually pebbles or morula pips, which are called mathlapa (&quot;cattle&quot;) or tinkhomo (&quot;cow&quot;).&#10;&#10;The game is played by two persons and sometimes by teams of up to six.&#10;&#10;Each player (or team) only uses his side of the board.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two stones, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side.&#10;&#10;If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction.&#10;&#10;The move ends (kulala; literally &quot;to sleep&quot;) when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of his opponent contains stones, these enemy stones are &quot;killed&quot; (tlaba) or &quot;hit&quot;. Additionally, the stones in the hole of the same file in the outer row are &quot;captured&quot; (tlola). The killed or captured stones are removed from the board. The player is then entitled to capture the contents of any two other enemy holes.&#10;&#10;When a player has only singletons, he is permitted to move them, but only in empty holes.&#10;&#10;The player who has still stones at the end of the game is declared the winner. It is a draw, when the board position repeats without anything being captured. &quot;&#10;&#10;"

However, wooden boards are also carved.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;A board is used that consists of four rows, each one with eight holes.

After you have sown them, you take the ones in the next hole and keep on sowing with them.&#10;&#10;Your turn ends when you put the last piece of a sowing in a hole followed by an empty one.&#10;&#10;If the hole following the empty one is not empty, after a player has finished sowing, he captures its contents.&#10;&#10;The winner of a game is the one who captures more seeds.&#10;&#10;According to the description the game ends when &quot;all the pieces on the board are exhausted&quot;&#10;&#10;This is indeed possible, although it is a rather unusual ending. Humphries failed to explain what would happen if a player has no pieces to distribute, while his opponent has still pieces left in his holes.&#10;&#10;Similar games (e.g. Bay Khom, Walak-pussa) include the following rule:&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no legal move and the remaining pieces are captured by his adversary.&#10;&#10;The game was played in several rounds, in which holes could be captured, but the exact rules weren't given as &quot;by that time things began to get complicated and I was unable to discover how, if ever, the game ended&quot;.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

39608,,"A mancala game from Keren. From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Qelat_(Keren)&#10;&#10;&quot;Mancala variants are often played in the Keren-Agordat area of western Eritrea. Most players are herdsman taking their cattle to water, newly married couples and their friends, and housewives in their homes.&#10;&#10;Qelat is usually played in holes in the ground, but wooden boards are also known. The following game was observed by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 who called it Qelat II (Game 5). It might be related to Um el Banat (&quot;game of women&quot;), a mancala game to be found in northern Sudan.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Qelat is played on a two-row board with six playing holes per row called b&eacute;t in Bil&eacute;n (literally &quot;house&quot;) and two larger holes at the end of the board to store captured balls. Initially there are four balls in each b&eacute;t. The balls are called til in Bil&eacute;n, if they are dry goat droppings or shesher, if they are small stones.&#10;&#10;The balls are always sown one by one in an anti-clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;If the last ball falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last dropped ball are picked up and continued to be distributed into the following holes.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last seed falls into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;The players try to capture enemy holes by increasing their contents to four with the last sown ball in any hand. Captured holes are known as ekwarna, literally &quot;a child is born to me&quot;.&#10;&#10;A move may not start from an ekwarna with the result that balls would tend to accumulate in such holes. A player dropping the last ball in any hand into one of his own ekwarna might say lagadi yekura, literally &quot;grow up my children!&quot;.&#10;&#10;When the last ball falls into an ekwarna captured by his opponent he would &quot;eat&quot; (qunna in Bil&eacute;n) one of the counters in that hole, and put it, together with the ball effecting this capture, aside as his takings.&#10;&#10;A player's ownership of an ekwarna continues even if it becomes empty. Thus balls subsequently entering such a hole, belong to the player who had captured it, while his opponent on dropping the last counter of any lap there would put this counter aside as his takings.&#10;&#10;It is not permitted to pass as long as a player has a legal move.&#10;&#10;The round comes to an end when all the balls are captured either by being put aside or accumulated in ekwarna. The players then count out their total earnings by placing them back in their holes, four counters per hole. Pankhurst reported:&#10;&#10;&#10;        A player who had captured more than his original number of counters would gain one hole from his enemy for every four balls he captured. Should a player have won three extra counters his opponent, who had an extra counter, was obliged to cede to the player with tree who thus acquired an additional hole. If, on the other hand, the two players were each left at the end oft the round with two extra balls they would draw lots to decide to whom they should belong and who in consequence should gain the hole at issue. &#10;&#10;&#10;Eventually, the player who gains a monopoly of all the balls and hence of all twelve holes is declared winner.&#10;&#10;"

The Ijaw are with over 8 million people the fourth largest ethnic group of the country. Their armed militants, which form the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, are fighting against the destruction of the natural environment of the Niger delta by the petroleum industry.&#10;&#10;The game was first observed in the January of 1946 by K. C. Murray, the son of the famous English game historian Harold James Ruthven Murray (1868-1955). In Germany, Obridjie was mentioned in a game book in 1980. It was misspelled Obridjic in the description, while it was written correctly in the index of contents. Since then, the wrong spelling has been copied many times.&#10;&#10;Obridjie is very similar to other Nigerian mancala games, such as Whyo (Oron clan, Ibibio), Jerin (Yoruba) and Lok (Jaba). It is a simple game which is preferred by women. A similar game is known by the Anuak at the Ethiopian-Sudanese border as Anywoli.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;&quot;The game board consists of 2x6 smaller holes and a store hole at each end. Initially there are four seeds in each of the smaller holes. A player owns the row closest to him and the store to his right.&#10;&#10;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his smaller holes and distributes it, one by one, counterclockwise into the following holes, but not in the stores. If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last distributed seed is continued to be distributed.&#10;&#10;If at any time during a turn a hole contains four seeds, its contents are captured by the player who owns this hole. The captured stones are immediately put into the player's store.&#10;&#10;Exception: If the last seed of a lap makes a four, these seeds are captured by the player who was moving, no matter where the hole is.&#10;&#10;A move ends when the last seed is dropped into an empty hole or makes a four.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the players can't move.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player who captured most seeds.

Sometimes it is also played in the open as well. However, the game is usually not played at night. Play often continues for several hours and the players may be surrounded by many spectators who &quot;observe, assist and enthuse&quot; them.&#10;&#10;The game was first described by Dr L. S. Saraswathi in 1995.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a two rows board. Each row has seven holes.&#10;&#10;According to Saraswathi every hole usually contains five seeds at the beginning, although six may be used, too.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the seeds from one of his holes in a clockwise direction into the following holes. When all seeds have been sown, the contents of the next hole are picked up and distributed in another lap.&#10;&#10;The turn ends when the last seed falls into a hole which is succeeded by an empty one.&#10;&#10;During sowing the contents of any hole that contains exactly four (pasu) seeds are immediately captured by the player who owns the hole.&#10;&#10;If, after the turn was finished, the hole following the empty one is occupied, the contents of this hole are captured.

In the next game, the players fill their holes with the seeds they captured in the previous game. Again, there must be five seeds per hole. These holes which cannot be filled are closed.

It is a Go, Weiqi, or Baduk variant. The Sz'Kwa board is not an n x n square board like Go or Weiqi. Instead, the board is circular in design. The same board is used by Watermelon Chess and one of the ancient Roman Bear games.&#10;Contents&#10;[hide]&#10;&bull;    1 Goal &#10;&bull;    2 Equipment &#10;&bull;    3 Game Play and Rules &#10;&bull;    4 Related Games &#10;&bull;    5 External Links&#10;&#10;[edit] Goal&#10;To capture the most enemy pieces.&#10;[edit] Equipment&#10;The board is composed of a large circle with an inner middle circle. Four semi-circles form a North, South, East, and West arrangement in the interior of the larger circle. The large circle and the smaller middle circle are divided equally into four pie slices. This creates for twenty-one intersection points where the pieces are played upon.&#10;Each player has 20 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will do.&#10;[edit] Game Play and Rules&#10;1. The board is empty in the beginning.&#10;2. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.&#10;3. Players drop one of their pieces on any vacant intersection point on the board. Only one piece can be dropped per turn. Players alternate their turns.&#10;4. Enemy piece(s) can be captured as long as the enemy piece(s) are surrounded completely by the player's pieces.&#10;5. The game ends when there are no more vacant intersection points to drop a piece onto, or when one player has exhausted all their pieces.&#10;[edit] Related Games&#10;Go, Weiqi, Baduk, Watermelon Chess, Bear games&#10;[edit] External Links&#10;http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1196&#10;http://totmon.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=285&#10;Retrieved from &quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sz%27Kwa&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;"

39616,,"A manqala game. From http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Tchadji:&#10;&#10;Tchadji is a game played, at least, in Island of Mozambique (Ilha de Mo&ccedil;ambique in Portuguese, the official language; Muhipitti in Makua, the local language). It has been studied by Abdulcarimo Ismael, a mathematician from Universidade Pedag&oacute;gica, Maputo. It is played mostly by men. &#10;Except for the initial position, and for the fixed length of the board, tchadji is identical to mefuvha and moruba.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Tchadji is played in a wooden board with four rows of eight holes each. At the beginning there are 2 seeds (Caesalpinia bonduc) per hole. Each player only uses his side of the board, which consists of two rows. &#10;At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his holes, which must contain at least two seeds, and distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into consecutive holes on his own side. &#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap in the same direction, and so on. &#10;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. &#10;If the last seed is put into an empty hole of the inner row and the opposite hole of the opponent contains seeds, these enemy seeds are &quot;eaten&quot; (odj&aacute;). &#10;Additionally, the seeds of the outer hole directly behind it, if any, are also eaten and the contents of another (any) enemy hole. The eaten seeds of the opponent are removed from the board. &#10;When a player has only singletons (ompwech&aacute;, &quot;divided into pieces&quot;), he is permitted to move them, but only into empty holes. &#10;The winner is the one who captures all the opponent's seeds. &#10;Other data&#10;Talking about habitual players, the first move is made without counting, as they know beforehand what are the best moves. Usually the first move is made from the last but one hole in the outter row (the second from the right). On next moves players do count. &#10;According to the study made by Ismael, a game lasts a mean of 146 seconds, and 38 moves per player. The shortest (in time) recorded game lasted 62 seconds. The shortest in moves, 16. The longest, 4 minutes 39 seconds and 73 moves respectively.&quot;&#10;&#10;"
