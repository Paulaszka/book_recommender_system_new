Players are members of the fire brigade. Their goal is to save citizens by rescuing and transporting them from endangered areas to the hospital. At the same time, they want to prevent buildings from burning down and keep the fire contained by preventing the spread of a raging inferno. This game can be played in two modes. In Normal Mode players try to save as many citizens as they can, while in Expert Mode they must save all of the citizens or they lose the game.&#10;&#10;The board consists of hexes with different areas (grass, forest, wetlands etc.) with drier areas having more chances to catch on fire. Buildings, Citizens and Fire Tokens are placed on the board according to the chosen scenario. There are nine scenarios for different number of players and difficulties.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a Squad Card along with the matching Fire Truck Miniature and Starting Hex and is assigned one random Firefighting Ability Card and one random Utility Ability Card. That gives each Squad unique abilities to achieve the given goals easier.&#10;&#10;The game has multiple rounds, each following the same procedure. Each round is divided into three phases: Fire-spreading Phase, Event Phase and Players&rsquo; Actions Phase.&#10;&#10;In the Fire-spreading Phase the first player rolls the two Fire Dice. The sum of both numbers determines which hexes will be additionally affected by fire this turn. The fire intensifies and spreads according to the dice roll. If the fire intensifies too much, the Fire Tokens are replaced with an Inferno Token. Buildings on those hexes have burned to the ground and the Citizens are lost.&#10;&#10;Then comes the Event Phase which changes the situation on the board. Events can be positive, negative or both.  There is an interesting fact about firemen and fire at the bottom of each event card.&#10;&#10;The last phase is the Players&rsquo; Actions Phase. When it is their turn, each player can perform any combination of three basic actions (i.e. has three action points) and any number of free actions. The basic actions are: move Fire truck, extinguish fire, use Firefighting ability, use Utility ability, repair the Fire Truck, and evacuate Citizens. The free actions are: drop off Citizens in the Hospital and get Motivation Card, use Motivation card, drop off Citizens temporarily and pick them up after being dropped off. Players can pass at any point of their turn.&#10;&#10;At the End of the game, players can check how well they did. Points are awarded based on how well the fire was contained and how many buildings were burned down. The score is then compared to the Score table which places players in categories from one to five stars, with stars being lost for every lost Citizen. By calculating their score, the players see how well they did and take a scenario with higher or lower difficulty, or try to beat their score in the same scenario next time.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

There were great feasts and opulent amusements, conspicuous expressions of deepest and sincerest piety, and fierce tournaments. Each King outshone the other in turn, so that the world might be astounded at the wealth and power of each kingdom. So many tents and raiments were made of precious cloth of gold, that the field is so named.&#10;&#10;This game was created to commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of the world&rsquo;s most famous three-week  party, in which King Henry VIII of England, and Francis I of France, spent ridiculous amounts of money and resources to peacock at each other. Through smiles made of gritted teeth, the game&rsquo;s two players will express friendship: each action they take will give their opponent a tile that they might use to score. Scoring usually entails removing the tile from the game, so each player must take care to maximize their scoring opportunities while either denying them to their rival, or forcing their rival to score before they&rsquo;re ready. Once the game is underway, players are generally given only two options, and both of those options are usually painful - even and sometimes especially when they score you points.&#10;&#10;A sort of subversion of the point salad paradigm, The Field of the Cloth of Gold harkens back to the feel of the classic German games of the 1990s: simple, elegant, austere, and politely vicious.&#10;&#10;The second edition of the game, dubbed the &quot;503rd anniversary edition&quot;, includes a new jewel tile type.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Can you lead your country to an age of happiness and prosperity?&#10;&#10;REACTOR is a light, quick playing civilization building strategy game commissioned by NSquare and designed for use in the classroom to create teachable moments highlighting the dangers of nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each turn consists of 3 phases in this order: Infrastructure, Action, and Aftermath&#10;&#10;Infrastructure Phase&#10;Starting with the first player, everyone chooses one category to raise up 2 levels.&#10;&#10;Action Phase&#10;Each player secretly chooses which action they will take by playing the corresponding card face down in front of themselves. There are 5 possible actions. Economic Progress: Add resources to any category. Global Responsibility: Create an alliance and/or generate resources. Human Achievement: Add resources to your lowest category. Satisfaction: Convert military resources to any other category and get bonus resources. Military: Invade or Nuke another nation. All actions are explained in greater detail below.&#10;&#10;Once all players have locked in a choice, the cards are revealed, and the actions are resolved starting with the first player.&#10;&#10;Aftermath Phase&#10;Players with an active alliance automatically produce additional resources which can be placed anywhere. Allied players receive 1 resource per alliance at level 2, 2 resources per alliance at level 5, and 3 resources per alliance at level 10.&#10;&#10;Then the first player marker is moved clockwise from the current first player and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;End&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, any nations with a total score of 30 or more points from all categories, except Military, (or with a Satisfaction level of 8+ and total score of 25 or more points) are considered winners unless all remaining nations have winning totals in which case the player with the lowest Satisfaction score loses. If players have a tie for lowest Satisfaction score then break that tie with their point total from the other three categories.&#10;&#10;If all nations have been Nuked, then everyone loses.&#10;&#10;If only 1 Nation remains, that nation is technically &ldquo;the winner&rdquo; but they are now the sole survivors of a nuclear wasteland.&#10;&#10;Among younger demographics, the nuclear issue is abstract and distant&mdash;a problem of previous generations. There are more resonant issues like social injustice, global warming, or economy disparity that, while still daunting, are far more comprehensible and consequential.&#10;Reactor, engages high school students in the classroom about the nuclear weapons threat by connecting this issue to more visible social matters through an interactive and accessible medium. By breaking down the complexity of this problem with play, students cultivate a sense of understanding that drives engagement, helping foster new generations that feel empowered and responsible to take action.&#10;&#10;About NSquare: &#10;In 2014, five of the largest peace and security funders in the United States joined forces to develop a new, collective approach to incentivizing and rewarding innovation in the nuclear threat field. What emerged was N Square, a path-breaking initiative built on the idea that new forms of cross-sector collaboration&mdash;combined with the sheer ingenuity of an engaged public&shy;&mdash;will accelerate the achievement of internationally agreed goals to reduce nuclear dangers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Casualties on both sides numbered in the hundreds of thousands and both sides had resorted to chemical weapons, missile attacks against their opponent&rsquo;s cities, and an escalating air and sea campaign in the Persian Gulf that threatened to bring Super power intervention. The Iranian government felt that an offensive to take the crucial city of Basra, Iraq&rsquo;s only port and primary gateway for shipping out its oil and receiving goods from abroad, could end the war with a victory. Dubbed &ldquo;Karbala 5&rdquo; the Iranians amassed much of their Revolutionary Guard formations supported by new weapons secretly purchased from the &ldquo;Great Satan&rdquo; USA (via the illegal Iran-Contra affair) as well as North Korea. A feint attack north of the battlefield, Karbala 6, by much of the Iranian armored force would tie up Iraq&rsquo;s reserves. The resulting battle for Basra was one of the largest and bloodiest battles fought in the war, with both sides fighting with all they had. In the end the battle for Basra would prove just as indecisive as the larger war, with neither side able to claim a clear victory.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

Aware of what fate has reserved for Violet, and opposing such nonsense as trolls befriending humans, he will do all in his power, to prevent Violet from meeting this troll.&#10;&#10;The Grumpy Nisse, is a 2-player card game where one player is Violet and the other is Torech. Torech tries to prevent Violet from reaching the end of the forest before sunrise, in which case he will win the game. Players will play out one card each and compare their strengths to determine who wins the round, if Violet, then she will progress, otherwise she'll have to try again. Some of the spots in the forest will trigger events that can make the game harder for either one or the other player, so players need to be careful in how they play out their cards.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players will draft cards to build the decks that they will play with for the duration of the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The game is over when all living players return to their ship in the northwest with the treasure OR the Thief escapes to their ship in the northeast with the treasure.&#10;&#10;In order to find the treasure, players must gather resources from the island to craft various items. These items are either useful tools in order to help them survive or the altars which are needed to located the treasure. Once all four alters are built and have been lit, the location of the treasure is revealed. Players must do all of this while not only surviving the dangers of the island, but also avoiding the Thief.&#10;&#10;The Thief will hunt your players throughout the entire game; always trying to steal resources and deal damage to any player they cross paths with. Once the Treasure has been revealed, the Thief will only engage the player that is in possession of it. During this period of the game, the Thief will ignore other players in an attempt to get to the treasure. If the Thief manages to steal the treasure and get back to their ship the game is over.&#10;&#10;"

Played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system, Reactor is a high-speed battle that takes advantage of the distributed intelligence of Blinks pieces to create a constantly shifting gameboard and dynamic difficulty levels. Originally created at the Global Game Jam 2020, Reactor takes inspiration from competitive fighting games, and distills them down to an intense contest of reflexes and concentration.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;Arrange your Blinks so that each player has a single-file pathway to the center Blink. If possible, each player&rsquo;s path should be the same length. When you are finished setting up, long-press the center Blink to start the Reactor.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;The center Reactor will continuously flash colors. If it flashes the same color twice in a row, players must press the Blink at the end of their path to &ldquo;buzz in.&rdquo; The order in which the players buzz in will be shown by the color of their path. The first player to buzz in becomes green, the last player becomes red, and all others become yellow. Any player that does not buzz in is considered &ldquo;last&rdquo; and also displays red.&#10;&#10;After results are shown, any player with a red path must remove the last piece on their branch and set it on the table in reach of all other players. This piece is now &ldquo;unstable,&rdquo; and displays a spinning yellow pattern.&#10;&#10;All players, in addition to watching the Reactor, must now keep their eyes on these unstable Blinks. When an unstable Blink erupts in a green display, any player can grab it off the table and add it to the end of their chain. If the Blink flashes red instead, it is permanently out of the game.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION:&#10;The game continues until all players but one have lost all the Blinks in their pathway.&#10;&#10;PAY UP VARIANT&#10;Reactor can also be played with a set of &ldquo;Pay Up&rdquo; rules. In this version, players who display red after buzzing in, either because they buzzed last or didn&rsquo;t buzz at all, must give their end pieces to the green player instead of setting them aside. Because players &ldquo;Pay Up&rdquo; after each round, there are no unstable Blinks on the table.&#10;&#10;This version of the game is more focused than the standard rules, and two evenly-matched players can battle it out for a very long time.&#10;&#10;"

By 1482, the unfortunate town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, once the richest port town in Scotland, had changed hands thirteen times. By the time Henry VIII ascended the throne of England in 1509, the fifty-mile-wide stretch of rolling hills and stunning vistas that straddle the border had seen decades of hardship and atrocity.&#10;&#10;Yet still the hardy families living on these frontier lands persevered. Unable to count on crops surviving until the harvest, they subsisted primarily on the livestock they could shepherd in the fields near their homesteads. When supplies ran low, raiding to steal what they needed from their neighbors was often the answer. Raids were often carefully planned operations with several border families uniting to steal livestock from a common foe in the dead of night. Cattle and sheep were the likely targets, often with hundreds of these creatures being stolen in a single raid. The reiver&rsquo;s goal was to herd their quarry to safety before the retaliatory &ldquo;hot trod&rdquo; pursuit could catch up and force an engagement.&#10;&#10;To combat this constant hostility, England and Scotland established the system of March Law. Each nation divided its border lands into an East, Middle, and West March with each of these six territories administered by a Warden responsible for keeping the peace. The Wardens were drawn from the most powerful families on the Borders, clans of great renown that could put upwards of a thousand men in the saddle in times of need. The March Law would have succeeded too, but for the fact that these same great families were usually the ones best equipped and most inclined to raid their neighbors.&#10;&#10;In Border Reivers, each player rules over one of the Marches as leader of one of the six major riding families of the border: Grey, Fenwick, Dacre, Maxwell, Kerr, or Hume. Your goal is to increase the wealth and fame of your clan throughout the reigns of Henry and Elizabeth to end the century as the most famous Border Reiver of all time. Players gain VPs from successful combats, amassing large herds of livestock, and by elevating their Notoriety above the other players in the regions of the map.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Grab a boost or chevron and watch out for oil. After moving, you steer by rotating a quadrant of the board, which rearranges the paths and can force your opponents to head in different directions.&#10;&#10;This comes with 4 two-sided cards and a rule sheet.

In the game are four suits: peace, love, unity, and respect.  Players try to use these cards to collect sets in the score area to win the game.  But, at the beginning of each player's turn, a villain card pops out and makes the player discards all cards of a suit that the villain supresses.  Instead of fighting the villains, the players must sway them by giving them cards from their deck.  If the player does not have enough, the villain stays in play.  As the villains stack up, the players must discard more and more cards from their hand.  If the villains ever supress all four suits, peace, love, unity, and respect, then no one has any cards and the villains win the game!&#10;&#10;Fight the power!  Join the resistance!
