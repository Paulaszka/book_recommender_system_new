It is divided into six big kingdoms, each carrying its own history, culture, and mysteries. The world has survived a great calamity that struck the land eighty years ago. Ever since things have changed and the continent has seen a sudden spike of creatures old and new that plague the land and are troubling the local populace.

You travel the land in search of missions that will, if successfully completed, grant you rewards in the form of coins.

You play as a unique character with your own character traits including a minor, major and super combo. You'll need them to fight off the zombies move closer to you every round. You run from location to location, searching for weapons and survivors in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. You'll also need them along if you want to win as every survivor provides you victory points.&#10;&#10;This streamlined version removes several decks from the original game, including the Fleeing deck and Event deck. Players rolls six dice instead of five and there are now different combos to mitigate against tough zombie-filled rolls. Additionally, players can now use followers to soak damage coming in from zombies.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player dies, the Town Line comes out of the locations deck, or when the Mutant Zombie has been put down once and for all.

A long and bloody siege affair.&#10;&#10;&quot;Storm Over Madrid&quot; uses a modified version of the well-known area-impulse wargame system. The modifications to the original system are many and carefully considered. Besides a new morale points system that highlights the intrinsic febrility of the Republican side, support points that oblige players to plan ahead and event chits, our combat system has several new concepts: defensive fire and counter-attacks, automatic losses depending on the intensity of the battle... Attacks are never free and the actual decision to attack must be thought through carefully.&#10;&#10;One game turn represents a week and the game runs from 9 October 1936 to 21 January 1937 (15 turns). 2 short scenarios and a campaign game allow you to play the battle from start to finish, with each scenario requiring a different style of play.&#10;Units are for the most part battalion strength.   The Nationalists have the (Spanish) Legion and Moroccan troops, while on the Republican side there are anarchists, communists and the International Brigades.&#10;&#10;An interesting 2 player wargame, one that is fun to play and historically correct.  It&rsquo;s a game that allows you to understand the ins and outs of this asymmetric siege by revisiting a game system that has already proved its worth.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

A handful of Arch-Mages are vying for the loyalty of wizards across the land so that they can wield ultimate power.&#10;&#10;Lizard Wizard is a game from the team that brought you Raccoon Tycoon.  Aspects of gameplay will be familiar to fans of RT, and will add a bit of extra depth and strategy.&#10;&#10;In Lizard Wizard, players compete to recruit wizards from seven unique schools of magic, build mystical towers, research powerful spells, summon helpful familiars, and search dark dungeons for gold and items of power. Only one Arch-Mage will rise above the rest and control the land. Will it be you?&#10;&#10; &#10;Actions&#10; Lizard Wizard is an action-selection game. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they may perform one of the following six Actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;1)    GATHER REAGENTS&#10;Just as there are seven schools of magic, there are seven magical reagents, or ingredients, that fuel the magic of Astoria. Knowing where these natural wonders can be found is the essential starting point for every young wizard. Sometimes they use familiars to perform this errand, but it is still very common to find even the most powerful arch-mages lurking in the Enchanted Wood, searching for the most pure reagents.&#10;&#10;     Play a Gather Reagents Card&#10;     Take Reagents shown on the &lsquo;Gather Reagents&rsquo; half (plus any on your Wizard Cards)&#10;     Increase the value of the Reagents shown on the &lsquo;Increase Value&rsquo; half&#10;     Cast one spell (if you have the necessary reagents)&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;2)    CONVERT REAGENTS TO MANA&#10;Long ago, the wizards of Astoria learned how to convert reagents into mana, the magical energy that powers all things. The process is no longer dangerous, but it still takes great focus and knowledge.&#10;&#10;     Turn in one type of reagents to the supply&#10;     Gain Mana = Value of that Reagent x Tokens turned in&#10;     Reduce the Value of that Reagent by the number of Tokens turned in&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;3)    RECRUIT WIZARD&#10;The Arch Mages of Astoria are vying for ultimate power, which can only be achieved by drawing several lesser wizards into their circle of influence. They do this through demonstrations of their magical ability. Occasionally, their attempts to recruit a wizard are challenged by one or more rivals, and a Wizard&rsquo;s Duel occurs. These contests of magical power can drain even the most powerful mage.&#10;&#10;     Select one of the two Wizard Cards on offer and bid Mana in turn (or pass)&#10;     Winner of the Auction pays the bid and takes the Wizard Card&#10;     If the player who started the Auction didn&rsquo;t win, they may take another Action&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;4)    RESEARCH SPELL &#10;Arch-Mages have the ability to learn spells from any of the seven schools of magic. Once they have researched a new spell, it still must be cast with reagents (and the help of a familiar) before it takes effect.&#10;&#10;     Select a Spell Card from the four on offer and pay 5 Mana&#10;     Place the Spell Card face down in front of you&#10;     Cast the Spell if you have the necessary Reagents&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;5)    CREATE A TOWER &#10;Magical Towers amplify the power of wizards of each school of magic. Towers may be created through powerful magic, or built by workers who must be paid.&#10;&#10;     Pay either the Reagents or the Gold shown on the Tower Card on offer&#10;     Take the Tower Card and place it in front of you&#10;     Towers add &lsquo;1&rsquo; to your storage for Reagents&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;6)    SUMMON FAMILIAR: &#10;Familiars are magical spirits that are summoned and inhabit the bodies of mortal creatures. They are essential servants who perform many vital services for wizards: They can be used for simple errands, such as gathering reagents or gold. They are the only ones who can locate the ever-shifting entrance to the famous Dungeons of Astoria. They are also essential assistants in the complex rituals required to cast spells.&#10;Use the Card for one of four purposes:&#10;    a) Score one School of Magic (2 Gold/ Card of the same School of Magic as the Familiar)&#10;    b) Gather Reagents shown on the Familiar Card and Cast any number of Spells &#10;    c) Clear the Spell Offer, Replace them with four new Spell Cards and select one for free&#10;    d) Enter the Dungeon&#10;&#10;     Draw cards from the top of the Dungeon Deck, stopping when you want&#10;     Monster Cards &lsquo;hit&rsquo;; 2 hits = failure&#10;     If you stop before failure, keep the treasure cards and shuffle the monster cards back into the Dungeon Deck&#10;     If you fail, shuffle all drawn cards back into the Dungeon Deck&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;End Game and Scoring&#10;&#10;The game will end when any one of the following decks is depleted: Familiar, Tower, Wizard, Spell.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, the players will score points for each Wizard and Tower Card combo (10 VP if they are of the same school of magic, and 5 VP if they are not), 3 VP for each Spell Card in schools of magic where they have a matching Wizard and Tower, 1 VP for each Gold gathered from the dungeon or from scoring with a Familiar Card, and any points derived from the special abilities from spells.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Use a piece's special abilities - like Memory that swaps places with another piece, Time that can move an opposing piece backward, Peripherals that can circle the sides of the board, or Shadows that reach far and capture everything - and you risk revealing your strategy.  In Quin, your choices, and how well you know your rival, are what determine your fate.&#10;&#10;The magnetic Quin board is based on a traditional grid, if you can imagine that grid warped into a circle by a black hole.  As such it is made of 5 Sight Lines, crossing the board at the center, 8 gold Rings, a Horizon Line, and the Iris.  The Iris is just 2 spaces around the center, where most pieces have to pass if they want to get to the other side, and it is a neutral zone, where powers don't work.

Villages score only if you have more pairs of reception and GPS tiles than the number of villages, while the reception and GPS pairs net you no points, but allow you to get a tile from the pool of &quot;known information&quot;. Equipment makes it safe to explore volcanoes on the island, and if you don't have enough equipment, you might lose other tiles you've collected.&#10;&#10;Sumatra also includes badges that players can collect. Be the first to collect, say, three flora tiles or a combination of two inhabitant and two craft tiles, and you can claim the badge for this, which is worth 3 points at game's end. You can also claim one diversity badge for having at least one tile in at least six rows of your notebook. The more rows you have a presence in, the higher the value of the diversity badge, but you can claim at most one during the game &mdash; and if someone else claims the six-row badge, then you'll need to have a tile in at least seven rows for the next one...&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&Uacute;nete a esta expedici&oacute;n y descubre Sumatra desde la cima de sus majestuosos volcanes hasta las profundidades de su selva. Encuentra los animales m&aacute;s ex&oacute;ticos, las flores m&aacute;s exuberantes y conoce la interminable variedad de culturas que conviven en la isla m&aacute;s grande de Indonesia. La expedici&oacute;n parte con la misi&oacute;n de escribir un cuaderno de viaje que ayude a dar a conocer uno de los ecosistemas m&aacute;s ricos del mundo. Aquel que contribuya en mayor medida a esta apasionante misi&oacute;n se alzar&aacute; con la victoria.&#10;&#10;En Sumatra, los jugadores se ir&aacute;n desplazando por la isla para explorar sus m&uacute;ltiples parajes. En cada uno de ellos encontrar&aacute;n informaci&oacute;n &uacute;til, representada por losetas, que deber&aacute;n registrar en sus cuadernos de viaje coloc&aacute;ndolas en su fila correspondiente.

You, the royal messenger, must return to the palace and deliver the urgent message you've received from the scouts as quickly as possible.&#10;Fail to deliver your message in time - and the palace will come under attack before the High King's armies have been mustered!&#10;&#10;Quick as you are, this challenge may be too hard even for you, messenger. The palace is far away, and it'd normally take you seven days to cover the distance. Now, you only have five. What's more, the roads have become much more dangerous of late. Nevertheless, set out you must, if the High King is to receive the warning in time!&#10;&#10;Your goal is to return to the palace and deliver your message in five days or less. Along the way, you will face several challenges and come across several people and animals. Each day will present a new challenge or encounter. While some will hinder you, others will help you make it to the palace in time.&#10;&#10;Your base speed is 40 miles per day, and the royal palace is 280 miles away from your starting point. You won't make it in time unless you somehow manage to increase your speed. Perhaps something or someone along the way will help make you faster...&#10;&#10;Each time you play, you will draw up to five cards - one card each turn - and face at least three different challenges. It is up to you to decide whether you take on the encounter of the day or avoid it. While some encounters can be automatically avoided, others require you to successfully hide in order to avoid them, and some encounters simply cannot be avoided. You must take on at least three of the encounters you come across (including those which cannot be avoided).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The Quick-start Guide&rsquo;s comic book style throws readers back to the 1970s, providing vital insight into the core rules of the game while embracing the fun of a cosmic conquest filled with wacky aliens and outrageous abilities. What's more, with the beautiful translucent ship pieces (as shown above), spreading your colonies across the galaxy has never been more stylish!&#10;&#10;A newly discovered species joins the classic line-up of aliens. You can, of course, play as old favorites such as Mite or Remora, or you can try your hand at leading the ruthless Demon to victory. Previously only released at Cosmic Con, this species was exiled from their original galaxy for unprincipled opportunism. Now they seek cosmic vengeance, using their power to possess other players&rsquo; hands to bolster their own strength and sap others&rsquo; will to win.&#10;&#10;In addition to this monstrous newcomer, Cosmic Encounter 42nd Anniversary Edition offers you new ways to customize your games with the introduction of Cosmic Combo cards. These carefully assembled cards offer a list of alien species with a brief description of their powers to create themed matchups and explore different types of games. You may find yourself among some Big Time Clubbers or Cellar Dwellers, that can be integrated into three, four, or five-player games. Every card spins a new challenge, and with these new options for customization, no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
