Japanese players can enjoy the text, but it is not necessary for gameplay.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#169;&#149;&#232;&#171;&#150;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#169;&#149;&#228;&#190;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#139;&#172;&#229;&#141;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;16&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;4&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#169;&#149;&#228;&#190;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#232;&#166;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Each party begins by choosing Presidential and VP home states (with local and regional benefits) and political philosophy (Conservative, Liberal or Moderate).&#10;&#10;Each campaign week starts with an Event card that combines a random bonus/penalty event with a political statement or proposal. Candidates get penalties and bonuses depending on the stand they support. For instance, supporting a Southern Senator's controversial statement adds 3 regional points in the South but costs 1 in other regions and 2 in each Liberal state; denouncing has an opposite effect.&#10;&#10;Each week has six campaign days. On each day, the candidate can make a personal appearance in any one state, adding 5 points in that state, sometimes modified by that day's Crisis card. Each party also has a limited number of media campaigns that can be targeted locally (+8), regionally (+3) or nationally (+1). Point counters are used to show net advantage in each state and in boxes for regions, economic interests, political philosophy and the nation as a whole, while the party advantages in each state are marked on the board.&#10;&#10;The game runs for 9 weeks plus the Monday before Election Day. On election day, the result for each state is determined by tallying each party's net advantage in national, regional and local support, economic interest, political philosophy and party advantage, modified by a final -2 to +2 die roll by each party. The party with the highest net wins that state's electoral college votes, and 270 EC votes wins the election. An EC vote tie is broken by number of states won, with the District of Columbia being the final tie-breaker.&#10;&#10;"

When rolling dice to attack another miniature, the result also determines the amount of damage for a successful attack.&#10;&#10;Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) released the original Bladestorm in 1990, together with it&rsquo;s own fantastic setting on the continent of Folenn.

Cretacea is inspired mainly by the great dinosaur documentaries of the late 90&rsquo;s.&#10;&#10;This short gaming rule set will allow you to grab some dinosaurs, terrain and be gaming in no time. Cretacea is designed to be used with 1/100th scale dinosaurs (roughly similar to 10mm regimental scale) but you could use any dinosaur toy or model as long as their scale is relative to each other. Bases of the dinosaurs should not exceed their physical dimensions to any particular extent and they should be based individually, even small and tiny dinosaurs. Tokens have been included in this set for every dino listed! Each game lasts about 30-45 minutes and is more about acting on your opportunities than being overly tactical in this way the game often keeps you on your toes&#10;&#10;"

211122,,Emily Is Probably Dead By Now&#10;A sinister game of bluffing and collusion for 4-6 players.&#10;&#10;Gameplay begins with all players guilty of murdering Emily and hiding the body.&#10;Everyone at the table is guilty and is looking for a way out.&#10;Each player begins with pieces of evidence that they must stash in order to get away with murder and win the game leaving the other players to waste away behind bars.&#10;&#10;During each round of the game players will play location cards face down claiming that they are helping the town search party look for the &quot;missing&quot; Emily. The rest of the group needs to decide if you are actually checking a location or trying to stash evidence when nobody is looking.&#10;&#10;If you get caught hiding evidence you will gain suspicion which will make it more difficult to get rid of your current evidence and if you are caught trying to collude with other players you will gain additional pieces of evidence.&#10;&#10;Ok.....so get rid of evidence that's it right? It can't get much worse then committing a murder and having evidence on you as you help search for the missing person. Well that is true until one unlucky player ends up actually picking up Emily and must now get rid of this very damming piece of evidence .&#10;If any player is caught with Emily's body the game immediately ends and that player will receive the death penalty while all other players will serve jail sentences based on how much evidence they currently have in their hand.&#10;&#10;Game Highlights&#10;&#10;Bluffing&#10;Bluffing and hiding your true intentions is the heart and sole of this game. The mechanics were developed to not get in the way or hinder your ability to bluff your way through a tough situation. There are situations in the game that will test your metal and challenge your ability to maintain a convincing deception.&#10;&#10;Collusion&#10;Players will have opportunities on the fly to quickly decide to work with each other to get further in the game but beware there can only be one winner and colluding with others carries a much higher penalty and invites a firm back-stab from savvy players looking to catch you off guard.&#10;&#10;Quick Game Play&#10;Emily Is Probably Dead is very quick to learn and each game takes about 20-30 mins to conclude. Making this a perfect filler game to play in between other games or as a quick fun gaming experience with very little time commitment.&#10;&#10;A New Twist On the Who Dunnit Theme&#10;&quot;So who dunnit?&quot;......&quot;You all did!&quot; now its a question of who is going to get caught and who is going to get away with murder!&#10;&#10;
