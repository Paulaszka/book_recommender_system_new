The objective is to score more morale points than your opponent. Historically the bombing inflicted little real damage on British cities in general or industry in particular. The attacks' psychological impact, however, was enormous: the campaign demonstrated Britain was vulnerable to outside invaders for the first time in a millennium. Victory is therefore determined based on the German player's ability to panic the British populace.&#10;&#10;Each air unit represents a flight or squadron of aircraft. Each hexagon represents five miles from side to opposite side. Each &quot;operational turn&quot; represents one month. Each &quot;flying turn&quot; represents 20 minutes of flying time.&#10;&#10;1BoB has three scenarios. Scenario 1 covers the situation in 1917, with both sides racing to build up their airpower. Scenario 2 covers 1918, with both sides at full strength. Scenario 3 covers the entire campaign from 1917 through 1918. Players who want to get right into a head-to-head contest of strength in the skies over England are advised to begin with Scenario 2. Experienced players will need about four hours to finish one of the yearly scenarios, while the campaign game will take about eight hours to finish.&#10;&#10;Units include bombers and fighters, both carrier and land based, as well as Zeppelins, Royal Navy seaplane tenders and aircraft carriers, anti-aircraft artillery, aerodromes, civil defense and early warning. German formations and aircraft types included in the large-size iconic counter-mix (176 total), by famed artist Larry Hoffman, include the following: Albatross D-I, Fokker D-VII and Pfalz D-III fighters; the elite &quot;England&quot; and &quot;Kagohl 3&quot; bomber squadrons; along with plenty of Gotha and Riesen bombers. On the British side there are: Avro 504, Be-2, Be-12, Fe-2, Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Pup and Se5A fighters; along with DH-4, Handley Page and Strutter bombers. All planes are rated for air-to-air combat, pursuit, bombardment and speed.&#10;&#10;"

It is designed to be facilitated by a trainer or consultant interested in generating discussions about the organizational culture and framed around desired outcomes. It comes with extensive debriefing ideas. It is a business simulation but useful for schools and other organizations looking to improve collaboration.&#10;&#10;It is normally played with 5 / 6 people on a team, with 3 to a 100+ teams. It can play with as few as 6 people but the design works much better with 12 or more.

The reality is that teams often choose to compete, thus making choices that sub-optimize results.&#10;&#10;Components include a colorful map, a Grub Stake of resource cards, planning tools, job aids and other information about the game and the goals. Putting on cowboy hats and bandannas, the group settles in to briefly hear the history of the Lost Dutchman's Mine and to learn the mechanics of the challenge.&#10;&#10;The team is given 20 days of 2 minutes each to manage their journey to the mine and back home to Apache Junction. They can choose from 3 paths with different risks, planning for weather changes and focusing on the optimal use of resources. Teams are given the opportunity to gain additional information valuable to their journey's success but must decide if they are willing to delay their start by one or two days in order to obtain this information. After being given the introductory information, the team has 15 minutes to plan. They must work together to make decisions about tactics, resource management, direction and risk.&#10;&#10;The 20 days of play (roughly 35 minutes) begin and are marked by lots of lively interaction among players and teams in the spirit of collaboration and competition. During this time, they'll discover the impact of their early decisions on their results. They can choose to get advice or collaborate with others.&#10;&#10;The goal is to get to the mine, mine as much gold as WE can, and return to Apache Junction. All teams are successful, but the ones that plan and collaborate will optimize their results. Debriefing can focus on collaboration, planning, leadership, motivation, optimization of organizational performance results and many other themes.&#10;&#10;"
