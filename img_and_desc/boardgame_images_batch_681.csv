As you progress in telling the path you took, hour by hour other players will have a chance to interrupt, and change the sequence of events in their favor.  There is a lot of storytelling fun to be had and of course an incredible amount of strategy in what information you reveal or keep hidden from other players.&#10;&#10;In the game, players will plot out their movement from area to area strategizing on what type of 'catch' they want to collect. If no one contests, they have first pick.  As the story progresses, other players will jump in to alter the events provided that they were in the location at or before the current player.  These interruptions allow the other players to sneak in and grab 'catches' that they want.  At the end of the game, players will total their catches and declare a winner!&#10;&#10;"

Designed for two to four players, the game pits two ancient beings of great power against one another to determine which of their lineage are strongest. The players use sorcery to conjure minions, cast spells, and wield enchanted items to reach the game's goal of conquering three battlefields.&#10;&#10;The game uses a simple resource system of &quot;energy&quot; that is determined randomly by a dice-roll at the beginning of each round, to make sure no round is the same. However, the outcome being the same for both players, the game balance stays even. This energy is then used in the Action Phase for conjuring minions from your hand on any of three battlefields, casting possessions that can improve your minion's traits and abilities; or sorcery cards with various direct effects. Also as an action you can add more energy to your Energy Pool, draw more cards, move minions to another battlefield etc. The choice is yours, it is just about your pure skill to handle the battle preparation!&#10;&#10;In the Battle Phase players roll amount of custom dice equal to each minion's attack trait with possible outcome of miss, hit, double hit or critical hit for each die, and place damage counters on the respective minions or directly to the Battlefield. A unique system of Omen tokens then allows to adjust this outcome by re-rolling the dice, before distributing the damage among opponent's minions and battlefield.&#10;&#10;The combination of usual mechanics like story driven deck building, push your luck or dice-rolling; and a unique system of influencing the outcome of the battle, provides a perfect balance between strategy and random elements (even you still have the possibility to influence the outcome). Dividing the round to the Action Phase and Battle Phase then creates a very pleasant and natural flow of the hardcore game play.&#10;&#10;Sorcerer was first developed in 2012, and in 2014, Peter Scholtz consulted with Czech and Slovak board gaming communities intensively to fine tune the mechanics of the game. In August 2014, the first &ldquo;Print and Play&rdquo; demo version of Sorcerer was published, responding to all the remarks and feedback Peter Scholtz received, allowing him to create both his upgraded, native language demo and finally the, English language version of Sorcerer. The Sorcerer prototype was available for the wide audience as a free to play testing material over the year 2014. After another year of intense work and listening to the game community, Peter Scholtz went to Essen Spiel to meet some of the greatest board game publishers and show them the game. After a meeting with Rob Dougherty, CEO of the White Wizard Games, game designer (Star Realms, Hero Realms, and Epic card game), and last but not least, MTG Hall of Fame player, the dice was finally rolled. In 2016, Peter Scholtz become a White Wizard Games team member and together they prepared the game for its KS campaign launch in November 2017.&#10;&#10;"

Visit their dreams to lead them home!&#10;&#10;Dingo's Dreams is a delightful and clever family game for 2-4 players. Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. Each player also starts with one extra tile, with a picture of their animal on it. The opposite side of all dreamscape tiles also has a picture of the animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When a player flips a tile, it means their animal is traveling through a part of the dreamscape. Each player's goal is to guide their animal through the dreamscape by positioning him in a specified pattern (which is different each game).  After a card is drawn, a player takes their extra animal and slides him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side.  The player will use this tile to shift another column or row on the next turn, and so on, until one player's dreamscape tiles match the goal.  The player then shouts their animal's name-- &quot;Dingo!&quot;, for example, to win the round.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules add Hazard Tokens which increase the challenge substantially: to complete the required dream pattern, the player may not have his animal in any of the Hazard spaces marked on the dream card.&#10;&#10;"

Acting troupes from all over the land will come together to perform plays of light-hearted comedy or soul-wrenching tragedy. Will their performance win the favour of the king or will his fickle mood spell a flop?&#10;&#10;In Histrio, you travel the land recruiting actors to join your troupe. Assemble the right team and you might earn enough money to pay for an entire year of shows. It'll take careful planning and a little luck to out-perform your competitors. The play is the thing in Histrio, and the world is your stage!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, cards are dealt to eight cities where players can travel to recruit actors. Some of the cards are actors, some grant money, and several are animal characters with special abilities. Players then secretly select a city where they will travel, and all players simultaneously reveal their chosen cities. If a city was chosen by only one player, that player gets all cards at the city. If a city was chosen by more than one, all cards are discarded, each player gets a secret objective card instead, and any actor cards are used to influence the king's mood toward either comedies or tragedies. At the end of the season, players earn money based on how many comedian or tragedian actors they have compared to the king's mood. The player with the most money at the end of two seasons wins.&#10;&#10;"

Balance your way along the path made of sewer grates, and try to get farther than the other players. The winner is crowned the ultimate Ninja master!&#10;&#10;Players set up a path of 16 manhole covers (4 different colors) that lead to the green manhole cover, which is the door to the Turtles' sewer home.  Each player spins the spinner to determine in which order he or she will move along that home to the finish line.  Based on each spin, players attempt to negotiate the color sequence of manhole covers that are their path.  Players must follow the sequence, moving foot, hand, foot hand as far as they can while maintaining their balance.  Once each player is done with their turn, they place their foam &quot;sai&quot; or Japanese sword, at the last manhole cover successfully reached.  It's from there that the player will begin their next turn.  Be the first Ninja warrior to reach the green manhole cover 3 times and become the &quot;ultimate Ninja warrior&quot;!&#10;&#10;"
