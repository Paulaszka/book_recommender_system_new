Unfortunately, they won't always listen. Before collecting resources, you have to drop all the workers in that resource's space through &quot;The Passage&quot;, a three-dimensional, mountain shaped tower where they will tumble and get stuck, leaving only a few to get out and actually collect that resource. The rest will have to wait to be knocked loose on a future turn.&#10;&#10;So if you send a worker to the forest to collect wood and berries, they might end up in the mountains collecting herbs, on the plains hunting for fur, or in the &quot;Love Tent&quot; making...your population larger. They might also bring some predators out of The Passage with them &mdash; or not come back at all.&#10;&#10;Players use the resources their workers end up with to arm their workers with spears and drums, to build a larger cave, or to create an invention, which earns victory points for their tribe.

You must question your friends, relatives, acquaintances, or even strangers about their whereabouts at the time of the murder, as well as dredge up some information about their lives, in order to determine who the murderer is. Have casual conversations with them, ask innocent questions, but don't let them know that they are murder suspects!&#10;&#10;Number of Players&#10;&#10;One.  However, this solitaire game requires the player to speak with at least five other people.&#10;&#10;Expected Play Time&#10;&#10;Anywhere between 30 minutes and several days, depending on how often you speak with people.&#10;&#10;The Longer Pitch&#10;&#10;To play, print out the Case #27 PocketMod and put it in your pocket, along with a pen or pencil. Go about your day, having casual conversations with those around you. When someone asks you &quot;How are you doing?&quot; or a derivative thereof, that triggers the start of the game. That person is designated as the murder victim. You must now find out where they died, how they died, who killed them, and why.&#10;&#10;As you go about your day, other conversations you have and other people you encounter will give you further clues. Piece together the evidence to bring the guilty party to justice!&#10;&#10;Record your evidence on the PocketMod. Once you have solved the case, post your results online to reveal the murderer!&#10;&#10;The Explanation&#10;&#10;This is an idea I've had for a long time. I wanted to encourage gamers who are naturally shy or reserved (ahem... like myself) to have conversations with those around them. I thought it would be fun to have a game where the player's conversations with others and the things happening around them would trigger events or give the player tools to solve problems in the game.&#10;&#10;Detective stories largely involve the protagonist going around having conversations with people in order to gather clues. That's easily translated into a game that can fit into one's pocket or purse!&#10;&#10;I came up with different &quot;triggers&quot; that will give the player pieces of evidence. For example, the first suspect you encounter will be the first person to say some derivative of &quot;Hello&quot; to you once the game has begun. This will force the player to carry on a conversation with that person to find out such things as: where they were during the time of the murder, how they knew the victim, and whether they possessed the murder weapon.&#10;&#10;Try to innocently ask people questions without giving away the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

A fast, engaging game of following the rules and acting like fools! You&rsquo;ll be drooling for more!&#10;&#10;Players are dogs working together during a series of tests (rounds) given to them by famous Dogtors such as Sigmund Fetch, Collie Jung, and Bark F. Skinner! Each round one player is the Dogtor and ensures that the dogs are following the rules.&#10;&#10;All players start with 3 bones. If they ever make a mistake they lose a bone and if one player is out of bones the game ends immediately. However,&#10;&#10;The dogs (players) are tested each round by being dealt 5 cards from the test desk which they do not look at. The test deck consists of numbered cards in 3 suits (BLUE,YELLOW and BROWN) each featuring 6 different dog commands (SIT,SHAKE,SPEAK, FETCH,ROLLOVER and BEG). There are also 6 BELL cards in the test deck which are WHITE and valued at zero.&#10;&#10;On a player&rsquo;s turn they will flip one of their dealt test cards and say the total value of the test. The first player may flip a YELLOW SHAKE ONE and they would state &ldquo;ONE&rdquo;.  The second player may flip a BROWN BEG TWO and they would state &ldquo;THREE&rdquo;, and so on.&#10;&#10;The parameters/rules may change the value of a card or add an action requirement when a card type is played. Example rules are: SIT commands = ZERO or Bark when any BLUE card is played. Each round another parameter/rule is added making it more challenging to complete the full series of test. It is the Dogtor's job each round to ensure the dogs are following the rules.&#10;&#10;If a dog announces the total value of the test correctly, the Dogtor will say GOOD DOG. This signifies that the dog was correct and the next dog (player) may go. In the event that a dog is incorrect, the Dogtor will say BAD DOG.&#10;&#10;Whenever you are a bad dog, you lose one bone. The Dogtor then resets the total test value to zero and play continues until all dogs are out of test cards.  The game end immediately once one dog is out of bones and all players fail. However, players may share bones in between rounds as long as each player has at least one bone but no more than 3 bones. If all players still have bones at the end of your final round, you pass! Your collective score is based on the total number of bones at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Pavlov's Dogs has 3 levels of difficulty: Puppy (3 rounds), Dog (5 rounds) or Wolf (8 rounds).

However, the young pirates can&rsquo;t approach the island directly by boat, because the surrounding sea is too rough and dangerous &ndash; and they would all get seasick! Then they have the idea of building a bridge. This will help them reach their goal in safety, even though the big waves make building difficult. Keep a cool head and use your building skills, and your pirate may be the first to make a stable bridge which he can cross to reach the island and find the treasure.&#10;&#10;The players take turns to throw the symbol dice and gradually construct a bridge with the pieces thrown. The first player to finish building a complete bridge to the small island is allowed to cross it straight away and dig up the treasure.&#10;&#10;The parent/teacher takes a &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; (e.g. a couple jelly bears, or a little treasure chest) and hides it under the palm tree.&#10;&#10;"

There are also cards like &quot;Picky Eater&quot; and &quot;Mystery Pepper&quot; that have special effects on your taco's taste.&#10;&#10;When you think a taco has the right ingredients and spices, instead of playing a card on your turn, claim one of the tacos, removing it from play.

SLASHR is a fast playing, free wheeling Slasher Movie emulator captured in 9 simple playing cards.&#10;&#10;Before starting play, make sure that you set the rating for this movie (a PG-13 game is very different than the Hard R version).  If we are okay with our movie getting a hard R Rating, make sure that the players are all comfortable with that.  You may want to check out some standard RPG safety mechanics - such as an X-CARD.&#10;&#10;Have everyone sit around a circle.  Take your SLASHR deck, shuffle it, and put it in the middle of the area you are playing, in easy reach for all the players.  If you really want to get in the mood, service some greasy popcorn, turn the lights down and sing &quot;Let's All Go to the Lobby&quot;.&#10;&#10;As a group, come up with a setting for a 1980s-style exploitation flick.  Once you have a setting, settle on a title for the film.  The setting and title are going to really lock down what the players do over the course of the movie.&#10;&#10;The first player is the last person to have seen a horror movie.  They begin the game by introducing themselves (their actual self) as starring as a character in the movie.  So, for instance, let's say that we are playing a movie called Unholy Pigskin (a PG-13 slasher about a High School Football team full of vampires.  You would say something like, &quot;Starring Chris O'Neill as Head Coach N. Romancer&quot;. Then have the next player in the circule introduce themselves and so on, until everyone has been introduced.&#10;&#10;Each player will then take a turn creating a scene in the Movie.  The most important thing to remember is that you are SETTING UP A SCENE - not resolving it.  To properly set up a scene, it should involve your character, at least one other character, and a location. These two players should both want something, or need an answer to a question.  This simple mechanic should drive us immediately into action.  &quot;Okay, so the Cheerleader and I are having a fight in the parking lot about leaving town.&quot;&#10;&#10;When the scene starts, the players can start role-playing their characters, or narrating activity in the scene.  Anyone that is not directly involved in the scene acts as additional &quot;uncredited&quot; characters and background effects.&#10;&#10;When one of the following happens, ANY PLAYER should yell CUT!&#10;&#10;     A Character is about to get the thing they want.&#10;     A Character is about to get the answer to a question.&#10;     Anything stupid, weird, or dangerous occurs.&#10;     Things are getting slow or boring in any way.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whenever someone yells CUT! the active player takes the SLASHR deck, cuts it, and flips over the top card.  Depending on the card, the scene is then resolved in a specific way.  After resolving the scene, shuffle the deck and play passes to the next player clockwise.&#10;&#10;FEAR, LUST, LIES, GREED, or STUPIDITY(THE RED CARDS) If the player cuts to a RED CARD, they resolve the scene in their favor using the prompt on the card, then return that card to the deck.&#10;&#10;MURDERED (BLACK CARDS)&#10;When you pull a BLACK CARD, you got Murdered.  In the game, this means that this scene - no matter what it was about - ends in your grisly murder at the hands of the SLASHR KILLR.  Only the ACTIVE PLAYER dies, and they always get to narrate their own death!  If the Slasher has not been revealed yet, the death should be laden with mystery.&#10;&#10;When you die, you flip over the remaining cards in the SLASHR deck and take one of the 5 RED CARDS out (Fear, Lust, Lies, Greed, and Stupidity) and plays it face up in front of them.&#10;&#10;When your character has been eliminated, you are still playing.  If it becomes your turn again, instead of setting up a scene with your character - you set up and narrate a quick scene using your prompt as inspiration.  You are encouraged to be the unnamed people in the other player's scenes in the movie, to add narration, to make sound effects, and to shout encouragement from your theater seats.&#10;&#10;Don't forget to put the BLACK CARD back into the deck.&#10;&#10;DON'T TURN AROUND&#10;If the player cuts to DON'T TURN AROUND, they have a brush with Death, but don't die.  Early on in the game, when this happens - the player should narrate their &quot;jump scare&quot; or &quot;cheap heat&quot; moment - cats jumping out, car crashes, kids pretending to be the murderer, etc.&#10;&#10;After the SLASHR is in play, this card should always result in a near death experience with the SLASHR KILLR.  Put the card back in the deck.&#10;&#10;SLASHR&#10;When you flip the SLASHR card - you are the SLASHR.  You should resolve the scene as the SLASHR, revealing your identity and motive.  You get to resolve the scene in your favor - but as your can only die when you are the active player, your opponent in the scene does not get killed.&#10;&#10;YOUR INEVITABLE GRISLY DEATH&#10;As you play, you will be removing cards form the deck, and making it MORE LIKELY that the next player is going to die. With either (a) the deck runs out of RED Cards, or (b) there is only the SLASHR. and one other person alive; the game ends.  Each player that was eliminated during the game gets a chance to &quot;pitch&quot; the ending of the movie to the remaining player(s).  The ending should involved the survivors defeating the SLASHR or getting away.  Afterwards, the SLASHRget to add a &quot;sequel clause&quot; scene where they show how they actually survived for the next movie.&#10;&#10;"

Humans and Vampires will also face the members of a Secret Society (formed by members of these races), which wants to pursue their own goal and can be played as a third faction or by a bot.&#10;&#10;Each faction draws cards and play them: in this way one player can place tiles and/or move special portals, to create a path for their miniatures or to disrupt the route of the opponent's models. The goal is to arrive close to the Chosen One, to catch her and to bring in the own base. Obviously, each player have to balance the ability of the own three Characters, decide which artifact to buy and when attack the other miniatures, to steal the Chosen One from the other faction or to kill an enemy model.&#10;The Secret Society's goal, instead, is to allow the Chosen One to complete her full path: so they can help one faction or the other, but only for a future personal gain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

It's designed by Enrico Acerbi, using the Vive la France: Empire rules system, in the ideal prosecution of two already published games, Mass&eacute;na at Loano and Wise Bayonets. It covers the masterpiece battle fought and won by Napoleon against the hopes of the III Coalition. At the sunset of December 2nd, 1805, the map of Europe was redrawn for many years to come, and the art of war had a new master.&#10;&#10;The map (scale 1:30.000) depicts the famous zone around the Pratzen heights. Each hex covers approximately 450-500 meters. Each turn represents 1 hour of real time. The counters represent 500/600 infantry for each strength point, or 75/150 cavalry men.&#10;&#10;Medium/low complexity, playable in solitaire.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

We sloths are sitting around, of course, while all the other animals are running throughout the resort. We want to look around, too, and traveling around the resort to pick up tasty leaves would be great &mdash; but running around ourselves is just too tedious. All the other animals are having fun, and we want that, too, but...we are so slothful.&#10;&#10;And then we have an idea: We'll let ourselves be carried around by the other animals, thus getting around nicely. The other animals have so much energy that they'll even gladly carry us. They aren't slothful! Which of us sloths will be the first to get through the entire country and be victorious? We are ambitious, but so lazy!&#10;&#10;Fast Sloths (a.k.a. &quot;Faultier&quot; in German) is a race game that at its core is a classic pick-up-and-deliver game &mdash; except that we ourselves are the cargo being delivered. We are being carried along the whole way and never take a single step on our own!&#10;&#10;You always play with six out of twelve different animal species, and you can place the giant game board in four different combinations. On a turn, you draft 2-3 cards of different animal types from the top of their face-up decks, then you play as many animal cards as you like of a single type. Each animal provides a different type of movement or interaction with you, with ants carrying you along in a chain and the elephant throwing you with its trunk.&#10;&#10;Fast Sloths is a game free from randomness that evolves only through the interaction between the players, doing so without any &quot;take that&quot; mechanisms &mdash; except for you snatching an animal from under the other players' noses because you need to use it yourself.&#10;&#10;Each race offers new challenges for you to get to the different trees faster than the other sloths. Enjoy all 256 different combinations, each with countless starting positions of the animals on the game board...and we are already working on new game boards and more animals for even more fun combinations!&#10;&#10;"

You may play as one of the warring vampire clans such as Ventrue, Tremere, Gangrel, or Toreador, or perhaps you'll choose to become one of the human factions fighting for their own desires, such as City Hall, the Mafia, or the Arcanum, with many more from which to choose.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the game integrates the story world of Vampire: The Masquerade by adding storyteller scenarios that add an optional narrative approach to the game. Players also gain disciplines, which give them powerful supernatural abilities unique to their character. Lastly, teams will choose their ambitions, which allow for multiple paths to victory, such as being bloodthirsty, manipulative, greedy, or somewhere in between.&#10;&#10;Blood Feud is dubbed a &quot;Mega Board Game&quot; because unlike a traditional board game, it isn't played at a single table. Blood Feud requires a large room or two separate rooms with 2-4 tables. One game table features the Cityscape and Orders, the map where players move their forces around the city and order them to fight and take control of important territories. The other game table features the Council and Market, where players use their best diplomatic and resource management skills to make sly trades, buy upgrades and player level-ups, and make large political decisions that will shape the destinies of teams to determine whether they win or lose! In order to win the game, teams earn victory points through the completion of Ambitions, which are secret objectives that can consist of all sorts of tasks and achievements  earned through gameplay.&#10;&#10;"

Now the land is ours, and we can spread destruction and chaos as we like it!&#10;&#10;But it's not that easy to live together with the other dirty goblin clans, especially since we are threatened by dangers here as well. We trade, research, fight diseases, build buildings, and strive to be the most powerful and respected of all the clans. I might be forced to join forces with other clans, but afterwards, it will all be mine &mdash; you'll see!&#10;&#10;By recruiting and playing goblins in 'Pact', you try to fulfill the tasks as quickly and effectively as possible. You fulfill the tasks alone or together with one of your two neighbors. Therefore, you get a reward while both of you scores at the end of the game. At the end of the year, when winter comes, the fruits of your labor will be visible and the balance of power will be decided.&#10;&#10;Thematically 'Pact' is a sequel of 'Pandoria' after the goblins have expelled the remains of the five Realms and now have settled the Hiddenlands on their own.&#10;&#10;'&mdash;description from the publisher'&#10;&#10;"
