This is the only way to pay due tribute to their friend and professor in order to educate the world and the church. So, they organize themselves into a handful of scriveners and set to writing the great biography. But they might get hard pressed for time!&#10;&#10;While playing Luther &ndash; Das Kartenspiel we have the chance to slip into the shoes of these scribes. The teamwork, as usually happens, swings into a little rivalry: who will reap the glory, which comes with chronicling certain stages of life? Who will be the one taking the most manuscripts to the printing house? What&rsquo;s more, from time to time, the diligent work of the scribes is interrupted by the least expected incidents such as: a carefully inscribed sheet of paper burns or changes hands &ldquo;accidently&rdquo;, or a crafty fellow scribe filches a page, or mixes foolish rumours into the reliable notes.&#10;&#10;"

Match fly colors to the fish's preferences and roll dice to reel them in!  You also get to cooperate with other players to get Invasive Species out of the river and prevent them from completely shutting down the fishing.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;On their turn, players draw a card to their fly box (hand) and either make a cast with a fly of their choosing, or play one of several special &quot;helper&quot; cards.  When making a cast, the player places their fly on the table and declares which card in The Big Stream they are casting to.  The Big Stream card is turned over revealing either a fish, invasive species, or hazard.  If a fish is revealed, it shows its fly preferences, which dictates how many dice you get to roll and what number is needed to succeed in catching it.&#10;&#10;The game includes two card decks: The Big Stream and Camp Tightloops.  The Big Stream contains fish, Invasive Species, hazards, and weather events.  Camp Tightloops contains three different types of flies in four different colors and special cards to give you an edge when you need it.  Some high points fish in The Big Stream require very specific flies to have a chance at them, just like big fish int he real world!  But, if you don't have the right fly in the box, you have the option of playing your special cards, wild cards, or creating a &quot;wild&quot; out of playing different fly type/color combinations with multiple cards.  Invasive species yield points to both players who cooperate in defeating them, and the player who cleans out the most invasives gets a bonus point token at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Is the best strategy to go for several smaller fish or take a chance on the larger high point fish? Should you go after the growing invasive species threats hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for the easy fish you know are there? Do you take chances on netting another player's fish to split the points with them or hope they fail their roll? Every time you play Chuckin' Bugs, The Big Stream has changed like your favorite fishing river.  You never know what lurks under the surface!&#10;&#10;"

Player then begins telling a TALL TALE using one of the pieces drawn until all the pieces are included in the story. The story can be as wacky or fun as your imagination will allow. When the story is over, all the pieces go back into the story bag, and the next player draws to start their TALL TALE.&#10;World Tales: Follow the BASIC GAME directions. After drawing 8 story pieces, draw one story place card and use that card as an environment for your TALL TALE. As you tell your story, place your story pieces on the story place card as used.&#10;Taller Tales: Choose a number 9 to 50. One player draws one piece to use in their story. Once that piece is used, that player draws another piece which must be the next piece they use in their story. The story continues until the number of pieces chosen to use is achieved. Story place cards may be added for even more variations.&#10;Group Tales: Each player draws two or more story pieces, making the total number of pieces among all players between 10 and 20 (or whatever amount you desire). The first player chooses one piece they&rsquo;ve drawn and begins the story. Once the first player uses their piece in the tale, they pass the story onto the second player who continues, using one of their pieces. The story passes from player to player until all players have used up all their pieces.

In both battles, the &quot;invincible&quot; Livonian Order - an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Knights - met their enemies atop a frozen body of water, and in both cases, they suffered a humiliating defeat.&#10;&#10;The 1242 battle at Lake Peipus was immortalized in Sergei Eisenstein's rousing film &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, and is probably the first thing most folks think of when they hear &quot;Battle on the Ice&quot;. This battle should have been a cakewalk for the Livonians, as their elite, well-armed, ruthless cavalry were facing a feudal army of peasants. But Nevsky exhibited sound tactical judgment, and a deployment of his own cavalry at just the right time turned the tide decisively in his favor. Similar to THE GRUNWALD SWORDS or S&amp;S I game OUR ROYAL BONES, this battle allows the Novgorod Player to choose the exact moment to bring in his horse archers (making their first appearance in the S&amp;S II series). The longer he waits, the more VP he'll score, but the greater the chance that it'll be too late.&#10;&#10;The 1270 Battle of Karuse, fought on the frozen Baltic Sea, is a bit more obscure, but quite possibly more interesting. This time around it's the Livonians and their allies against a Lithuanian Army under Grand Duke Traidenis. The Lithuanians use sleds as a defensive barrier, and use hit-and-run tactics to unhorse the bold brothers. Special rules for unhorsing, dismounting, and charging the sleds give this one a lot of nuance.&#10;&#10;Both battles see a force that's strong in cavalry brought low by a force that's predominantly fighting on foot. Semi-random force pools utilized in each battle provide additional replayability. As always, the core S&amp;S II system - easy to learn, teach, and play - allows for a fun, fast, streamlined medieval experience.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You try to get into a good company on your first go and prosper for life, or get hired by an unknown small company and you are doomed. Changing jobs suggests to employers that there is something wrong with you.&#10;&#10;Therefore, for pre-graduates, the process of landing your first job became hugely important, really defining your whole future. This process is called &#229;&#176;&#177;&#230;&#180;&#187; (Shuukatsu),from two words: &#229;&#176;&#177;&#232;&#129;&#183; (Shuushoku) meaning 'to get a job' and &#230;&#180;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149; (Katsudou) meaning 'activity'.&#10;&#10;This game Shukatsu! is a co-operative game to simulate the experience of winning a job offer. The game was designed and published by a professional career advisor. He says &quot;Experience an year of job hunting, in an hour. The game is based on 20 years experience as an advisor, you would have a live experience. You may try to beat it purely as a game, but also it may be used as an job-hunting support tool. In that case, the creator may act as a facilitator to gain the best effects.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game uses various types of cards, for example, for the job-hunters:&#10;Activity card - study companies, attend ability training session.&#10;Weakness card - don't study for unknown matters, habitual latecomer, impatient.&#10;&#10;For the employers:&#10;Company card - industrial newspaper press, internet brokerage.&#10;Hiring requirements - co-operativeness 3+, aspiration 3+.&#10;&#10;Also, some cards have Bad Events, for example:&#10; - too busy on part-time job.&#10; - suffer burnout.&#10;&#10;On the setup, lay out some company cards and assign them requirements cards. These would be the goals of the game for the job-hunters.&#10;&#10;Each of the players will be assigned some parameters, and some Weakness cards. By using the Activity cards, players work together to overcome those weakness, and eventually meet the requirements of those companies.&#10;&#10;Every once in a while, some Bad Events occur. Players must also work together to beat them too. At the end of the game year, if all of the players have managed to meet the requirements of some of the companies, they are hired and they win. If anyone fails to get a job, they all lose.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#182;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#232;&#129;&#183;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;1&#229;&#185;&#180;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#232;&#129;&#183;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;1&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#168;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;20&#229;&#185;&#180;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#182;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#231;&#181;&#140;&#233;&#168;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#233;&#168;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#180;&#148;&#231;&#178;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#136;&#182;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#232;&#129;&#183;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#230;&#143;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Some dimensions contain cards that make the trip across the board easier, while other dimensions make the journey more perilous. Players must balance their urge to race across the board with their need to blast other players into neighboring dimensions. To win, a player must make it across the lab to their own control panel.&#10;&#10;Each turn every player gets to perform one movement action and one 'Slipstream Gun' action. The movement action allows the players to move their token to a neighboring card, edging ever closer to their control panel, and victory. For their 'Slipstream Gun' action, players can choose to shoot any player (sending them to another dimension) or they can 'recalibrate' their gun by flipping the card over. This changes what dimension players will go to when shot with the 'Slipstream Gun'.&#10;&#10;Players start at one end of a 4x5 card grid. Their control panels are on the opposite side. All of the laboratory cards are face down and as players move on to each card, it is flipped face up and the events on the face of the card are incurred. These can offer benefits like moving forward or gaining an item card. They can also be negative like losing a turn or being sent to the 'Dark World' a dimension in which the cards are much more challenging.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player is able to make it all the way across the board and steps on to the colored control panel that matches their player token.&#10;&#10;"

Yet, makeup can be a complicated thing. Youtube is filled with Internet celebrities who give expert advice, magazines roll out new style guides practically monthly, and everyone has a different face, meaning something that works for one person might not work so well for the next. To give younger girls an introduction to makeup, as well as a few deeper lessons about true beauty, Decker Sisters presents Pretty Pro: The Exciting Makeover Race Game.&#10;&#10;To play, each player picks a character from the four playing pieces: Lauren, Izzy, Lexie, and Zoe. These characters come with profile cards that give a little background to them. These do not have any affect on the gameplay; they just allow players to get a little more into the game by picking their favorites. Each has a favorite color, pet, and hobby. They also give tips, both in fashion (&ldquo;accessorize with scarves&rdquo;), beauty (&ldquo;always wear sunscreen when outside&rdquo;), and internal beauty, described as a PrettyHeart quality (&ldquo;always have a positive attitude&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;Pretty Pro is a straightforward game suitable for younger players. On a turn, a player rolls the dice and moves her or his character to a new square on the board. The goal is to land on each square necessary for the six components of a makeover: Lipstick, Blush, Eyeshadow, Brows, Earrings, and the PrettyHeart Tiara, which denotes inner beauty. The board also features stylish cities, where players draw cards. Some are good, such as &ldquo;You are always kind with your words and never say anything hurtful. Find the PrettyHeart Tiara.&rdquo; Others are not so good, &ldquo;You went to bed very late last night. Now you feel grouchy and look tired. Lose your next turn.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Facemask card. Players might be unlucky in landing on a Beauty Block square and missing out on something they need or gain the Facemask, which stops players from adding any new makeup. When a player lands on Beauty Block, she or he may move it to a new space, potentially keeping another player from getting the final square needed to win.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the best part of Pretty Pro is the coloring sheets. The set comes with colored pencils and a pad for each character, and extras may be printed off the website. Through the game, whenever a player lands on a space she needs, the player may color in the makeup on the character&rsquo;s face. This is a great introduction into style, seeing what colors work, what is not enough, and what might be too much.&#10;&#10;Pretty Pro is a game for two to four players aged six and up. It is a moderately long game, taking twenty to thirty minutes to play, depending on how quick and lucky the players are. With its randomized dice-rolling play and fun coloring sheets, younger players will enjoy it the most as they eagerly assemble the parts of their makeovers.&#10;&#10;Which make-up artist will win the game?  Players use strategy, skill and luck as they race their friends to create the perfect look, but soon learn that inner beauty is needed before any makeover is complete.  Game cards reward kindness and cover fun topics including beauty and fashion tips.  Hurry to be the first to capture the PrettyHeart Tiara and finish the face to win this exciting makeover race!&#10; Ages 6+, 2-4 players, 15-20 minute play time, reading not required to play.&#10; Contents:  Game board, 52 card deck, coloring pencils, facemask, beauty block, PrettyHeart Tiara,  set of 4 make-up sketch pads, set of fun info cards, character playing pieces, stands, dice, instructions.&#10;&#10;"

Each player builds and deploys their supply of Missiles, Nukes and Interceptors on a mission to destroy as many enemy cities they can, while trying to protect their own.&#10;&#10;Each round, the players can negotiate with each other, forging temporary alliances and truces, or trading funds and Missiles. Then, they secretly plot their attacks behind their Radar Screens. Finally, they reveal their attacks, and destruction rains down from the skies!&#10;&#10;In the end, the player who can best protect their cities while destroying their opponents' wins the game!&#10;&#10;"

Players who enjoy a satisfying puzzle will appreciate the difficulty in adding the chosen bot to their factory. Each slot has a die on either side that will be modified based on the chosen bot card.

Over a hundred years have passed after the American War for Independence was interrupted by the opening of the first rift and the Legion of Damned poured though. Humanity was facing extinction at the hands of the demonic and undead. Finally the Angelics arrived and set a stop to the expansion of the rifts and halted the free roaming Legion hordes. Once on the brink of extinction humanity has surged back, forging new countries and technologies. Now after decades of rebuilding the uneasy peace is starting to fracture. Skirmishes are becoming more frequent along the borders and nations turn to warmongering.&#10;Titan Zero Industries LLC presents Ictus, a table top wargame set in the Stempunk apocalypse of 1909. Ictus features high quality miniatures, six unique factions, an all-new stacking rule set and multiple game scenarios including cooperative play. &#10;In standard Skirmish or competitive game scenarios the goal is to eliminate the other player(s) officers. However, in cooperative play scenarios the goals of the game can vary to include eliminating the enemy, surviving for a number of rounds or achieving a set goal. &#10;Each unit is a paintable miniature that comes with a corresponding card that details the abilities of that character. While many abilities are set, conflict is resolved by the rolling of six sided dice (D6), with rolls of 5&rsquo;s and 6&rsquo;s being considered successful. Stacking is the major game mechanic. The Shield Warden unit, for example, provides a +1 defensive bonus to all allies within 1&rdquo;. If there are three Shield Wardens within 1&rdquo; of each other the bonuses stack and each unit would receive a +3 defensive bonus.&#10;There are six different factions to choose from; the British American Colonies, Mercenaries, United American Territories, Legion of Damned, Republic of Cascadia and Empire of Castile. Each faction has a unique look and play style.&#10;&#10;"
