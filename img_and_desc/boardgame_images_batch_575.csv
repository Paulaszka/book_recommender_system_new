The flagship game of the independent company ZAMA Game Design, Swords and Heroes challenges players in a simple-yet-engaging combat system.&#10;&#10;The game uses a detailed &ldquo;Cards and Shards&rdquo; system that uses board-based tactical &ldquo;shards&rdquo; to represent battlefield units of the respective armies. Basic statistics and abilities of these units are represented by beautifully-designed game cards held by each player. Units range from light-armored infantry to long-ranged archers or heavy cavalry, but vary wildly based on the historical civilization chosen by the player.&#10;&#10;After custom-designing their armies using a simple point-based creation mechanic, players field their armies and face off for the control of the board with easy-to-learn dice-based turn mechanics. Players also make use of &ldquo;General&rsquo;s Orders&rdquo; cards that offer players powerful and unique means of shifting the course of battle. Once the enemy has been eliminated from the board, the remaining general stands victorious!&#10;&#10;The Swords and Heroes: Starter Set comes with all of the necessary rules and game components required, as well as two Classical Age armies: The Roman Empire and the Germanic Tribes. Future expansion packs will also offer players additional armies, such as Han China, Alexander&rsquo;s Macedonia, Parthian Persia, and more!&#10;&#10;"

A character can perform three types of attack (sword, bow or magic attack), and each attack can be strong, causing great damages, or quick, causing damages more often. The damage intensity depends on the experience in that type of attack. A successful attack increases the experience of the fighter in that type of attack.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Players choose randomly who is the Human and who is the Elf.&#10;&#10;In a common paper is written down the initial experiences for each type of attack and the initial number of wounds of both characters, as shown below. Another option is to print the board in the section files.&#10;&#10;ELF &#10;Wounds: 0&#10;Sword: 2&#10;Bow: 3&#10;Magic: 2&#10;&#10;HUMAN&#10;Wounds: 0&#10;Sword: 3&#10;Bow: 2&#10;Magic: 2&#10;&#10;ATTACK: TYPES AND MODALITIES&#10;There are three types of attack: sword, bow and magic. For each of those there are two modalities: quick and strong.&#10;&#10;So, each player has 6 cards for every possible attack: strong sword, quick sword, strong bow, quick bow, strong magic, quick magic.&#10;&#10;You can print the custom cards in the images section. Another options is to use 6 cards, for each player, from an UNO game: two red cards with 1 and 3 values for quick sword and strong sword, two green cards with 1 and 3 values for quick bow and strong bow, two blue cards with 1 and 3 values for quick magic.&#10;&#10;Winning order: sword beats bow, bow beats magic and magic beats swords.&#10;&#10;TURN&#10;Each player places a face down card in the middle of the table. When both cards are placed, they are revealed.&#10;&#10;&bull; With a successful quick attack, the opponent takes a number of wounds equal to the value of experience the winner has in that type of attack.&#10;&bull; With a successful strong attack, the opponent takes a number of wounds equal to the value of experience the winner has in that type of attack multiplied by 3.&#10;&#10;After the opponent&rsquo;s damaging, the winner increases his experience in that type of attack by one.&#10;&#10;The winning order (sword &gt; bow; bow &gt; magic; magic &gt; swords) determines who has done a successful attack. If both players chooses the same type of attack, the winner is who played a quick attack.&#10;&#10;In case both players choose the same type of attack and the same modality, the player with less experience in that type of attack increases by one that type of attack and nobody takes any wounds. In case both players has the same amount of experience neither of them gain experience.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, the two cards just played stay on the table, aside but in full view and unavailable for the next turn. At the end of the next turn, the new played cards will stay on the table, whereas the cards from the previous turn will return in the players&rsquo; hands.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;The game ends when one player reaches a number of wounds greater than or equal to 100. (The game is perfectly scalable, so players can choose any number of wounds as end condition.)&#10;&#10;After that, players have to check who will get a bonus attack. Each player subtracts the value in his highest experience with the value his lowest experience. Who has the greater difference makes a number of wounds to the enemy equal to his highest experience multiplied by 3 (like a strong attack). If the differences are equal, whoever has less wounds gets the bonus attack..&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with less wounds.&#10;&#10;"

You will roam the countryside in search of treasure because you are a dragon &mdash; a young dragon, that is. You and your friends have just been kicked out of the nest for eyeing your parents' treasure hoards. The problem with being young is that you don't always succeed in your quest to find treasure, which often leads to havoc. To make matters worse, you must compete for the best loot with your friends by engaging in hijinks.&#10;&#10;Havok &amp; Hijinks is a fast-paced, light strategy card game that pits you against your friends in a race for the first respectable treasure hoard. Each turn starts with a quest for treasure that could lead to Havok like loot-hungry adventurers or beneficial heat waves. Engage in Hijinks by stealing and breaking your friend's shiny treasures or defending your own. When a dragon has a hoard with a value of 15 or more, it wins!&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Start your turn by flipping a Havok Card&#10;&#10;     Resolve any event flipped exactly as the card reads&#10;     Add any treasure flipped to your hoard&#10;&#10;&#10;Once you've resolved your Havok card you may play one Hijinks card&#10;You may also use your dragon's play ability&#10;&#10;You may choose not to play a Hijinks card and instead discard one to draw one&#10;&#10;Pass your turn&#10;&#10;"

Summon the right characters at the right time to outwit your opponents; use whatever strategy you can muster to overcome the randomness of the brawl! Amass the most glory along the way to become the ultimate champion in this crazy contest of luck and wits!&#10;&#10;For basic gameplay, players shuffle their deck and draw five cards to start the game. Each player simultaneously selects a character from his hand and plays them face down at the current location. Once all the players have selected their characters, flip over the cards to begin the brawl!&#10;&#10;After triggering any abilities revealed by the flip, players then compare their power type and power levels to determine who wins each scrap and the overall brawl. The winner gains one Glory (VP), plus activates any abilities their character may have that trigger off of winning. Each player then discards the played character, and draw one new card before the next round begins. The first player to reach ten Glory wins the game!&#10;&#10;Each card in IncrediBrawl has a unique ability, and each player will start the game with a copy of the same set of cards.
