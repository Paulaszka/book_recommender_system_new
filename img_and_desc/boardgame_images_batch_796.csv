Units are mostly corps (divisions for the USA, whose oversized units were nearly the size of Allied corps), and include infantry, tanks, cavalry and air support. The Germans start the 1918 campaign with large numbers of Stosstruppen, trained to overcome the trench stalemate of the previous  three years. This gives the German player a strong offensive capability in the first half of the game. But these &ldquo;shock troops&rdquo; are a wasting asset, and if the Allies survive the initial blows, growing numbers of US troops and Allied tanks will see the Germans forced into a desperate defense in the game's second half.&#10;&#10;In the Plan 1919 campaign, the Germans are assumed to have used the collapse of Russia to stabilize the Balkan and Italian fronts, forgoing the historical 1918 Kaiser's Battles in the West. The Allies are thus faced with a strong German defense, but with a fully mobilized American army and backed by masses of tanks and planes.  This hypothetical campaign challenges the Allies to leverage these arms into the world's first blitzkrieg, while the Germans fight to force a stalemate that will leave them dominant in Europe.&#10;&#10;The large-hex map, scaled at 8 miles to the hex, covers the active area of the Western Front, from Epinal in the south to Antwerp and the Channel Coast in the north. Terrain includes Forts, Allied trenches, German Secondary and Primary Trenches, Forts, Forest, Marsh, Flood Plain, Mountain, and the Devastated Zone created by the German withdrawal in the Somme sector in 1917. The map is back-printed with separate versions for the 1918 and 1919 Campaigns.&#10;&#10;Simple but not simplistic, this new GMT version of 1918/1919: Storm in the West can be played in a single session and offers players a wide range of strategic and operational choices in bloody but dynamic campaigns to decide the outcome of the First World War. With updated artwork by Mark Simonitch and Charlie Kibler, this new combined edition is a must for lovers of classic wargaming.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Miklos.  The map board depicts the northern half of the island including the fortified American positions around Butt's Hill. There are 64 America, British and Hessian combat units and leaders giving the game a counter density comparable to Saratoga in the series. Although the tactical situation is somewhat straightforward; Americans retreating and British pursuing primarily up two main roads, the nuanced play and game texture is like that found in all the games of the BoAR series.&#10;&#10;To ensure replay-ability, each player has a unique deck of 26 Opportunity Cards that either enhance his side or diminish the enemy. Cards are drawn at-start and occasionally throughout play as governed by the turn track. There are also mechanisms for card draw tied to accumulated casualties or the possession of terrain objectives. Players may also spend Momentum to purchase additional cards.&#10;&#10;The cards themselves may provide DRMs, adjustments to Army Morale, leader replacements, tactics advantages, step losses or step recovery, and additional units introduced into play among other outcomes. There is also the possibility of the game being extended one game turn into &quot;night&quot; wherein the British launch a surprise night attack. There are only a handful of Exclusive Rules to provide chrome including a squadron of British warships which may conduct off-shore bombardment. Players familiar with the core game system will be off and running in no time.&#10;&#10;As a bonus, volume 9 will include a second scenario; The Battle of Newport.  This hypothetical scenario features a second map board depicting the southern half of the island, the city of Newport and the British defensive works that surrounded it as well as the American siege lines. The French army is presumed to have stayed on the island to cooperate in a direct assault upon the town. It will make for a fascinating &quot;what-if&quot; study of the first attempt at cooperation in the war by Franco-American forces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

It takes the core roll-and-move mechanism of Backgammon and applies it to a two-dimensional point-to-point map with differentiated terrain and movement costs. As in Backgammon, players roll two dice at the start of their turn and make one move for each die. Rolling doubles allows four moves, but also enables multiple divisions that begin the turn stacked together to move as one, potentially achieving superior combat odds and an advantageous column shift. Combat is resolved using an odds-based, but completely deterministic, CRT, and losses are permanent. A pool of reinforcements can be brought in from your Capitol city. The game is won by either completely surrounding your opponent's Capitol, or by Eliminating sufficient enemy units that you outnumber them two-to-one.&#10;&#10;This is the second of Hollandspiele's annual holiday mini-games, the first of which (Christmas at White Mountain) gave birth to the successful Table Battles. It will be packed in, free of charge, with any order placed during the 2017 holiday sale containing at least two games.

There are 65 turns covering the entire period of the Punic Wars; players are not necessarily fighting the entire time as wars need to be declared and peace can be brokered by agreement. In between wars players can move troops around, get reinforcements, hire mercenaries, etc.&#10;&#10;Land units are represented by a small set of metal miniatures (included with the game); army strengths are presumably recorded on paper although this is not made very clear. Naval units are represented either by paper counters cut from a possibly-included sheet or by borrowed counters.

He orders his division's motorized infantry regiment, the crack 8th Bersaglieri, to occupy three battalion strongpoints around a key cross-roads near the well (bir) of Gubi. The 8th Bersaglieri, supported by the reinforced divisional artillery, begins moving into position around Bir el Gubi and digging in. Most of the M13/40 tanks of Ariete 's understrength 132nd Tank Regiment are kept to the rear.&#10;&#10;At the same time, General William Henry Ewart Gott, commander of the British 7th Armoured Divi-sion, orders the 22nd Armoured Brigade  (Brigadier John Scott-Cockburn) to attack the Ariete at Bir el Gubi, a complete change from his original orders for the brigade to secure Sidi Rezegh, 25 miles to the north. The reason for the change is still not clear: perhaps Gott hopes to give this well-equipped but inexperienced brigade an opportunity to season itself against an Italian formation that he assumes will be a weak opponent; possibly he just wants to clear his division's left flank before advancing. Whatever the reason, the full-strength brigade, equipped with 162 brand new Crusader tanks, is eager to emulate the Commonwealth's easy victories against the Italian Tenth Army die previous winter.&#10;&#10;The stage is set for a swirling desert battle between evenly matched opponents.&#10;&#10;Ariete covers this entire mobile action in turns representing 30 minutes each and a map scale of 150 meters per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. A minimal amount of special rules bring the Tactical Combat Series to North Africa, highlighting the unique tactical challenge of the desert environment.&#10;&#10;The Italian player must manage a mobile defense against stronger British armored units until reinforcements arrive in the form of the 132nd Tank Regiment. He must make good use of artillery and AT assets (especially truck-mounted 102mm guns) to bloody the Brits and set them up for an armored counterattack.&#10;&#10;The Commonwealth player must solve the problem of using an armor-only force to crack defensive positions held by a well-led combined-arms force.

Distribute the deck evenly among all the players, then lay out one card face up to start the discard pile. Each player takes four cards from the personal deck in hand, and they can draw more cards from it at any time &mdash; which may or may not be helpful.&#10;&#10;Each card shows a multiplication problem in its center, along with two individual digits in each corner. When the game begins, each player races to complete the multiplication problem on the top card in the discard pile, e.g. 6x9, then play a card on it that has in its corner a number that matches either the first or second digit of the product, in this case 5 or 4. This newly played card has a multiplication problem of its own, and someone will play a matching card on it, etc. Whoever plays all the cards in their hand and personal deck first wins.&#10;&#10;"

Players assume the role of one of the factions on the planet that is fighting desperately to survive. Throughout the game, players gather resources, capture enemy units, and work to construct their colony ship. Once built, the colony ship must be launched once all of your units are evacuated. The faction to do so first not only escapes with their lives but also ends up destroying the planet with the force of their ship's ignition. There are no points in Cysmic. The winner is the player who completes the objective first.&#10;&#10;THE STORY:&#10;&quot;The Space Exploration Expedition Network (SEEk) selected several leaders in various fields to lead an odyssey to Kepler-62e for terraforming and civilization planning. Some of the members were chosen and funded by the World Council while others self-financed their way to have influence or presence in the new world. Industry experts, religious leaders, entertainers, scholars, businessmen, politicians, and entrepreneurs all took part in the mission. Once there, the project worked beautifully at first. The different groups of people lived and worked together as a familiar society with all of the benefits and growing pains one would expect from a newly formed civilization. It had its share of infighting and corruption, but even those issues never threatened the delicate balance of this new world. It was slowly becoming the utopia many had hoped it would.&#10;&#10;As the project moved forward, an unexpected instability in the terraforming process started wreaking havoc on the landscape. The news broke quickly that their efforts to terraform and create a better world had destabilized the planet. Their new Eden was doomed.&#10;&#10;When the colonists realized there was no hope in saving their dream of a new civilization, chaos broke out among the hundreds of thousands of people as they turned to their respective leaders for salvation. Those in leadership roles... either voted in by public opinion, volunteered at will, ascended through capitalism, or ordained by faith... now rise to the occasion as wartime leaders.&#10;&#10;Massive Terraformers that once bent the landscape to their will have now been taken over by powerful organizations and converted into colony ship construction and launch platforms. These rival factions compete for information and resources across the dying planet as their last hope to escape offworld in the original Colony Ship plans that brought them there to begin with.&#10;&#10;After society splintered, the information splintered with it. Each faction holds part of the module plans to build the colony ship but must retrieve the others to finish their build. Instead of working together, they now battle for resources and information. Workers and civilians are hastily trained in combat to protect the individual faction bases from each other while still performing their regular job duties. Soldiers are tasked with capturing enemies with the knowledge of providing blueprints for the construction of the colony ship modules.&#10;&#10;Once the leaders obtain the blueprints and construct their colony ship, they must launch it before the impending destruction of their homeworld. The immense energy exerted from a single colony ship launch will likely doom the rest. Which faction will gain the resources necessary to escape first?&#10;If this new world war doesn&rsquo;t destroy this utopia, the planet surely would.&quot;&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:&#10;Gameplay consists of managing your empire until you can safely evacuate your people offworld. Players must recruit units, explore their surroundings, wage war against enemies, manage their economy, and obtain the resources necessary to construct their Colony Ship. The game is played in rounds made up of 5 turns per round. Each turn, players play one Unit card or Tactic card and then perform a bonus action. Each round ends when all players complete 5 turns. The next round starts with whomever currently holds the first player token.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE FOR WINNING THE GAME:&#10;Be the first player to build their colony ship and launch off the planet. Be careful evacuating your units before launching or else your conscience may not allow you to leave.&#10;&#10;"
