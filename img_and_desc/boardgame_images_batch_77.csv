During their turn, the active player can uncover in sequence up to four cards from the pile. If the same kind of fruit appears one after the other, then all cards uncovered in this turn are lost for the player. Since there are only three fruit sorts, this occurs regularly, so this provides tension both for children and adults.&#10;&#10;If a player has more than six of a set, then he loses everything that he collected so far from this set.&#10;&#10;If the player has exactly six pieces of a set, the player then receives a gopher trophy in exchange for the set. The first to get his third cup wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is not only pure gambling, but also offers tactical choices so children take part enthusiastically. The minimum age indicated by the manufacturer seems applicable as long as the child can count over six.&#10;&#10;"

However, there are some variations in this version which are immediately apparent when looking at the board.&#10;&#10;The board is 14x14 squares and has a variety of coloured spaces. In the middle are four squares, each of a player's colour, and in the corners are 3x3 grids used to store combinations of an opponent's captured pieces.&#10;&#10;The movement proceeds the same as with chess except under the following circumstance. When a player captures a certain combination of three of the opponent's pieces, that player's King is able to move 2 spaces at a time. If another combination is captured, the King may move the three spaces (which is the maximum).&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of two conditions is met: If a player is checkmated or if a player can get his/her King to the center square of his/her colour.&#10;&#10;There are several variations to the game.&#10;&#10;"

The first phase ended when the tanks of Panzergruppe Kleist emerged unscathed from the western end of the Ardennes Forest on 14 May, thus unhinging the entire Allied strategic plan. The third phase began on June 5, when the final drives into the heart of France were begun. For two weeks at the end of May, the Allies had a final chance to rebalance the situation. Had they succeeded in stabilizing a supplied bridgehead on the Flanders coast, or managed to smash the thinly-spread German mechanized formations while breaking out southward, all of subsequent World War II history would have been changed. Alternately, had the Germans succeeded in bagging the whole of the B.E.F., there would have been little or nothing to stop an Operation Sealion and no troops to send to North Africa.&#10;&#10;Game has a 12 turn Campaign scenario, and a 7/5 turn &quot;No Halt Order&quot; scenario to examine the ramifications of Hitler's mistake.

Each side is equipped with 1 troopship, 4 destroyers and 2 cruisers. Turns consist of ship movement and combat when applicable. There is no dice rolling (all attacks occur when an enemy ship is simply within range).&#10;&#10;"

Charles XII, King of Sweden, personally led an invasion deep into Tsar Peter the Great&rsquo;s realm. The Russians engaged in a successful defensive campaign which culminated in the epic battle of Poltava. As a result, Sweden&rsquo;s mastery of the north was forever smashed, and Russia emerged as a great European power.&#10;&#10;In ON TO MOSCOW, one player controls the Swedish side; the other controls the Russian side. The objective is to gain control of as many Fortress cities as possible and destroy the enemy&rsquo;s military power. Each side has a number of military units and leaders with which to attack enemy forces and gain control of Fortresses. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation.&#10;&#10;Players who want to learn the game quickly should just read the GENERAL RULE beneath each major rules section, and then follow the specific procedures within each section as the need arises during the course of play.&#10;&#10;"

It had its origins in the bitter conflict between Muslims and Christians, Slavs and Turks. The war proved to be a turning point in that it completely altered the balance of power in the east. In less than 40 years this helped produce the European catastrophe known as the Great War (WW I). Echoes of these ethnic and religious troubles resound today, as the peoples of Balkans and Near East still fight each other in a struggle for dominance. The Russo-Turkish War did not just cripple the Ottoman Empire. It made Russia into the dominant power in the East, and demonstrated the twin impact of modern technology and modern ideology on warfare.&#10;&#10;The System rules apply to all games in the Wars of the Imperial Age series, and simulate the conditions of warfare in the late 19th century. This is a revision of the System rules presented with Franco-Prussian War (S&amp;T #149), and completely replaces the System rules book found there. Important changes from the original version are indicated by a double pound sign (##) at the beginning of the rule. Players familiarizing themselves with the game may wish to use just the System rules. The Specific Rules that apply only to the particular game and cover military and political conditions unique to the specific situation.&#10;Units represent historical leaders and headquarters staffs; corps, division-, and brigade-sized units; and fortifications. Each unit is rated for its combat strength, training class, and movement ability. (Specific Rules) Additionally, headquarters are rated for their Operations capability to enhance movement and combat capabilities, as well as conduct various politically oriented functions.&#10;&#10;All units are deployed face down, and are revealed to the enemy only if he conducts reconnaissance or intelligence operations. Movement is performed by the moving force rolling on one of four March tables (Regular March, Forced March, Railroad, Naval) and applying the result. Combat is fought between enemy units in individual adjacent hexes; each player draws a Battle Results marker at random. This gives the number of enemy combat factors eliminated, effects on enemy morale, and special results for cavalry, and siege guns.The typical size of units are brigades.&#10;&#10;Politics are a factor in the game. Each side has a National Will Index which gives the current level of popular support. This is affected by combat outcomes and other game events. (Specific Rules) Each turn, players have the opportunity to draw Political Events markers, representing various factors affecting the outcome of the conflict.&#10; Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #154, Sep 1992.

The new neon-green-and-purple JX has blocks with slanted sides, allowing the players to construct towers that lean precariously to one side without toppling due to the weight distribution that the new blocks allow.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a competitive exercise where each player tries placing his block in a position so that the next player's block will make the tower fall over.

Mules &amp; jeeps are needed for movement; stores are used to sustain the expedition. Additional components include the game board, a sales price indicator, money and a deck of 52 cards.&#10;&#10;Players start with a sum of money and four cards. On his turn, the player must first pay his expenses either with cash or by expending a store. He then plays one (sometimes two) cards and follows the instructions. An 'Authority to Buy' card permits the purchase of one type of commodity (mules/jeeps/stores); the price of these items starts low but steadily increases with demand. Award cards give the player free commodities or allow cheap purchases from a rival. The most common cards, however, are the Camp cards. These are numbered from one to twelve, and playing an appropriate Camp card and transport item allows advancement within the same or subsequent group of camps on the board. If the player has a jeep, he can advance to two camps that turn provided he has two suitable Camp cards available. Money is earned upon reaching a new camp, and the turn is completed by drawing back up to four cards. By moving onto an already-occupied camp, you become the 'guest' of that player which forces him to pay for your upkeep as well as his own until one of you moves away. The winner is the first person to arrive at camp twelve.&#10;&#10;"

When a player has a card that matches the event that just occurred on the televised game, they must be the first to play it, thereby scoring the points on the card for that event (the rarer the event the more points).  When a player plays all seven of their cards, he gets a seven point bonus, everyone tallies their scores and a new hand is dealt.

In each round, teams try to guess as many of the 10 hidden keywords associated with a mystery topic as possible&mdash;all in just 20 seconds of rapid-fire talking.&#10;&#10;One team starts by &ldquo;talking about&rdquo; the subject, saying anything they can think of to hit those hidden clue words. Every word they match earns a point&mdash;but the twist comes next: the opposing team sees how many words weren&rsquo;t guessed, and then gets that many clues to help them guess an entirely new subject. If they guess it, they steal the round&rsquo;s points; if not, the talking team scores them.&#10;&#10;Teams then switch roles, and the gameplay continues with the same blend of strategy, deduction, and high-energy chatter.

On your turn, you can get off and attempt that path, or spin again, possibly rearranging you - and everyone else.&#10;&#10;Each path has its own movement system. A few of them are flip-a-tiles, with each tile set having movement from 1-5 on them. Health has a bicycle theme, with one wheel being the tiles and the other wheel being the discard pile. Self Improvement tiles were books in a bookcase.&#10;&#10;The Love path has an arrow-through-a-heart spinner, with the arrow pointing to your movement, 1-4. Two other paths also have themed spinners.&#10;&#10;But the coolest of them was the Friendship path. The Hand of Friendship is a seesaw hand with a little marble in the &quot;wrist&quot; and when you seesaw it, the marble &quot;pachinko's&quot; into one of the five fingers, each having a different movement number 1-5.&#10;&#10;When you finish a path - and they have text on some of the squares (&quot;start over&quot; &quot;get a hang-up&quot; &quot;move forward&quot; etc.) - you click back in to the spinner and hope you land on the next path you need.&#10;&#10;"

After this round the &quot;Sphinx&quot; takes all the propositions and reads them out (from 1 to 3, but in disorder for every sentence). Now the players note on an other paper, which propositions they think are the right ones, that means those of the &quot;Sphinx&quot;, the &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;s. Players do get points for every &quot;Wahre Walter&quot;, they noted and the &quot;Sphinx&quot; too gets points every time someone &quot;bets&quot; on his propositions, so the &quot;Sphinx&quot; has to be himself, the best possible. Furthermore do players, on whose propositions other players have bet get points, because they have successfully &quot;faked&quot; the &quot;Sphinx&quot;.
