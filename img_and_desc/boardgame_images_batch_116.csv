Each player (live or deadwood) controls a ranch in a humorous cow town, and only cards from your own ranch have any effect for you. The game consists of a series of card plays in which players try to accumulate the most points and form the best poker hands by playing valuable cards, making good choices, and winning tricks called &quot;Gunfights&quot; and &quot;Roundups.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

You're a Roman statesman struggling to survive in this era of cultural decline and political chaos. While foreign invaders and domestic incompetents devour the last resources of the Empire, you'll try to build your career out of the rubble. You start in Rome, and the Visigoth starts on the outskirts of a spiral board. Each turn, you play and purchase cards that produce resources and give you special effects, as well as allowing you to move further out from the doomed Eternal City. Then the Visigoth moves toward Rome, destroying your cards... unless you spend your precious resources to bribe him. When the Visigoth reaches Rome, or a player reaches the outskirts of the empire, the game is over and the player who has fled the furthest from Rome wins.&#10;&#10;"

The players must then answer a question correctly to move again, each time claiming the square and value.  Once all the squares are claimed, the points are added and the player or team with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Some sample questions: (1) What does the Yiddish word &quot;nosh&quot; mean?

13301,,"Description of the game play from co-designer Michail Antonow:&#10;&#10;The board shows the Caribbean in the 18th century. Six pirate ships lie in wait on sea, ready to pillage the rich ports or to rob the booty from other ships.&#10;&#10;The sea is divided into spaces. Each player is in possession of three safe havens, marked in his color on the board. If only two or three players are playing, the safe havens in the vacant color(s) are treated as normal sea spaces.&#10;&#10;The aim of each player is to lure the pirates to deliver treasure crates to one of their own safe havens, and not to the safe havens of the opponents.&#10;&#10;The pirate ships do not belong to any player. That is why the players must bribe the pirates each time they want a pirate ship to act on their behalf. And what is the greatest temptation for a Caribbean pirate? Rum of course, barrels full of rum!&#10;&#10;In every round the players try anew their best to bribe the pirates. The player who has offered the most rum to a ship gets to move that ship as many spaces as the number of barrels shown on the bribing chip. An active ship can (a) rob a crate from a port or from another ship, (b) reach a crate over to another ship, (c) swap crates with another ship, and/or (d) deliver a crate into a safe haven.&#10;&#10;The aim is to have the most doubloons at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"

13308,,"Niagara is set in the not particularly safe world of rushing waterfalls. In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.&#10;&#10;The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the falls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home. Niagara is distinguished by an innovative movement mechanic as well as a beautiful three-dimensional rendering of the waterfall setting.&#10;&#10; Expanded by: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Niagara: Diamond Joe&#10;     Niagara: The Spirits of Niagara&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Up to seven players may play.

One or more players have characters journeying through the Tower. Unlike the other two entries, this game did not include counters or a map.

13314,,"The June 6, 1944 Allied landings in France were an overwhelming success. With more men and material landing each day, the growing power of the American and British forces should have resulted in a drive inland -- but three weeks after the landings, the shallow beachhead had only expanded slightly. There was growing concern that the bloody fighting of the First World War might be repeated.&#10;&#10;British forces should have captured the city of Caen, just 15 kilometers from Gold Beach, on the first or second day of the invasion. British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, faced great pressure to secure the city and tie down German mobile forces while the Americans captured the port of Cherbourg. But a direct attack on the city itself failed at the cost of many Canadian and British lives.&#10;&#10;Next the British attacked west of Caen, where a successful advance might outflank the city and force a German retreat: Operation EPSOM, an attempt to gain by maneuver what could not be taken by assault. British divisions, fresh to war but having trained for years, faced the feared SS troopers of four panzer divisions. Both would soon learn the harsh realities of war in the hedgerows and fields of Normandy.&#10;&#10;Although Montgomery in the end did not force the Germans to abandon Caen itself, he did draw the German armor onto the British Army, who both tied it up and ground it down. The whole purpose of sending I and II SS Panzer Corps to Normandy was to drive the Allies into the sea. Steady British efforts forced the commitment of the armored formations as they arrived on the field and so depleted them that no coordinated German offensive was ever launched.&#10;&#10;Beyond Normandy is a Panzer Grenadier game covering the British operations from the end of June to the middle of July and the German reactions to them. Three maps (two 22&quot; x 34&quot; and one 22&quot; x 17&quot;) depict the actual battlefield at 200 meters a hex and include individual bridges, villages, tracks, roads, hedgerows and church steeples.&#10;&#10;The 583 playing pieces represent leaders, infantry and tank platoons and artillery batteries. They include the weapons employed by British infantry and armored brigades and German SS and Wehrmacht panzer and infantry divisions. New British tank types include the Churchill, Cromwell and Firefly tanks, the flame-throwing Crocodile, and the bomb-throwing AVRE. The Germans bring tough SS grenadiers, Panther tanks and more.&#10;&#10;The game includes 39 scenarios and 5 &quot;super&quot; scenarios (combining two or more of the scenarios into a large-scale operational scenario).&#10;&#10;This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to run up your opponent&rsquo;s score, while completing your own round in as few strokes as possible.&#10;&#10;Par Fore the Course is an indoor game designed and developed by golf professionals to simulate the thrills and excitement of actual outdoor competition. As much as possible, Par Fore the Course is played the way real golf is played. But there&rsquo;s added excitement, because Par Fore the Course goes beyond the gentlemanly rules of the Royal and Ancient Game. In this competition, if you play a shot that lands you in trouble, your opponent does not stand back politely while you escape from your predicament. No! He gleefully drops you into a lot deeper trouble! And you do the same to him!&#10;&#10;To start, cut the cards and the low card becomes the dealer and also plays first, play then follows clockwise. Once all first shots have been played, the player furthest from the hole plays. When two players are the same distance, the player arriving first plays. Once on the green, continue to putt until in the hole. Winner of each hole plays first on the next hole. In case of a tie, the player who played first on previous hole plays first for the next tee.&#10;&#10;Begin each hole by drawing up to 5 cards to your hand. To begin par 3&rsquo;s roll 2 dice and to begin par 4&rsquo;s and 5&rsquo;s roll 3 dice. The roll of the dice determines your ball's landing point and do the following based on the par of the hole and where it landed:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If on the fairway - play a card trying to match the suit of the position you landed. Whether it matches or not will determine what happens next (water, sand trap, out of control, make it to the green, etc)&#10;     If in a sand trap &mdash; roll 2 dice (and/or play a card). The number rolled is the distance you are from the hole, unless doubles are rolled. In that case, the result will depend on whether you have a matching numbered card in your hand.&#10;     If in the water &mdash; count one penalty stroke. Then, move your ball to a drop area on the board represented by a circled D. Any numbered card can be played to the green. The number on the card represents the distance from the hole.&#10;     If off the fairway &mdash; You are out of bounds and count a 2 stroke penalty and roll dice again.&#10;     If on the green &mdash; you can putt. The number of the card played to make it to the green determines the distance to the hole. Roll dice to see if you putt into the hole.&#10;     If the number cannot be found - You have a lost ball. Count 2 penalty strokes and roll dice again. (Note: A number is missing on each hole. The missing numbers are: Hole #1&mdash;9, #2&mdash;12, #3&mdash;5, #4&mdash;10, #5&mdash;12, #6&mdash;12, #7&mdash;15, #8&mdash;13, #9&mdash;9)&#10;&#10;&#10;OUT OF CONTROL: &#10;&#10;     Your ball is considered OUT OF CONTROL if you don't have a matching suit card for your numbered location OR number is off the fairway, but not in the water, a sand trap, or out of bounds. In this case, the player to your left plays a card and it determines what happens to your ball.&#10;&#10;&#10;HOLE IN ONE:&#10;&#10;     When a player rolls two 1&rsquo;s and holds the Ace of the suit shown in the middle of the green, they score a HOLE IN ONE!&#10;&#10;&#10;SCORING: Each time a player rolls the dice from the tee or on the green, count 1 point. Each time a card is played either by the player or his opponent, count 1. At the end of each hole add penalty shots incurred to your score. Lowest total after 9 holes wins.
