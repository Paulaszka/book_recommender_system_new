The board shows a map of all the cities, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with two or three cities, and a large region with all the Bavarian cities in the center.&#10;&#10;Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may build only one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.&#10;&#10;Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card, and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn, a player will draw a card from a display of six, face-up city cards (or the top of the face-down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored, the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on their next turn.&#10;&#10;When a player exhausts their supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage, the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes their turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, then lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.&#10;&#10;"

Players are split into two &quot;football teams&quot; composed of a single &quot;coach&quot; and a number of &quot;players&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each &quot;player&quot; sits opposite a &quot;player&quot; from the opposing team, with all players of a team on one side of the table and their coach standing behind the rival team on the opposite side of the table so they clearly watch him.&#10;&#10;The board is composed by a &quot;football field&quot; gridded board, 2 small dice, 3 normal dice and some &quot;action cards&quot; showing the position that each wooden &quot;soccer player&quot; will have to reach in the field.&#10;In addition each team has 2 team-rose(?) cards and 8 full color wooden soccer figures with a number on the back and front.&#10;&#10;The prototype I tried contained 3 teams: Japan, Greece and Eastern-Europe. The soccer player names are quite hard to say because the author deliberately invented really strange and long names.&#10;&#10;To win you have to put the ball in the net more times than other team.&#10;&#10;The game is noisy and hilarious. Each coach gets an action card. Each player get a &quot;number&quot; that represent the t-shirt number of the figures they will control (more than one there are less than 14 players).&#10;&#10;Only the coach see the action card and have to call BY NAME (of soccer players not of the people playing the game) to indicate where to move to without talking, without indicating the wooden soccer players. The only way to communicate is to give him indications with his hands or miming something as real coach do.&#10;&#10;Every time a wooden soccer player is in the right position the coach scream &quot;PASS IT&quot; and so on the other wooden soccer player until the last is positioned and the coach screams &quot;SHOOOOOT!!!&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;All the players stop play. If the team is positioned exactly as the action card requires, the last player who moved a wooden soccer player for the team throws a die to score a goal.&#10;&#10;Some penalties are given to the coach for performing forbidden actions (like calling wooden soccer players by number or indicating it by pointing) and if the action card is not correctly reproduced.&#10;&#10;RETHEMED : HysteriCoach Hockey&#10;&#10;"

The game is played on a 36 by 36 grid with the Earth at the center.  Players get fuel cards numbered 1 through 10 to control their movement.  Each turn, you play one fuel card to move your ship that number of squares either horizontally or vertically, but not both.&#10;There are also two fuel ships.  Every player on his turn rolls a die and moves one of the fuel ships.  If you land next to a fuel ship, you can retrieve any one used fuel card.  When you are out of fuel, you can only move one square per turn. You also retrieve any 3 used fuel cards on every planet you land on.&#10;Each planet has a series of 10 to 12 dots that describe its entry/exit orbit.  To leave Earth, you have to follow the 12 orbit dots before you enter the vertical and horizontal grid of open space.  Likewise, when you want to land on a planet, you have to start on the outermost orbit dot and follow the orbit down to the planet's surface.  Sorry, no transporters in this game.&#10;&#10;"
