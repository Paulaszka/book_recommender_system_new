Both coaches have a draw deck of 10 cards. A card drawn from the top of the deck at the beginning of a turn, determines the number of movements points the coach will have available to move one or more players and/or to move the puck (be it by passing or by shooting the puck on goal). After the draw deck has been exhausted, the drawn cards are shuffled to form a new one. The match ends after the draw deck has been exhausted for the third time; so, after 30 &quot;minutes&quot; or 3 &quot;periods&quot; of play. The coach whose team has scored the most goals wins the game. If the scores are tied, the game can go into &quot;sudden death&quot; overtime, where the first team to score a goal will win the game.&#10;&#10;The game's movement system was inspired by Corn&eacute; van Moorsel's StreetSoccer but adapted to handle the difference in how a soccer ball can travel versus how a hockey puck can travel: more than one player can be moved on a turn; players can move with and retain possession of the puck; the puck travels in a straight line and it may only change direction if it comes into possession of another player who moves with it or passes it again or if it is deflected off the boards bordering the ice surface. The game also adds rules to permit poke-checking, body-checking, and assessing penalties.&#10;&#10;"

As with all fine fairy tales, there lurks a tricky troll in the background who would rather take over the beautiful Fairy Ring site for himself. A roll of the die can work in his favor, so players must figure out a strategy, using the fairy cards, to foil both the troll and lady luck.&#10;&#10;"

The board is a large hexagon, with its six sections colored to match the pyramids that will go on it - consistent with Chinese Checkers.  The line of hexes that forms the border between &quot;home&quot; territories is multi-colored, matching the adjacent home territories.  What makes E special is that it uses the natural size stackability of the Icehouse pieces to enhance Chinese Checkers significantly.  For one thing, pieces must move precisely as many steps and/or jumps as they have pips (i.e. Smalls go 1; mediums, 2; larges, 3).&#10;&#10;The major effect on play comes from the stackability.&#10;&#10;     A piece may never - not even for a step of a move - stack directly on its own color.  (except as the result of a guard exchange)&#10;     If you can physically touch your piece (without shifting things about), you may move it, even if that means pieces atop it will take a free ride.&#10;     If you can't physically touch your piece, it is trapped.&#10;     You may never trap a piece in its home territory.  The multicolor hexes come into play here, creating a somewhat safe zone for pieces.  The center space is safe for everyone.&#10;     You may liberate a trapped piece of yours, teleport a guard (a trapping piece of yours), and violate the &quot;never stack directly on yourself&quot; rule by performing a guard exchange.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game is otherwise exactly like Chinese Checkers.&#10;&#10;Game System&#10;&#10;    Icehouse Pieces&#10;&#10;&#10;"
