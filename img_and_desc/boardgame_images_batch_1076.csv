Based on the epic 1930 Himalayan adventure which ultimately failed to climb the third highest peak in the world, the game uses original photos and draws on Frank Smythe's book The Kangchenjunga Adventure, written almost 100 years ago.&#10;&#10;In the first part of the game the players recruit climbers and sherpas, and gather a range of other resources. These are all represented on the cards. This calls for a mixture of set-building and push-your-luck, as you aim to bring together the strongest expedition possible. Although the game is competitive, there are ways of helping each other too.&#10;&#10;The second part of the game sees the players making their final preparations for an assault on the summit of Kangchenjunga. Some cards may not be useable if the set isn't correct. Then the summit attempt begins and players take it in turns to advance up the mountain. Kangchenjunga is 28,156 feet tall, and successful players must achieve this. But whatever the outcome, details of the players' expeditions can be recorded in the 'Hall of Fame' at the back of the Almanac.&#10;&#10;Kangchenjunga works beautifully as a 'filler' game for a wide range of ages. Simple to learn, the game-play has surprising depths and re-playability is high. See the Rulebook and Almanac link below for full details of how the game plays.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Between 2 cards&hellip; Which image is repeated??? mmmm&hellip; I ALREADY SAW IT!&#10;&#10;You have to say it quickly, as soon as you found the match. The more attention you have, the easier you will see them! Hurry up, concentrate, wake up because in this game, speed rushes us and fun awaits us. If you take two cards and look closely, you will see that they always have one image in common (one and only one). So the goal of the game (in its 5 variants) is to find that common image between two cards and name them as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;1- Pile, Pile with challenges!&#10;A card with images is distributed to each participant and the rest are placed in a pile in the center, with the images visible. You must look for the common image between the card that touched you and the first of the stack. Whoever names the match first draws the center card and places it on top of their own pile. when a challenge card appears, whoever meets it first wins the indicated cards. The game ends when there are no more cards in the center of the table and whoever collects the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;2- Discard with challenges!&#10;Opposite of &quot;Stack, stack&quot;: a card is placed in the center of the table and the rest are distributed among those who play. Each participant has to find the common image between the card that is on the table and the first of their stack. When the match is found, it quickly drops it on the table, discarding itself. Whoever runs out of cards first wins. In this variant they also play the 4 challenge cards, each time a participant reveals one of these cards, they must read it aloud to the rest... So everyone participates!&#10;&#10;3- The jersey (without challenges)&#10;In the center of the table 9 cards are placed face up. The jersey is assembled by finding the same image on three different cards. Whoever forms them first and names the image that matches, takes all three cards (which must be replaced so that there are always 9 cards on the table). Once the cards are finished, whoever collected the most wins.&#10;&#10;4- Take it yourself! (no challenges)&#10;Each participant receives a card face down. The remaining cards are placed in a stack face up in the center of the table. Each participant has to find the common image between the card of the center and that of any participant (except their own). When the match is found, give the center card to whoever has the card with the match. Whoever keeps the most cards loses.&#10;&#10;5- Pass it fast! (no challenges)&#10;Each participant puts a card on the palm of his hand, in view of the rest. When someone finds the image in common between one card and another, he puts his own card on the matching card. Here nobody wins, but whoever keeps all the cards at the end loses.&#10;&#10;"
