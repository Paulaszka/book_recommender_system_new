The goal of the game is to collect 3 pieces in a treasure island. The game play is simple: the player throws the 6 special dice and put his pieces in the path. Captures are possible too, and the winner is the player that moves all 3 pieces to his island.&#10;&#10;A Sri Lankan race game for two players. It has elements of Ludo-type games, in as much that you both start with three men and you win by getting all three 'home'. The board is unusual, in that it is not a 'circle', rather it is a track of 31 spaces, with some spaces marked as castles and you are safe from being sent home on them.&#10;&#10;"

Still, if The Goonies taught us anything it&rsquo;s that size doesn&rsquo;t always matter, and I&rsquo;m happy to report that this is the case here. Though the board itself is only about half the size of your average game, it&rsquo;s actually a brilliantly colored fold-up printed on super sturdy laminated stock that appears perfectly capable of standing up to multiple years&rsquo; worth of play sessions. The same can be said for the game&rsquo;s Move Cards which, while not quite as brawny as most CCG cards, are thick enough to get the job done.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fairly simple and properly reflects the spirit of the source materials - players take the role of one of five Goonies (Mikey, Data, Mouth, Chunk or Andy) and use a three-card hand in an attempt to escape One-Eyed Willy&rsquo;s cave. Players disarm traps to collect Gold Doubloons, and the first to reach the &quot;Escape&quot; square with three such Doubloons wins the game. The process is complicated by a trio of tricky Skull Spaces (only one of which contains the necessary key) that must be passed to reach the exit. This is balanced out by a fun selection of Special Move Cards that allow players to switch places with or steal gold from opponents. While certainly not the most engaging board game experience in movie fandom, it does manage to channel the proper amount of nostalgia and charm in a small but effective package.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

With this new set of wargames rules, players can take on the role of these warlords and command their own armies on the tabletop. Written by the author of the popular Glutter of Ravens rules set, Dux Bellorum is an element-based system, where each base of figures represents 50 fighting men. Each player has a specific number of points with which to construct his force and can choose to a Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, or Sea Raider army.

An army usually has 6-12 units, and each unit is rated for Aggression (Attacks), Protection (Defence), and Cohesion (Strength) and is trained either as Shieldwall, Warriors, Riders, or Skirmishers (all of which operate differently in the game).&#10;&#10;Dux Bellorum armies are selected from following lists: Late Roman, Romano-British, Welsh, Saxon, Pictish, Irish, Land Raider, Sea Raider.&#10;&#10;"

The core game, designed by us at Project Good is the game of Good: the Battle. The uniqueness of Good: The Battle is it's ability to use any genre, any miniatures, anywhere, anything else...? Yes there is, but it's all Good...&#10;&#10;Unlike the heavily stat-based games that you see everywhere nowadays, Good: the battle turns these statistics  into two basic attributes; Good and bad. Obviously the better you are at things (shooting, close combat, healing, etc.) the longer you will survive in this world, but everyone has a limit of how much Good they can do. Nasty things like damage, curses, etc can only be described as Bad things, but sometimes a bit of bad is exactly what is needed.&#10;&#10;There are thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of character miniature manufacturers out there; and every single one of these can be used in Good: the Battle - regardless of scale, setting, period, race, etc. Good: the Battle uses the actual miniature to give you benefits in the game. For example; a miniature equipped with swords will be better in close combat, than somebody with none. A miniature carrying a rocket launcher will obviously do more damage if it shoots you in the head. Huge dragons will have more hit points, and mice will have less. But this doesn't mean a one-armed dwarf mute who's only weapon is a bag full of dead hamsters won't be able to put up a fight...&#10;&#10;"

It consists of two separate boardgames: &quot;Dada's World&quot;, which teaches about how to behave apropriately in given situations and answer questions about the guru's teachings; and &quot;Guess, Who Am I?&quot;, which focuses on identifying role models.&#10;&#10;Game 1 (Dada's World) - Players roll a die and move along a track which represents their journey through Dada's World, collecting rectangular plastic &quot;coins&quot; with a variety of point values. &#10;Landing on marked spaces along the track can either add points (Helped Poor Person: 100), subtract points (Killed a cockroach: -150), provide the opportunity to answer questions about Dada's teachings to earn points (Dadai Dhamaka), lose turns, take extra turns, go back to Home, and other similar effects. At certain points on the track, players have the opportunity to pay points to take a shorter route.&#10;The winner is the first player to make a complete circuit of the track and return to the start space with 1500 points or more. Players who complete the track with fewer than 1500 points must go back to an earlier square and try to accumulate more points.&#10;&#10;Game 2 (Guess, Who Am I?) - Players roll a die and move along a track collecting pieces of three separate puzzles. Most of the spaces on the board are marked with a statement associated with one of the three &quot;role models&quot; - Parents, Dadashri and Humanity. When landing on a space on the board, players must identify which role model is associated with the statement on that space (example: Space #17 &quot;We should bow down to them every day&quot; is associated with Parents). Correctly identifying the role model allows the player to take the puzzle piece associated with that space. &#10;Other spaces give the player a free random puzzle piece, allow the player to take a piece from another player, or cause the player to lose a turn. Players who reach the end of the track without winning the game move back to Start and continue to collect puzzle pieces.&#10;To win, a player must collect all 12 pieces of one of the three puzzles. He may then assemble the puzzle to see a picture representing one of the role models, then flip the pieces over to reveal a message.&#10;&#10;From the rule booklet:&#10;&#10;Hello kids!!!&#10;&#10;Time to enter DADA'S WORLD filled with excitement, fun &amp; learn.....&#10;&#10;This 2-in-1 Game Pack offer dual knowledge and fun, Get the tracks right from 'Home' to 'Simandhar City' and back 'Home' in Game 1.

The German armies in France had ceased being organized formations and were streaming back to the Reich in willy nilly fashion, hotly pursued by the Western Allied armies as they dashed through Paris and to the borders of Germany. The First US Army (with the Ninth later on), hit the Westwall on September 12th and was destined to slog through the mud and rain for months against the fortifications and surprisingly resilient German reserves hurriedly thrown against them in a desperate bid to keep the American army off as much German soil as possible. Additionally, lack of supply served to further restrain the American advance. Would the war be over by Christmas, or would the Germans pull off a second &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; and hold long enough to launch a counteroffensive in the west ?&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Decision Games website:)&#10;&#10;HURTGEN: Hell&rsquo;s Forest is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous campaign. The 2,240 counters in the game represent almost every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought in the battle, including US, German, British, and even Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider, and headquarters units are all fully represented in the counter-mix. The two map sections are an accurate representation of the battle area and were compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-1944 US Army map sources. The area portrayed shows all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain in relation to their suitability for armor and infantry, along with all the villages, towns and  cities that proved to be the bastions of the German defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn't be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.&#10;&#10;THERE are three main scenarios representing each of the offensive periods of September, October and November. A smaller learning scenario depicts the US 28th Infantry Division&rsquo;s ordeal as it attempted to drive on the Roer River dams through the forest of the area. Players may also play continuously from September to the first week of December (almost 300 game turns!). The big challenge for the allied player is to see if he can reach the Rhine River months ahead of the actual date, and shorten the war considerably. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.&#10;&#10;THIS latest edition of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (which began with Wacht am Rhein) presents further refinements to the combat, artillery and supply subsystems in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare at this scale. For example, rules for &ldquo;Lull&rdquo; periods have been added in order to allow players to speed up game play during periods of relative inactivity. These Lulls compress game play from three turns per day to one, allowing players to cover longer intervals of historic time. Other additions feature level-two entrenchments that allow the German player to create fortified bastions in German towns and cities that can better withstand Allied barrages and ground assaults, along with rules that represent the logistical nightmare faced by the Americans during much of the battle.&#10;&#10;THE orders of battle have been extensively researched in order to provide an accurate and functional depiction of the armies of both sides. The incredibly hodge podge nature of the resurrecting German army is shown through the depiction of the various rear area units and replacement army battalions that appear almost randomly throughout the game.&#10;&#10;GAME SCALE&#10;&bull; Map: 1 mile per hex&#10;&bull; Time: 3 Game Turns per day&#10;&bull; Units: Infantry and Artillery are battalions.

The Astronomer may choose not to move, in order to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; one of the opponent&rsquo;s Astronomers set in a neighbouring square.

The system takes away from Second World War and goes to Ancients. In 264 Roma was summoned to Messina by Mamertines mercenaries to help in their quarrel with Cartage, the main power in Sicily. Carthaginians count on Hiero the Tirant of Syracuse to help defeating the Mamertines. Here begins the First Punic War.&#10;Romans and Carthaginians fought for 22 year over Sicily and in North Africa. Rome emerged victorious and Cartage was obliged to quit his long standing presence in Sicily.&#10;The land campaign was a long string of Roman victories as city after city was subdued and every Carthaginian army was defeated in battle. Syracuse was forced to make an alliance with Rome and Cartage was left with only a few fortresses in the island.&#10;Anyway the war was won and lost in the sea. The war saw the emergence of Rome as a sea-power and a long string of naval victories allow Roman troops to menace even Cartage proper. Only to be saved by Xantipus and his mercenary army at the Bagradas Plains battle. Naval warfare played a prominent role in this war and will give Carthage Senate his las blow. Carthage tried to spend the Roman effort during the whole war. His strategy was of attrition and was unsuccessful; Rome never gave up a prize.&#10;The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map. It is designed for two players with one running the ROMAN forces and the other the CARTHAGINIAN forces -including Syracuse. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters. The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.&#10;The ROMAN player will be on the offensive during the whole game as he has to conquer the whole island to get victory. CARTHAGINIAN player focuses on spoiling Roman campaigns and plans with ambushes, sallies and bad weather cards. Also he has to recruit an army as he doesn&acute;t has any at the beginning of the game.&#10;The ROMAN player must plan his offensives carefully as he will need a new army and resources for each one. Also he will need to build a fleet his doesn&acute;t have at the start of the war. The sea contest will be evenly match and you better take into account bad weather as it sinks more ships than enemy action.&#10;Siege warfare takes a prominent role in this game as every city in the game map is a walled on with his own intrinsic garrison.&#10;Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward. Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience. We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;- 1 80x60 cm map of Sicily and North Africa.&#10;- two ten-sided dice&#10;- 176 unit counters&#10;- 1 Rules Book for the Series &ldquo;Campaign Commander&rdquo; and Exclusive Rules of &ldquo;Punic Island&rdquo;; historical and designer notes.&#10;- 70 cards (divided in two decks, plus help cards)&#10;- 3 plastic bags.&#10;&#10;"

The game includes one clockwork, strawberry board, 4 worm cards (1 blue, 1 green, 1 red and 1 yellow) and 20 green worms with coloured tail ends, 5 worms in each of the 4 colours.&#10;&#10;You set the game up by randomly placing the worms in the holes in the strawberry and then each player selects a colour.  The aim of the game is to be the first player to get all 5 worms in your colour.  There is a lever at the top of the board, pull it and release to make the worms start wiggling (you'll have to repeat this frequently throughout the game as it only lasts for 10 seconds or so).&#10;&#10;Once started players take it in turns, beginning with the youngest player, to grab a worm from the strawberry.  If it matches their card they keep it, if not they put it back and then the next player goes.  You keep going around until one player gets all of their 5 worms.&#10;&#10;This is a very simple kids memory game with a dexterity element as you try and grab the wiggling worms as they move up and down in the board.&#10;&#10;"

Clones are extremely disposable, and inflicting serious injuries and death upon the opponent&rsquo;s team is a major part of the game&rsquo;s strategy. A decapitation will add an additional ball to the arena which can also be used as weapon.&#10;&#10;In leagues and tournaments, each player generates a unique team that carries on from game to game. Clones who suffer injuries or death in the arena will have temporary to permanent reductions to their stats, but are easily replaceable between matches.

If you're challenged, you have to flick a token onto a chart; where it lands dictates your speed for the turn.
