9061,,Players alternately place and move triangles around a board. Each player's 9 triangles have a number (1-9) on the back. Neither player knows which numbers are where. Each player designates one number as his Devil's Triangle (without knowing where the triangle is on the board). Triangles are captured by being surrounded on 3 sides by enemy triangles or the board edge. The first player to capture 3 opposing triangles or to have his Devil's Triangle captured by his opponent wins the game.&#10;&#10;

9065,,"Richard Breese in Sumo 16/17/18:&#10;&#10;The Ko-An board comprises of thirty six octagonal green spaces, interlinked with twenty five square yellow spaces and surrounded by a red border. Each player has six octagonal and five square playing pieces and plays with either the black or the red pieces. To start the game each player's pieces are placed on the nearest two 'rows' to that player, on the spaces the same shape as the pieces. The object of the game is to get any one of your own playing pieces onto the opponent's back row.&#10;&#10;All the playing pieces can move onto either the octagonal or the squared shaped spaces, however they can only move forward, not sideways or backwards. It should be noted that as the squared shaped spaces do not touch each other, a player cannot move directly from one squared shaped space to another. In addition, octagonal shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on octagonal shaped spaces and squared shaped pieces can capture any of the opponent's pieces standing on square shaped spaces. Considering its simplicity, the game can develop in a surprising variety of ways. For example, pieces of both players may bunch up on one side of the board, several 'skirmishes' may occur all over the board, or a large stand off may arise across the center of the board. This variety adds to the attractiveness of the play.&#10;&#10;"

Dilemma has been designed to be played at a swift pace which calls for instant decision making, when players are faced with the Dilemma of attacking their opponents advancement or running for Home Base.&#10;&#10;Dilemma is unique, a completely new concept unlike any other board game. From strategies taken from the worlds leading board games, chess and backgammon, comes 13 years of development to create the fast-paced, quick thinking, adrenaline pumping board game Dilemma.&quot;&#10;&#10;In reality this is a dice rolling game seemingly targeted at children (Ages 7 and up). Two players have three kinds of pieces on an abstract board: Attackers, Beacons and Guardians. The Attackers are numbered 1 to 5 and each turn a die is rolled - the Attacker with that number may move. The Attackers take two steps each to surround a Beacon, which, when surrounded by three Attackers is destroyed and one of the Attackers teleports to another board to attack the opponents Guardian. You win by either surrounding the opponents Guardian by three Attackers in this manner of moving your Guardian to Home Base. The Guardian can move whenever you roll a 6. Alternately on a roll of 6 you may remove one your opponents Attackers from around one of your Beacons. On 6 you can advance or defend - this is apparently the dilemma.&#10;&#10;In this manner you roll dice, move, roll, dice, move until someone wins. The strategy content is literally zero and there seems a reasonable chance the game won't end at all (as it is less likely to roll the numbers needed to advance than to hinder your opponent).&#10;&#10;The pieces are elegantly cast out of soft plastic and the board is attractive in a spacey abstract kind of way.&#10;&#10;The game was published on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, and was probably never widely circulated in spite of the designers claim:&#10;&#10;&quot;Social Championships and World Championships are to be played using the same rules. The rules are: You must declare you are playing for the championship title. The best player over three games only is the champion. If you lose to the champion you cannot challenge again for twelve months, The only way you can challenge before that time is if the champ loses the title to another challenger, you may then challenge that champion. It is advisable not to play for the championship title until you are confident that you have played enough games to learn all strategies involved in winning the game. The longest title held by a champion (as at December 1994) is 23 challenges over 1 year.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Eighty-sixed, get it? Never mind.&#10;&#10;You must supply a movement token for each player, a counter for each player's score, and three six-sided dice. Roll three dice on your turn, and move into one of the rooms. Once you have entered a room, you roll the three dice again and refer to a chart for each room that gives you points or lets you draw a card.&#10;&#10;There is a stack of cards for each room, so that Fat Freddy's room can be different from Freewheelin' Franklin's Room, and both are different from the Living Room. Very important to the theme of the game.&#10;&#10;Sample card from Fat Freddy's room: &quot;You unwittingly puncture Fat Freddy's water bed, sending a torrent of water into the apartment below, and causing a COMPLAINT and giving you FOUR points.&quot;&#10;&#10;When three complaints have occurred, a RAID is the result and each player rolls the three dice to reach the exit. Those who do not are busted . It's reminiscent of the mechanic from Escape from Colditz.&#10;&#10;There are also three special guests to the party, represented by three special cardboard foldup pawns. The Movie Star, The Famous Author, and the Crashing Bore. You can use leftover movement (once you're in a room) to move these pawns. They block other players.&#10;&#10;You can also get three points for loitering in the hallway, which is the kind of thing that proves this was play tested.&#10;&#10;Actually, reading the rules now I'm not too sure how it ends or how somebody wins. But the artwork is cool and I remember enjoying it whilst simultaneously enjoying something else, if you know what I mean.&#10;&#10;"

Soon a new bishopric will emerge.&#10;&#10;La&szlig; die Kirche im Dorf is a strategy game for 2-4 players. By placing fields an abundant landscape emerges with fields of wheat and lakes that can be cultivated by the farmers and building sites on which farmhouses and churches can be built.&#10;&#10;Goal of the game is to become bishop. The player who attracts the most followers to his churches becomes bishop. This happens by building churches near farmhouses. Adjacent churches however compete for the favor of the followers. The number of collected followers thus fluctuates occasionally.&#10;&#10;

9133,,"When Dragons Fight is an operational level game on the hypothetical invasion of Taiwan by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) circa 2003-2004. The simulation is based on the premise that the PRC opens with a massive missile attack and is able to use their economic and military leverage to keep America out of the conflict. With no foreign power intervening, the PRC must conquer the island within 15 days or the Republic of China (ROC) wins. The war itself is conventional and fast-paced.&#10;&#10;The game is of low-to-intermediate complexity. The system covers a wide spectrum of modern operational warfare, including rules for amphibious landings, air mobility, and land and air combat. Victory is determined for the PRC by seizing a significant portion of the island's population centers, which would render Taiwan's continued existence as an independent country economically and strategically impossible. The Taiwanese win through denial of Communist Victory Points or the capture of the landing beaches.&#10;&#10;Units portrayed are mainly brigades and divisions, ranging from about 5000-10,000 men, and some 50-250 armored fighting vehicles in the mechanized units. The game map covers the entire island of Formosa (also known as Taiwan) with terrain types limited to clear, beach, mountain, cities &amp; large towns, rivers and highways.&#10;&#10;Originally published in Command magazine #54 (2001)&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;hex scale = 11 km per hex side to side &#10;time = one day per game turn &#10;strength = regiment/brigade/division sized units&#10;&#10;"

It is a corps-level simulation of the battle in Europe during World War II.&#10;&#10;Advanced ETO is much more than just another World War II strategy game; Advanced ETO is an accurate simulation of the war in Europe, with historically accurate forces and combat units! All of the game's combat units have been exhaustively researched for technical accuracy (derived from the actual military TO&amp;Es of World War II). The naval and air units have been meticulously recreated as well, reflecting the authentic performance and abilities of these implements of war.&#10;&#10;Better yet, Advanced ETO's production model is an exact duplication of the actual production figures from the Second World War, providing players with a genuine simulation of the industrial aspect of World War II in Europe. As such, Advanced ETO contains almost twice as many pieces as the original ETO (over 2200!), including new mechanized, mountain, commando and cavalry units, additional naval and aircraft types, more Generals and even Admirals. For you naval buffs; Advanced ETO now contains absolutely every capital ship that existed during World War II, including additional aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and raiders. Advanced ETO even includes numerous naval vessels that were planned but never completed-allowing the players some very interesting &quot;what if&quot; possibilities. If air power is your forte, Advanced ETO includes just about every type of combat air unit that saw action in Europe during World War II. This includes many of the rare types, such as the P-61 &quot;Black Widow,&quot; the Fw 200 &quot;Condor,&quot; Yak-9, Bloch 174, &quot;Defiant&quot; and many, many more.&#10;&#10;And that's not all!&#10;&#10;Advanced ETO has two new beautiful 23 x 34 inch maps that encompass all of Europe and North Africa-everything from the icy Arctic Ocean to the deserts of the Middle East, including over 38 nations and  territories, newly researched topography, additional cities and ports (such as Dresden, Leeds, Gorki, and even the Azores, just to name a few). Newly added technically accurate rail road lines, updated resource areas, plus additional rivers and lakes. Virtually every aspect of World War II in Europe is here. Best of all, Advanced ETO can be played as an exciting grand strategic game (from the beginning of the war to the end), or as one of the many quick campaigns or scenarios.&#10;&#10;"

The player reaching Kantschou first receives 6 gold, anyone in the next space receives 5 gold, and so on down to 1 gold. After the first scoring round, all players start together again at Kantschou. The first player to reach Daidu receives 7 gold, next space 6, then 5 and so on.&#10;&#10;Play is by matching cards from hand to requirements in next free space (e.g. one of each good or 3 cards the same colour). Caravans tend to leap frog forward, so one player's move changes the requirements for the next. In each turn, a player may move as often as they can match from their hand. For those really stuck with a poor hand, 1 gold will move your caravan one place forward, but only so long as they aren't the leading caravan.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, the active player draws one of five face-up cards or a random card from the draw pile to replenish their hand.&#10;&#10;The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

The Allied player controls the US Army Forces Far East command and the US Asiatic Fleet. The Japanese player controls the IJA's 14th and 16th Armies and the IJN's 3rd Fleet. The Allied player must disrupt the Japanese advance, inflicting unacceptable losses on his opponent and denying him use of the Philippine ports and airbases for as long as possible. The Japanese player must quickly overrun the Philippines, allowing his forces to be redeployed for the campaigns to come in the Netherlands East Indies and The Solomons/New Guinea.

The movie starred Christopher Lambert as the hero, Connor MacLeod; Sean Connery played his friend and mentor Ramirez; and Clancy Brown assumed the role of The Kurgan, Connor's most deadly enemy.  Three sequels were produced, and a television series starring Adrian Paul as Connor's dashing cousin, Duncan MacLeod.&#10;&#10;In Highlander: The Card Game 2nd edition, players assume the roles of Immortals like Connor, Ramirez, The Kurgan, and Duncan.

Players are missing many kinds of building material, which has to be traded with the other house owners. Thus one exchanges a door for a heating or a plug socket for a tap. In that way the house is gradually finished. But the game takes a twist, as a player has to set a column in his house whenever he throws a six with the dice. With the fifth six one receives the ceiling plate of his house and continues to build on the first floor. Whenever one player has the first house finished (after the completion of the first floor) the game  ends, but the finishing player does not necessarily have to have won. For each complete room the players get points, and whoever has the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Bau auf! is set in the former GDR and gives a funny insight with which problems people had to cope in that time, when they wanted to build a house.&#10;&#10;"

If a player takes up a second small treasure card, he decides afterwards, which of the two treasures he keeps and which he gives to a fellow player, who still doesn't possess the appropriate card. Apart from collecting small cards, later in play players increasingly duel each other. If a figure reaches the field of an opposing figure they fight a duel, if they have the same kind of treasure. The aggressor chooses whether he would like to make a duel with or without treasure cards. In a duel without treasure cards each player throws a dice and adds its result to the value of his figure. The attacker wins, if he has a higher total result than the defender. In the duel with treasure maps the attacker selects a treasure sort, which both players possess. The opponents uncover their treasures, and add the result of a dice throw and the value of the figure. The attacker wins again, if he has a higher total result than the defender. The loser is banished and the figure is again placed in front of the suitable entrance and must be brought back into play from there. &#10;The game is over, when all players possess the six different kinds of treasure. The small treasure cards are uncovered and the individual numerical values of each treasure are multiplied by the numerical value of the small definition cards. The player with the highest sum total wins.&#10;&#10;"

As the little fellows all have a sweet tooth, they even chase each other sometimes in order to get the biggest bounty for themselves. A turbulent dice game played inside the game box.&#10;&#10;"

9174,,"In the essential structure it reminds one strongly of MONOPOLY. The author team Donadoni/da Vinci inserted another whole set of details which make LEONARDO its own game.  At the beginning, each player secretly decides to which of the two groups of aristocracy (the Pope-faithful Guelfen and/or the emperor-faithful Ghibellinen) he would like to belong.  On some spaces event cards are drawn, and those give one group or the other a financial boost.&#10;&#10;There is a variant. It offers opportunity to the players to unite in guilds.&#10;&#10;"

9176,,"A gameboard is divided into 105 squares, the 49 center squares printed in grey. These are called the Field Squares. The 28 white squares immediately adjoining the field squares are called Entrance Squares or Corridors, 7 on each side of the board. The 28 outside squares are called Home Squares or Lodges, and are colored alternately to match the colors of the Players' Tokens. There are 28 Tokens, 14 of each color chosen.&#10;&#10;The object of each player is to reduce the number of his/her own Tokens to 2. This is done by forming rows of tokens, upon which all but the end tokens may be removed.&#10;&#10;"
