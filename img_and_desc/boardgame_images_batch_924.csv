Meanwhile the British must allocate reserves and airpower resources to slow down the German advance as much as possible by forcing the German player to pay heavier costs for their territorial gains.&#10;&#10;The game uses a number of novel mechanisms to represent the attritional combat of the First World War and has been ran at several events including Connections UK Conference.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;

In 1808, Sweden invaded Norway with the aim of capturing what was then a province in Denmark. In 1814, Sweden invaded again, this time encouraged by the Treaty of Kiel, which had given them control of Norway on account of Denmark being on the losing side of the war. Norway, in the meantime, had declared independence and written their own constitution. The result of the ensuing battles were a stalemate, but Norway, exhausted by warfare and starvation, had to accept a personal union with the King of Sweden as the Head of State.&#10;&#10;The game is a low-complexity wargame, with units representing companies of infantry, batteries of artillery and squadrons of dragoons and cavalry. The game map covers the border area between Norway and Sweden from Halden to Trondheim. The Swedish objective is to break the Norwegian lines and capture Christiania (Oslo) and Trondheim, the Norwegian objective is to prevent the Swedes from winning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

All moves and actions are open, and each player has broadly the same opportunities and options, so you win or lose on the strength of your choices not the roll of the dice. The gameplay involves very little luck at all, using dice to track hitpoints and available actions but not for rolling outcomes. With the addition of some randomly chosen items from the bag of holding, there's just enough luck to keep things interesting without overpowering the satisfaction of a well-executed strategy.&#10;&#10;Players control a party of adventurers, each of which is unique and useful in different situations. Their three to five abilities are given on a card, and their position on a simple linear track is marked with a token. A die placed on this token marks the character's hitpoints, which also control which of those abilities is available for use. In each round of play, each player selects a character in turn and then gets to use that chosen character, again in turn. This means the first player gets freedom of action, but the second gets more information to work with.&#10;&#10;So players must constantly balance offensive and defensive tactics while thinking about positioning and counter-moves. Characters have devastating spells and weapons but can only use their most powerful when on full health, or in a spectacularly fatal and final move. But beware - each party is also allied with a monstrous beast with its own unique skills that ramp up as the battle escalates.&#10;&#10;After all, knowing the game is only Half the Battle...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The Yongle Emperor constructed the fleet during a period of outward-looking expansion of Chinese influence overseas, and its commander was Admiral Zheng He. The maritime power of the Ming Empire was used for political purposes, not just for trade. The immense fleet was technologically far in advance of European counterparts until at least the 18th century. While it is purported by some that the fleet circumnavigated the world and discovered all its continents save Europe, the voyages certainly reached Calicut in India and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, while making landfalls in the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa &mdash; but on the landward side of the Empire, border troubles were always brewing.&#10;&#10;In The Ming Voyages, one player will be the Ming Emperor who is trying to complete all seven treasure voyages, in addition to protecting the Chinese borderlands from invading barbarians. The other player controls the three disparate barbarian factions who are trying to settle on the borderlands with China. Battles can occur in these borderlands, with players use their three dice to roll for triples, doubles, and singles that are better than their opponent's rolls. Reserved cards can be used for re-rolls.&#10;&#10;The game uses multi-function cards (as in The Cousins' War) to provide actions for players to reinforce their armies and attack the enemy and for the Emperor to complete voyages. Play of a card may provide an out-of-turn action for the opponent, so players must be careful of timing. Only the Emperor draws new cards. Players swap hands at the end of each turn, so the Emperor always knows what the Barbarian Overlord holds, and each player tries to exploit the out-of-turn actions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Each keyword starts with two &quot;shadows&quot;, or black stones. Each turn a player pulls a jewel from a bag and uses the color of the jewel plus a keyword to tell part of the story. The keyword they choose to use determines where they place the jewel, and the color of the jewel determines the next player.&#10;&#10;For example, if you pick a red jewel and then choose the &quot;Treasure&quot; keyword, you might say &quot;there's a legend that there's a giant ruby at the bottom of this cave&quot;.

You remove stones from the board by adding stones to keywords that already have three stones on them, so as the game progresses you'll have a choice between getting rid of shadows to get points directly or removing jewels belonging to other players to reduce their points.

Players can either use individually based 25/28mm figures or blocks of figures on one base, however, the rules do require the removal of figures so each unit should have at least a few spare figures for casualty removal. When units suffer hits figures are only removed after each suffers four &quot;kills&quot;, this means that great handfuls of figures are not removed with each volley. But ten or twenty percent casualties in a unit does represent significant damage and a significant risk to morale.&#10;&#10;The rules contain a detailed method of generating armies which includes the composition, weaponry and tactics of each unit in addition to the leadership qualities, experience and levels of training of each unit. &#10;The rules also include several sample armies that give players &quot;ready to use&quot; pointed-up forces for all of the main factions involved in the Civil War.&#10;&#10;As with the Father Tilly rules, the &quot;war-tokens&quot; are also a major feature of Bloody Kingdom and provide an extra layer of period feel and fun, adding such diverse elements as powder explosions, drunken generals, turncoats and court astrologers to the game. &#10;Finally, Bloody Kingdom includes an Edgehill scenario with detailed army lists, a map and unit cards for each of the units involved in the battle.&#10;&#10;So if you like a game that emphasises tactics, command, morale and a bit of fun and you like the English Civil War - Bloody Kingdom could be the rules for you, what am I saying - these are the rules for you!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

At first round, each player get 3 tiles from their pile and than draw one each subsequent round, maintaining 3 options to play at almost all time. In your turn, you must place one tile (considering that you cant extend the panel mor than 7x7 tiles away) and optionally rotate 90&ordm; clockwise another placed tile (only if the rotated tile is not forming a circle pattern yet). The turns goes until the 7x7 panel is created.&#10;&#10;You score one point creating circle patterns with absolute majority of your colour and 3 points if the circle created has only your color. You also score bonus points (1 for each circle) if the scored circle is created only by your pieces.&#10;&#10;Ar fisrt glance, Azzelij seems to be a simple tile placement, but as the game flows players faces lots of hard decisions to make: May I get a point or avoid another player to get a better position? May I close the 7 piece limit to stop opponents to grow at one edge or stay creating my pattern? May I risk to get a full-colored circle of mine or get two or more majority-only circle points?&#10;&#10;As the game flows, the decisions ar harder to take and the panel gets its 7x7 piece formation, that increases the difficulty and fun!&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;The second edition incorporates an expansion that was formerly only available as a print &amp; play. This expansion introduces task cards with patterns. Placing your tiles in a way that they form these patterns will score extra points.&#10;&#10;"
