237132,,"A card game for 2-4+ players in which each player represents a separate group of Preppers who are preparing for the end of the world. Players accumulate supplies and advantages in several different categories.  While this goes on players eliminate different end of the world scenarios until only one remains. The remaining scenario will favour certain types of stockpile categories which will determine victory conditions.&#10;&#10;There are 2 common decks: &#10;&#10;     Stockpile Deck: This deck contains 10 cards in each of 13 different stockpile categories: Weapons, Food, Animals, Vehicles, Plants, Knowledge, Medicine, Shelter, Trade, Water, Power, Cold and Equipment. Each category of cards has two cards each of values 3 to 7.&#10;     Scenario Deck: The scenario deck contains 20 cards giving a description of the stockpile categories advantageous in overcoming it (e.g. Zombie Apocalypse = Weapons x3, Vehicles x3)&#10;&#10;&#10;To start flip over all the scenario cards face up and spread them over the centre of the table so that all of them are visible.  The top 5 cards of the stockpile deck are also flipped.&#10;&#10;There are 3 stages: &#10;&#10;     Prepping Stage: Players take turns with to flip over the top card of the stockpile deck and take 1 of the face-up stockpile cards and put it face-down in their stockpile. Players can look at their own stockpile cards but not their opponents. Move to Scenario Stage if there are no more face-up stockpile cards. &#10;     Scenario Stage: Players take turns to pick one of the face-up scenario cards and put it face-down in a discard pile. When there is only one scenario left, it becomes the End of the World Scenario (EOTWS) and play continues to the scoring stage. &#10;     Scoring Stage: The EOTWS will list categories that receive a bonus card value multiplier. For example: if it is the Zombie Apocalypse, all your Weapons cards and Vehicle cards are worth 3 times as much.  For every category you have zero cards in, get -5 points. Your final score is equal to the total point value of all your stockpile cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

Then, look for a bonus move: Choose an axis through that piece, and sum the values of all pieces along that axis (including the one you moved, any of yours, and any of your opponent's!). Now you get to move your piece whose number matches that sum, and so on until you've run out of bonus moves. Finally, it's your opponent's turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone cannot make their opening move for the turn.

And so the legend begins . . .&#10;&#10;Building Babel is a card game for 3-6 players in which, working together, they try to successfully build the fabled Tower of Babel. In so doing players will also be trying to get more recognition for their efforts than the others do. Throughout the process God will be trying to stop them?&#10;&#10;All that is required is 1 deck of playing cards and a handful of markers/tokens for each player. The cards are considered to be of two types &ndash; &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; cards (2 to J) which are used to construct the Tower, and &ldquo;Act of God&rdquo; cards (Q, K, A) which disrupt the construction process.&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled and a hand of cards dealt to each player (hand size is determined by the number of players). The rest of the cards form a draw pile.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to play as follows:&#10;&#10;     The active player plays a valid &quot;Brick&quot; Card on the Tower. These must be placed in order. The base of the tower is a row of four 2s. Next up will be the 3s and so on until the top row is filled with the Jacks. There must always be at least two more cards on any uncompleted level below the one being played to. If a player completes a row in the tower, they place one of their tokens beside it. This will show who put the most effort into the project, come the end of the game!&#10;     If they cannot play a &quot;Brick&quot; card the active player must play an &ldquo;Act of God&rdquo; card (if they have one).  The effect of the cards are as follows:&#10;         ACES: The next player misses their turn.&#10;         QUEEN: The order of game play is reversed (e.g. from left to right.)&#10;         KING: The last &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; Card played is taken off the tower and is shuffled into the draw pile.  Additionally when the first King card is played all game related talking between players must stop due to confusion of the languages.  When the fourth King card is played the game is over! &#10;    &#10;     When the player has played their card (Brick or Act of God) they pick up the top card of the draw pile, their turn is over and play passes to the next player.&#10;     If they have no &ldquo;Brick&rdquo; or &ldquo;Act of God&quot; card to play the player must pass their turn. If the player was forced to pass their turn they cannot draw a card. On the turn after a player has passed, they may choose to shuffle up to half of their cards (round down) into the draw pile and replace them with an equal number then drawn from the top of the deck. That player's turn is then over.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play continues until the tower is completed or the fourth King appears at which point God stops the project.  In the event that tower is finished all players win, but the player with the most tokens beside the Tower is the big winner!  However, if the fourth King card is played before this happens then everyone loses but the player with the most tokens beside the tower is the biggest loser for have put so much effort into a failed project.&#10;&#10;"

They grew up to be gods and guardians of the biosphere. The siblings loved each other very much. They were strong of build and sharp of mind. Whatever they attempted, they succeeded with ease, and faultlessly. When the young gods had grown to adulthood, Artaois and Branwen bade them each create something to add it to their creation, so that it would enrich the world and populate it. And thus, the gods created six very different types.&#10;&#10;Time passed and the creations of the gods multiplied and spread without restraint across the biosphere.

Whoever would be the first to bring their population into accord with the biological order would be called &quot;Lord of Creation&quot; from thereon.&#10;&#10;In Biosphere, the player siblings each control groups of different populations (dubbed &quot;types&quot; in game terms). In each round, a percentage of the types goes extinct, then players receive and spend evolutionary points to make their types either larger or smaller, and more versatile or more dedicated depending on what they think is appropriate for the landscape (which is scaled based on the number of players) and the current state of the game. Reproduction, movement, and lifespan can all be modified by players during the game. If a player meets the right conditions, they can play one development card from hand, gaining benefits from this. Players then move across the landscape, reproduce, and fill the different terrains based on their positions relative to other players.&#10;&#10;How do the siblings prove their worth to Artaios and Branwen?

Treasure and danger alike await your warbands, as they travel through the waterlogged city in search of the shards of the meteor that struck down the once-mighty port city and drove it beneath the waves.&#10;&#10;Star-Struck City is a skirmish game, designed around playing with small warbands of 5-15 models on a 4&prime; x 4&prime; table loaded with terrain. Warband members advance, gaining new skills, equipment, and injuries as they survive the rigors of battle in this deadly locale.

The athletes had devolved into overpaid, drug-addicted illiterates. Desperate to find a new impact sport for the masses, the TV networks sanctioned a think-tank of programmers, machinists, engineers, military experts, and game theorists. &#10;Within two years, the game of Cyberball had been born.  &#10;     &#10;The whiny, mentally stunted athletes of football had been replaced by 18 feet tall gleaming robots, adorned with spikes and sponsor adverts. These robo-athletes did not complain, ask for more money, do drugs, or get arrested.....they just rocked! And rock they did. In little time, the Cyberball League far eclipsed the popularity of all other sports combined. The crunch of metal on any given Sunday combined with spectacular explosions garnered fans from every walk of life. Soon, the Cyberball League included dozens of teams from all over the world. The corporations pumped millions of credits into this monster they had created and reaped huge rewards.&#10;&#10;Now the year is 2072, and Cyberball is the most anticipated sport on the planet. All teams compete for the Cyberbowl at season's end, where the two top teams slug it out for the coveted 'Assassin's Cup'. As a Cyberball coach, it is your job to secure the best sponsors and coach your team to the promise land. The season can be grueling for a rookie coach. Use earned credits to your advantage and field the best players, while destroying other team's star players. Embrace the thrill of giant metal machines mauling each other. Become a Cyberball coaching legend!&#10;&#10;&#10;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            &#10;

Choose a sponsor, upgrade your players, and prepare for gridiron mayhem.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is to outscore and brutalize the other team to receive monetary bonuses from the league and sponsors. Football fans will find themselves right at home with this 2 player game. To win games, you must score touchdowns. Once in possession of the ball, the offense has six plays to diffuse the ball by either passing midfield or getting in the endzone. The ball gradually heats up: cool - lukewarm - warm - hot - sizzling - critical. If a critical ball is not diffused, it will explode at the conclusion on the play. If a robo-athlete is holding the ball, they will be obliterated. The game is 7 on 7 robot football with a colorful cast of characters. Here are brief descriptions of the deadly participants:&#10;&#10;QB - The offensive captain is the linchpin of any good team. Unlike other robo-athletes, the Quarterback has legs which allow for quick lateral movement, but not flat out speed. The QB's weakness is its dreadful lack of armor.&#10;&#10;RB - An outstanding combination of speed and armor. The Runningback is often the workhorse of the offense. Many coaches find that an upgraded RB becomes a scoring machine.&#10;&#10;PB - A new addition to Cyberball, the Powerback is gaining popularity across the league. Being able to run or pass the ball, make the PB an unpredictable asset.&#10;&#10;WR - Perhaps the greatest offensive threat on the gridiron, the Wide Receiver is a true speed demon. Although lightly armored, a WR speeding down the field with the ball is rarely caught.&#10;&#10;TE - Tight Ends are cheap to produce and make good supplemental blockers on the line of scrimmage. Some coaches are able to use TEs to good effect in a short passing game.&#10;&#10;LM - Lineman are the bullies of the gridiron. Their main responsibilities are to block along the offensive line and make tackles along the defensive line. On tracks, they are slow but very maneuverable.&#10;&#10;CB - The fastest player on the defense is the Cornerback. They are primarily charged with covering the elusive WRs and making an occasional blitz. What they lack in armor, they make up for with speed.&#10;&#10;SF - Safeties are equally good at stopping the run or covering the pass. With respectable armor and above average speed, a good SF can be counted on to stop the offense dead in their tracks.&#10;&#10;LB - The intimidator of the gridiron, Linebackers have very think armor and decent speed. Although able to cover short passes, these monsters are better at dominating the line of scrimmage and dismantling opposing QBs.&#10;&#10;Teams in the Cyberball league utilize sponsors to supplement their income. It is a symbiotic relationship. Teams make thousands of credits each season for slapping sponsor decals onto their robo-athletes. Sponsors get valueable exposure on national TV. Deals are struck between each game and it is not uncommon to see a team switch sponsors frequently. Each coach selects one sponsor before the game.&#10;&#10;This can be played as a stand-alone game as well as in season mode. In season mode, players can save up their money to buy bigger and better bots.&#10;&#10;"

Afterwards, the active player should point out all cards from one team-mate hand that are of the same type as at least one card from the selected row or column. For example: &ldquo;Here and here and here &hellip; you have the same cards like in this recipe&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, if all the cards in the cookbook are face down, then the queen is happy and all players win together. Otherwise the game is lost.&#10;&#10;To be a true master of the sweets, you need a lot of workouts.
