8220,,"A strategic level game covering the entire war from April 1861 through March 1865. Victory generally depends on the control of replacement centers located at the north and south ends of the mapboard.&#10;&#10;While Civil War was grouped with AH's &quot;Family/Social&quot; game line, it shared elements with their &quot;Tournament&quot; wargames of the time. The game was played on a hex map and a CRT was used to resolve combat. The primary distinction between Civil War and the Tournament series wargames is the use of pawns instead of counters. It appears that this was done in an effort to introduce casual gamers to the Tournament style games.&#10;&#10;Civil War was dropped from the AH lineup in 1963.&#10;&#10;"

8222,,"Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humorous card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.&#10;&#10;A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).&#10;&#10;If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.&#10;&#10;The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Monkey Business&#10;&#10;&#10;"

8229,,"In Nuggets (2003), players try to surround the &quot;gold mines&quot; (numbered cylinders) on an 8x5 grid board. On a turn, a player either places a numbered tile face down or places two fence sections on the board; these fences determine the borders of each claim, and each claim must be at least four spaces large. At the end of the game, all tiles are revealed, and each gold mine is awarded to the player whose tiles in that claim have the largest sum, with ties resulting in an equal division of points. Whoever collects the most mine points wins.&#10;&#10;Armad&ouml;ra (2013) uses the same gameplay as Nuggets for the base game, albeit with the players themed as orcs, elves, mages, and goblins on the hunt for dwarven gold. Armod&ouml;ra also adds advanced rules to the game, with each player receiving one reinforcement token and 1-2 special power tokens. Instead of placing a warrior or erecting palisades (fences), a player can place a reinforcement token on one of their warriors in a territory that's already filled, boosting the strength of that warrior by one. A player can use their special power before taking one of the three normal actions, with the elf shooting an opposing warrior in an unfilled territory (lowering his strength by one), the orc placing an additional palisade that turn, the goblin placing a second warrior (with this one being face-up), and the mage looking at the value of an already placed opponent's warrior.&#10;&#10;Pearlad&ouml;ra (2022) moves the gameplay to the water, with players now placing two pontoons or one diver on a turn in order to fence off parts of the sea, then use the strength of your divers to claim pearls. This version of the design includes the advanced rules, with slight tweaks to the previous powers from Armad&ouml;ra.&#10;&#10;"

On his turn, a player plays two cards in front of him (forming a bowling &quot;square&quot;), one from his hand, the other from either deck (in any sequence) --this is his score for this square.&#10;The two cards should not total more than 10 (a &quot;spare&quot;); if they do, the second card is a &quot;channel&quot; and placed in the discard deck.&#10;If the first card played is a Strike, the second card is ignored and discarded. If the second card is a Strike, however, it is again treated as a Channel.&#10;A Channel played first becomes a Spare if a Strike or 10 is played second. A Channel played second is a Channel.&#10;The 10 is a Spare if preceded by a Free (which otherwise replaces any other card); a 10 can be discarded when played second. A 10 played first forces the second card to be discarded and scores zero (two Channels).&#10;A square of 6-9 deducts 10 points from one's score.&#10;A perfect game scores 300 points, hence the name.&#10;&#10;"

Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.&#10;&#10;After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.&#10;&#10;Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players.

If the hunter lands on a treasure token, he may take it and score between 3 and 5 points. If your ghost lands on the other players hunter he is bumped back to the starting area, which sometimes saves you some running.&#10;&#10;When the last treasure is collected the game ends and the one who scored most on his treasure wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each round consists of an Auction Phase (one auction) and an Action Phase (executing one or several actions on the board). After every Third Round, a Scoring Round occurs. Power Cards are awarded, according to the distribution of Agents in each Site. Some of these Power Cards award a single Victory Point, which is needed to win the game. After 3 Rounds, the cycle begins again. The game ends immediately, if a player acquires the required number of Victory Point Cards or if, after a Scoring Round, there aren't enough new Power Cards to place 3 Power Cards for each Site. The game is a compelling race against the clock, as the players struggle to choose the right Auction Cards, effectively distribute their Agents on the game board, and win Power Cards that allow them to execute special actions early in the game (often, confounding teams of rival Agents), and award Victory Points later in the game.&#10;&#10;"

An Oscar winning game if there ever was one. Basically, you and the other players are stuck in an abandoned farming community, hunted by a psychotic 21 year old with 10&quot; metal blades bolted through her fingers. The game play is very gory, the odds are in Angel's favor, and you must often fight with weapons no better than a flashlight. (Or a rake if you get really lucky..) However, that's the fun of the game! You see, the point of Death Angel isn't really to &quot;win&quot;, but to survive. Face it; Angel is better. She can appear and disappear at will, she's always got a deadly weapon, and worse of all, she regenerates almost instantly. Lucky for you, she does play fair; if you out run her, she might leave you alone. If you do something silly like jump through a window, she'll go away. (If you survive the fall, you can rejoice!) If you hit her too hard, she'll disappear. (Of course, next time you see her, she's going to be pretty peeved at you.) And finally, if you survive until 5AM, she'll allow you to continue your life in peace. And so, the primary goal is not to defeat Angel, but to survive her wrath. I wouldn't bet money on surviving all 6 hours, though. Expect to lose 2, maybe 3 victims before daybreak...&#10;&#10;"

There are also bypasses on the board. The unlucky passengers stopping there, must get off the train and wait for the next free wagon available which passes the loading point.

To make progress in the game you must form a coalition with at least one other player, but to actually win requires betraying your coalition.

(Each player starts with seven of a unique color.) Each play reduces your stockpile by one chip, and it is replenished through captures or gifts from other players. Players have some measure of control over who plays next, but captures either benefit another player or require that another player chooses to let you make a capture.&#10;&#10;Players may form any non-binding agreements provided that all discussion is done at the table.  Working together allows players to capture chips and force other players out of the game.
