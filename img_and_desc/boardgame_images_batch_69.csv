They form a Rescue Team working together to save themselves and as many of the Survivors as they can. Dwindling Fuel &amp;amp; Food, roaming Sharks, fatal Rock formations, Survivors drifting further &amp;amp; further away...all add up to exciting game play. There are many variations on how the game can end. The best of all scenarios is when everyone is saved &amp;amp; we get our Lifeboat safely to an Island. Stay alert and keep stout hearts! Rescue work is a dangerous and demanding job.&#10;&#10;"

7885,,"From the box:&#10;&#10;A game about communal living. We try to develop a happy, complete village. There are hardships and opportunities. There are Bad Feelings to handle with Love and Forgiveness. The Meeting hall is the heart of the community. If we succeed in building a community, we all win together. A medium-complicated game that explores both material and spiritual values.&#10;&#10;The Game of Community: the non-competitive game based on the principle of co-operation.&#10;&#10;Build a community together, work through hardships together, develop your resources together. Play together, not against each other.&#10;&#10;Players cooperate in this draw-cards-and-move game, moving around a track, collecting resources and trying to supply enough resources to recreation, industry, necessities, education and inner life to create a complete community. The game also uses event cards including love, unity, work, plain-speaking and bad feeling cards, which players accumulate.&#10;&#10;Depending on which variants are used, the players can lose, unlike some co-operative games. This can happen if the players don't have any resources to pay for a harmful event, or if all the players are immobilized.&#10;&#10;Players: &quot;4 are ideal, but more or less can certainly play and sometimes a very exciting game can be played with ten.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

A roll of a 6 allows you to send a Gangster to prison, and there is always room there. Or you can break a Gangster out of prison and send them to another player's hand. A round is played until one player disposes of their last gangster, and all other gangsters left in hand are worth negative points.

Each Game-Turn represents 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;During play, each player moves one or more spaceships about the game-map using a maneuver system that abstractly simulates the laws of Newtonian motion.

The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play.
