The game lasts 10 rounds in a ring of 36 squares, randomly initialized with numbered chits. In each round, players move their boxers like a chess knight, removing the numbered marker from the square they left.  The boxer who moves onto a higher numbered square wins that round.  Being unable to move causes a knockout loss.&#10;&#10;Folko-Boks was included as a free game in issue 4 of the Polish board gaming magazine &#197;&#154;wiat Gier Planszowych (&quot;World of Boardgames&quot;) published December 2007.&#10;&#10;The game acknowledges some inspiration from an earlier game by Sid Sackson, probably Paper Boxing.&#10;There is a somewhat similar game Joust on an 8x8 grid.&#10;&#10;"

On a player's turn, he lays one card face-down on the table, adds the number on that card to the sum announced by the previous player (if any), then announces the new sum; the player can play any card and state any sum, as long as it's not higher than seven. The next player has the option of playing a card (under the same circumstances) or calling the previous player's claim. If he does this, reveal all of the cards and sum them, with action cards counting as zero. If the claimed sum is correct, the doubter draws two cards from the deck and starts the next round; if not, the previous player draws two cards &mdash; even if he played honestly on his turn.

It is a family/party game which mocks the madness that takes hold of the &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; world just before any big gift-giving holiday. The items are titled such as &quot;all types of USB cables&quot; and &quot;precious jewels for pets&quot;. The game was published just before Christmas and the board design closely resembles the logo of one of the leading chain of malls in Estonia. Unfortunately the game is available only in Estonian.

To begin with, they are truly indie DIY performers and will be handling their own career and trying to book performances for themselves and win over fans.  As they progress, they may hook up with special persons like publicists and accountants and managers to be part of their entourage and help them achieve more success.  &#10;        &#10;There are several aspects of each jester's career which they will be working to advance over the five week Season of Mirth; Popularity, Wealth, Mojo, Reputation and Satisfaction. Jesters will also need to develop their material and save some of their best stuff for the big Woodshtick Festival at the end of the month, where all jesters are rated against each other and have the potential for a big payoff.&#10;&#10;All of the wealth, fame and reputation in the world won't mean a thing if a jester can't get no satisfaction.  Jesters is ultimately won by the player who generates the most Satisfaction.  There are several ways to gain Satisfaction in the game; through great performances, through the support of people in your Entourage, and by having a lot of fans at the Festival.  Satisfaction Points can also be lost, through bad performances or other circumstances.&#10;&#10;Jesters is played over five turns, each representing one week, with a final Festival performance at the end of the fifth week.  The game combines action drafting, hand management and area majority and plays in about 75-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;"

Its team of developers may end up being stuck in an endless loop cycle between the time it was first activated (4 minutes ago), the time it was first launched (now) and the time it can be relaunched (4 minutes into the future).&#10;&#10;Time and player movement is kept track of on a board depicting one minute intervals between the first activation and the second launch. Gameplay involves players drawing and placing numbered/colored hexes. At the beginning of the game, before the first time machine launch, a line of hexes is laid out to create the sequence of events that led to the time machine being built. Then, after the first launch, each turn uses a new hex sequence where players try to recreate the sequence of events that created the first launch while also &quot;fixing&quot; it just enough to make it work correctly and hopefully break them all out of the loop. One aspect of the gameplay uses actual one minute time measures as part of the process.&#10;&#10;Adding to the challenge, each time a player goes back in time, there is another one of them added to the game (depicting someone from the present traveling back in time and encountering themselves in the past). A light/dark color scheme is used to distinguish the present/past player tokens (dark blue/light blue, dark green/light green, etc.).  Each new version of a player adds abilities and also causes potential problems, and there is a limit to the number of multiples a single player can have before the time line is destroyed beyond repair.&#10;&#10;Play is cooperative, with a special commendation for the team member(s) who had the biggest part in fixing the machine.

This showdown determined that the Nationalist forces of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-Shek) would be driven from the mainland into exile on Taiwan. It was the culmination of 20 years of on-again-off-again civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists.&#10;&#10;In 1946, the eight-year-long truce between Nationalists and Communists that had held together during the War of Resistance against Japan finally broke down. Both sides raced to seize cities and rail lines in China formerly held by the Japanese. By November, 1948, the Nationalists had suffered severe reverses in Manchuria and the north. The Communist leadership decided the time had come to move into central China, so they targeted the area around the strategically crucial city of Xuzhou, about halfway between Beijing (Peking) and Nanjing (Nanking). The result was an enormous battle of annihilation that involved over half a million fighters on each side. The Communists also mobilized as many as five million peasants to help move supplies.&#10;&#10;This is very much an Against The Odds! situation: The Nationalists are well-armed with air support, artillery, road mobility, and tanks. And yet it is the Nationalists who are going up &quot;against the odds&quot;! Despite their material superiority, most Nationalist units have morale so low that &quot;defectors&quot; from their army are the main source of replacements for the Communists! The Communists are light, lean, and very well-motivated. The battle develops asymmetrically between the powerful but ponderous Nationalists and the mobile Communists.&#10;&#10;Designed by Earl Dixon, Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 features a map drawn to 20 kilometers per hex, with one week turns. There are over 150 unit counters and markers. Units are mostly Nationalist &quot;Corps&quot; and Communist &quot;Columns&quot; of about 20,000-30,000 soldiers. There are also artillery regiments and tank battalions: the Communists have a few; the Nationalists have a lot more. Both sides are subdivided (as they were historically) into &quot;sub-commands.&quot; The rules cover unique aspects of this struggle: Nationalist Defections, Communist Guerrillas, the Propaganda Offensive, Communist &quot;Short Attacks&quot;, Communist Re-Education, Red Militia, Nationalist Final Defense Positions, and more. Players may discern the early origins of the ferocious Red Chinese attack against UN forces in Korea a mere two years after this battle, as well as elements of guerrilla warfare that later became familiar in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;Virtually unknown in the West, this battle is quite familiar to mainland Chinese and to those on Taiwan as well. It's a fair description to call it the &quot;Gettysburg&quot; of the Chinese Civil War.&#10;&#10;"

Most other scholars however disagree that this is the same as the Irish game which was played on a 7&times;7 grid.&#10;&#10;Two opinions exist among those who maintain that the name Gwyddbwyll refers to a purely Welsh game. The Wikipedia Gwyddbwyll page describes chess at the top of the page, and this game below, referring to it as Gwyddbwyll Geltaidd to avoid confusion. It notes however that the game is properly called merely Gwyddbwyll, the longer name meaning merely &quot;Celtic Gwyddbwyll&quot;. This website also shows the initial set-up and gives a brief but incomplete description of the game in Welsh. The game according to this opinion is played on 9&times;9 grid and the object for the defending player is to get the king to a corner. Rules are otherwise presumably like Brandubh.&#10;&#10;The alternative opinion that the game was played on a 7&times;7 grid is described at Celtnet.

If a player is unable to do so, a card must be taken into the hand from the stock of cards not dealt.
