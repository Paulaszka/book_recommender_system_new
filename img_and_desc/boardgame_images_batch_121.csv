The dice may not be turned over. On his turn each player takes any die (of either color) and places it onto the board. There are several different types of lines that will win the game (all white, all black, all matching the color of the spaces they are placed on, a straight, all odd, all even), so you have to be very careful to watch for all the possibilities so that you don't set up an easy win for your opponent. Because the distribution of numbers will be different from game to game, you have to change the way you play accordingly.&#10;&#10;"

Only a tenacious German defense-in-depth and an equally devastating counterattack employing the new, then-secret infiltration tactics, prevented the British from making a decisive breakthrough.  Despite this setback, Cambrai was the forerunner of the mobile warfare of the Second World War.&#10;&#10;Now, THE FIRST BLITZKRIEG: CAMBRAI, 1917 allows you to recreate this battle, one of the most significant in military history.  Two players, each taking on the role of one of the historical commanders, use the Mapboard, 72 unit counters, and complete rules of play, to either change or recreate the historical results.&quot;&#10;&#10;Description of Game Components:&#10;&#10;Game Consist of a two color map, 72 (3/4&quot;) counters and rules of play.  No indication of scale is given in the rules.  Map is 17 hexes from West to East and 16 hexes from North to South.  Cambrai is located in north-east (upper right) corner of map  and the town of Sorel-Le-Grand is located in the south-west (lower left) corner of map.  Game is 17 turns in length.&#10;&#10;Rules are printed on both sides of single 18&quot; x 16&quot; sheet of paper.  Rules include 13 &quot;Variable Historical Options&quot; that can be used singly or in combination to offer a &quot;virtually limitless amount of scenarios.&quot;  Each option changes a historical factor in the game and include: &quot;British Develop Infiltration Tactics&quot;, &quot;General Harper Fragged&quot;, &quot;Improved Tanks&quot;, &quot;Germans Forewarned&quot;, &quot;French Participation&quot;, &quot;Cavalryman's Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Free Setup.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hex Movement system, IGO-UGO sequence of play (with addition of tank attrition phase for British player.&#10;&#10;Combat Results Table is Odds Based and consists of a separate table for each type of attack (Standard, Mobile, Probing or Surprise).  A 3-1 attack on the &quot;Standard Attack&quot; table results in a 33% (1,2) chance of a Defender Eliminated result, a 33% (3,4) chance of a &quot;counterattack&quot; result in which the defender has the chose of retreating 1 hex or counterattacking one of the hexes the attack was launched from, and a 33% (5,6) chance of a an Exchange result.&#10;&#10;From the Game Notes:&#10;&#10;&quot;CAMBRAI, 1917 is a see-saw battle.  The British have the advantage for the first three turns, but then it begins to slip away.  The German commander than has the opportunity to stabilize the situation and seize the initiative with his counterattack.  Therefore, the German should not give up if things look bad after the first few turns.  The situation can change drastically every turn until the end of the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Along the boundaries of each sector are printed Time Factor Numbers.  These numbers indicate the movement cost to a military unit crossing the boundary from one  sector on the opposite side of the Time Factor Number.

Finally, note that diagonal movement costs more than horizontal or vertical movement, because greater distances are involved.&quot;&#10;&#10;In other words, the map consists of squares with the cost to cross a side or corner of the map printed on the boundary.&#10;&#10;Each sector (square) measures 500 yards.

From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. The French leadership were divided into two schools of thought. The traditionalists believed that the Habsburg dynasty was the primary threat to France's position in Europe, and that the main thrust of the war should be made against their possessions in Italy and Germany. The other school feared the rise of the Maritime Powers (England and Holland) and counseled a hard blow in that direction. CoE looks at the five years that the French spent in the Low Countries attempting to smash the ring of enemies surrounding them.&#10;&#10;Even though the French, thanks to the sublime leadership of their German-born Marshal, Maurice de Saxe, conquered Belgium and invaded Holland, defeating every army sent against them, the campaigns resulted in a draw. The subsequent peace merely restored the status quo. The stage was then set for the titanic Seven Years War.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, there is great scope for you as the King's Captain General. The armies involved were the largest yet seen on a European battlefield &amp;#8800; the French fielded over 200,000 men, and the Allies tried their best to match them. The region is relatively compact, yet difficult to operate in, with the open country thickly studded with fortresses and cut by rivers. Seaward are tracts of swamp and fenland. On the other flank are the dense woods and rugged hills of the Ardennes.&#10;&#10;The French player, with the strategic initiative, must constantly press forward, laying siege to town after town (and leaving many men idle in garrison), as he seeks to lever the Allies away from the French frontiers and ultimately threaten the Allies' own bases of operation. The Allied player must decide whether to defend everywhere, to bide his time and harass the enemy, or to launch an offensive of his own. Even if he makes the right choice, however, he must still get the agreement of all the nations under his command&#10;&#10;"

When you have 3 matching cards in your hand, you lay them down, then draw a Point Card and place it face up on the set.

Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.&#10;&#10;Carthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).&#10;&#10;Carthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.&#10;Carthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby.

Some of the items discussed relate to current Vehicles and Weaponry(circa 1992), while others are quite fanciful in their conceptualizations. There are even a few that look to be 'lifted' from some other 'genres', and they've made an attempt to find a 'niche' for them within this. They have even provided &quot;Unit Organizational Displays&quot; that allow for several individual 'Units' to comprise a much larger one. For some of the 'Weaponry', you'll need to provide a 'Status Sheet' of your own making, but they do provide a general 'diagram' of how to go about accomplishing this. One other item of note- there are numerous 'narratives' that are used to give some sort of more descriptive idea of what is being portrayed. And lastly, there is a means of using another 'product' from this publisher(namely &quot;Assault on Kuwait City&quot;) with these 'Rules', which is mostly just using the game's counters &amp; mapsheet from that.&#10;&#10;"

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.&#10;&#10;The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Thebes&#10;&#10;&#10;"
