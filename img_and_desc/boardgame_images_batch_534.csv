Many become disillusioned, discontent even, and turn to pirating the prosperous trade routes between the five planets, much to the regret of the colonies' leaders, who have great need of the trade income in order to advance technologies and create jobs for the newly-arrived colonists.&#10;&#10;Colonies is a game of resource management in the far reaches of space in which the players compete to dominate in trade, politics and technological development. Each player controls the administration of a planet with access to a unique resource. In order to win you need to collect the most colonial credits by trading resources, upgrading your technologies, keeping your trade lanes free of pirates, and perhaps pushing the council's decisions in the right direction.&#10;&#10;At the begining of each turn, players receive an income of their own resource. The council meets each turn to vote on how to handle an occurring event. The outcome can reward those willing to put in an effort or punish those who are not. Players may do well to form alliances in order to sway the vote in a favourable direction.&#10;&#10;The resource income and the colonists that arrive each turn &ndash; sometimes in large numbers, sometimes in small &ndash; are used to make advances in five areas: Community, Military, Commerce, Influence and Industry. Following the council's vote, players take turns to either upgrade these areas or activate one of them to grant asylum to pirates in exchange for resources or hunt them for bounty, sell resources for Credits, make trade agreements more beneficial, or produce additional resources. When everyone has had three such actions, the players receive and pay resources according to the trade agreements, and any colonists that players have failed to employ turn to piracy, preventing players from getting income from their trade agreements next turn unless preemptive action is taken.&#10;&#10;Colonies lasts ten turns, with players earning victory points (VPs) from colonial Credits and technology advances. In the end, the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;"

The dealer begins the first trick of the game; after that, each trick begins when the last player to take a trick takes the top card of the deck, places it face-up on the table, and announces its value. Starting with the player to his or her left, and proceeding clockwise, each player must play a card from his or her hand on the trick, calculate the sum of all cards in the trick, and announce the sum.&#10;&#10;Card Values: 2 through 10 are worth their face value. Aces are worth 1 or 11 (declared when played). Jacks are worth 0 points, Queens are worth -2 points, and Kings are worth -4 points.&#10;&#10;If the sum is less than 21, play continues normally. If you bring the sum to exactly 21, you take the trick. If you push the sum over 21, the player to your right takes the trick, for forcing you to exceed 21. When you take a trick, add one to your score, and gather the cards from the trick into a pile face-down in front of you. Once taken, the cards from a trick may not be looked at.&#10;&#10;All hidden rules are also in play. Each combination of a trigger and an action is a rule. It&rsquo;s up to you to enforce (or not) a rule that you know about. When you enforce a rule, you must give the person information to indicate in what way their action violated the rule. The information you provide must be more specific than the violation. If you violate a rule, take back the card you played (if applicable), lose a point, and your turn ends (if it&rsquo;s your turn).&#10;&#10;For example, trigger #13 says, &ldquo;When you play a card that makes the total exactly zero&hellip;&rdquo; and action #5 says, &ldquo;&hellip;Name a Peanuts character that hasn&rsquo;t been named previously this game before you announce the sum of the trick.&rdquo; If I make the total 0 and don&rsquo;t say anything, you can make me take back my card and say, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say a name.&rdquo; The next time I make the total 0, If I say, &ldquo;Neil Armstrong,&rdquo; you can correct me again and say, &ldquo;Neil Armstrong isn&rsquo;t fictional.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The first player to end a round with 3 or more points more wins.&#10;&#10;This game owes a lot to the children&rsquo;s &ldquo;folk game&rdquo; Mao.&#10;&#10;"

The player who is first to hit the Boom card gives a token to the player who hit it last, but in all other penalty situations, players must race to find the lowest face-down token they hold and give it to the penalized player face up; whoever does so first gives the token away while all other players keep theirs and reshuffle them.

The game is set in the fantasy world of Triskearth, a brand new world utterly created by the designers of the game. Its history and geography, as well as the background for every race, are described in the first 150 pages of the rulebook. The remaining twenty pages describe the gaming rules, bringing to life a fast &amp; furios game of tactic and bashing!&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 11 x 16 squares field, each team can field on the pitch seven payers. Every team (are planned to be released nearly thirty teams) has its own rooster of players, each one with its stats (movement, strength, agility, constitution, ball play), skills and costs, including three different captains. The game time is divided in two halves each one made up of six turns for each player. Turns are played alternatively by each player, completing the action of a single player before passing to the next one. The aim of the game is to score more points (goals or kicks over the crossbar) than the opponent, and you can achieve this with a passing/dodging style or with a more brutal one. Someone could recognize a gameplay similar to other games concerning sports, but this is not a great flaw since Tutatis has it's peculiar flavor thanks to the rules of gaelic football (ie. not forward passage, soloing rule exc.) and to the characterization of each team.&#10;&#10;Greebo miniatures has produced a prerelease box of the game (with rules still in beta) at the 2011 Lucca Comics &amp; Games convention, and it was a sold out. That box contained a cardboard field, Italian rulebook, two Greebo's d6, a ball and two teams in 15mm (orcs and dwarves). Since then on Greebo's website have been published in English and in Italian the definitive set of rules and the roosters for the new teams, all available as free downloads. At the moment have been released three kinds of fields (irond peak, thornwell and standard), the miniatures of some mercenaries and nine teams: orcs, dwarves, evil puppets, necros, poffy and five different teams of thornwell (frogs, lizards, turtles, snakes and a mixed team). Greebo's team is working on the championship rules expected to be released as open beta in mid autumn 2012, as well as on a new edition of the game box. It's also on the desk the translation of the rules in french and spanish.&#10;&#10;"

Each game is provided as a learning excercise for the children playing.  The games focus on the language and number concepts such as colours, distance, time, quantity, sequencing etc.&#10;&#10;All 12 games follow the same sequence of play:&#10;The teacher setups the board for play.&#10;A background story is provided for the game.&#10;The teacher poses questions to the children based on the board setup.&#10;The children then take turns based on the directions of the teacher (i.e.  the teacher directs the children to move the parts around the board - the teacher then asks additional question to the children).&#10;&#10;"

The long-enjoyed peace of Yon has been disrupted by a ferocious and mean-spirited dragon &mdash; he's terrorizing the locals and eating their livestock without their permission! Fortunately, a few wannabe heroes (that's you!) have risen to the challenge of slaying the beast. Get yourself a brave companion, gather a powerful army, and enter the Dragon's Keep for cheese and country in Dragon Farkle!&#10;&#10;To play, you gather an army of loyal soldiers or steal them from your opponents, hire suspicious-looking companions and gain allegedly useful items (most of which aren't even cursed), then fight that dragon you've heard so much about &mdash; or don't, if you hate winning...&#10;&#10;"

The aim is to score 10,000 or more points (although with 6 or more players you can decide to play to 5,000 or 7,500 points).&#10;&#10;There are 110 cards - 14 each of 1-6, 22 Farkles and 4 score summary cards. Each player is dealt one card BUT all players can play off anyone else's cards. The rest of the deck is placed in the middle of the table and each player takes it in turn to draw one card from the deck and place it in front of themself or another player. The goal is to create combinations that score (eg three 1s = 300 points, three 6s = 600 points, six of any number = 3,000 points and so on). If you create a winning combination you can either slide it to the center of the table for potential scoring or leave it where it is to try and build a bigger score. You can stop drawing at any time and score any cards you've placed in the center. However, if at any time you draw a Farkle card you MUST stop drawing, and any cards in the center can't be scored and become part of the face-up cards in front of you. You keep your Farkle card to one side and no other players may take it but you may use it to score later. Farkle cards are scored whenever their owner makes a successful scoring combination. The first player to 10,000 points (or the agreed total) wins!&#10;&#10;The publisher places no limit on the number of players.&#10;&#10;"
