It was not long after his death that the Macedonian generals began to war among themselves over who would be the regent or successor to Alexander's empire. By 305 BC they had given up on succession and began to carve out their own kingdoms. Successors III is a four-player game based on those wars.&#10;&#10;Successors was first published in 1997 by Avalon Hill. Some years later a second edition rulebook was published that gave more options for the Tyche cards. Successors III builds on the foundation of the Successors II rules set plus expansion cards that appeared in the Boardgamer. Minor refinements have been made to make the game easier to play and increase enjoyment. The map is very similar to the original with some minor changes around Macedonia. Counters have the same excellent artwork for the generals and new GMT artwork for the combat units and control markers. The Tyche cards have received the most changes&mdash;nearly every card has had some minor modifications and a few new cards have been added.&#10;&#10;In addition to the changes, the rules have been cleaned up and improved. Years of questions and answers on Consimworld have been used to clarify the rules. The rules also include hints on strategy from a number of long-time Successors players, and an extended example of play.&#10;&#10;"

PQ-17 highlights the impact of reconnaissance, fuel, and the extreme climate without the drawbacks of a double-blind system or tedious bookkeeping.&#10;&#10;Each of the 1&quot; square ship counters in the game depicts an individual capital ship or cruiser or a group of smaller ships, submarines, or merchant vessels. Virtually every vessel that sailed arctic waters in 1942 is included, along with others that fought (or might have) in key actions. Counters are formatted much like the units in traditional block wargames, allowing step reduction to show damage or reduced numbers without cumbersome markers or rosters. These large counters never appear on the map, however; they remain off-map on players' Task Force Displays until battle is joined.&#10;&#10;Instead, players maneuver blocks on a mapboard stretching from Greenland and Ireland to Kiel and the Kara Sea. Each block is a force of submarines or surface ships, its identity hidden from the enemy player until it is located by a successful search and the block is turned up. It may represent one ship or one hundred - or none at all, as it may be a dummy. Reconnaissance is critical, as you must locate the enemy in order to attack him. Cards are used to resolve searches quickly and efficiently: a successful search yields intelligence of varying accuracy, while failure to relocate the enemy in a timely manner results in lost contact and generation of another dummy.&#10;&#10;Players must also cope with fuel restrictions, reflecting limited endurance (particularly for destroyers) and Axis shortages. Simple rules and the use of markers on the Task Force Displays preclude the need for record keeping while preventing unrealistic freedom of action.&#10;&#10;To show the key role of air power in the campaign, PQ-17 also includes over 100 air units. Circular counters represent RAF Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm squadrons and Luftwaffe Staffeln and Gruppen that participated in naval operations in the theater, as well as selected air defense units. Many VVS air regiments are also included, along with the USAAF squadrons that defended Iceland.&#10;&#10;Because the focus of the game is operational, battles are fought on an abstract Combat Display. Simple procedures and multiple Combat Results Tables reproduce historical levels of damage from all forms of combat: submarine attacks, antisubmarine warfare, bombing and aerial torpedo attacks, anti-aircraft fire, air-to-air combat, and naval surface actions.&#10;&#10;PQ-17's environmental model is based upon historical meteorological and oceanographic records to accurately reflect the extreme conditions and their effects. Summer operations, conducted in round-the-clock daylight, play much differently than those undertaken in the near-total darkness of winter. The polar ice pack advances and ebbs with the seasons, varying the sea routes available and posing a hazard for naval forces venturing too close. And besides each other, players must also battle some of the worst weather in the world, potentially damaging their ships and affecting movement, searches, and combat.&#10;&#10;PQ-17 features nine historical scenarios, including all the major actions of the campaign: the Fleet Air Arm torpedo attack on Tirpitz, the decimation of convoy PQ-17, the climactic battle of PQ-18, the Battle of the Barents Sea, and the 1943 Battle of North Cape. To add uncertainty, each side is subject to a special condition in every operation, which may impose additional requirements or restrictions - or afford additional opportunities - while remaining secret from the opponent. Just like their historical counterparts, Allied players can never be certain that the Germans will not attempt to break out into the Atlantic with one or more heavy ships, and Axis players must beware of a possible attack on Norway; both players may face conflicting priorities and demands that must be met with limited resources. In addition, a 1942 &quot;random&quot; scenario enhances replay value by further disguising starting forces and objectives. Each operational scenario can be played to conclusion in 3-4 hours, and for players seeking a richer experience, a 1942 campaign scenario reflects the challenges of continuing operations over the course of this key year.&#10;&#10;"

There are four symmetrically positioned large holes in the central area of the playing surface; the underlying platform prevents any more than one of these from being open at any particular time.  There are four similarly sized holes towards the perimeter of the rink.  In each quadrant around the perimeter of the board there is an area for scoring and a small hole to secure individual bumble slides.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to spin the platform.  When the platform is spun, players attempt to land their bumble in the hole.  Bumbles are introduced into the rink from player's slides.  If a bumble successfully finds a central hole that is open, that player scores a point for the round.  Any bumbles landing in the holes located near the perimeter of the rink lose a point for their player.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach ten points is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The question quickly arose; which topic, era, theater etc. should our second volume cover? We wanted something limited in scope, but that would offer a good number of ping-pong table sized battles. We also prefer to do subjects that have not been yet covered in miniatures. Island War came immediately to mind. The battles of the Pacific islands would certainly provide the proper size actions and only a game of Great Battles scope could cover the forces and time scales needed. Finally, we could include a Canadian action (Hong Kong) - always a bonus in our view. There was also German operations in Poland, France and the Mediterranean. Finally, of course there was the whole Eastern Front to choose from. We felt, however, that we should experiment more with the system before we wrote the definitive scenario book for WWII miniatures gamers - the Steppes of Russia.&#10;&#10;I think it was Marcel Van der Sleen who first floated the idea that Great Battles was the perfect vehicle to present airborne actions. He had done a fair bit of work on Operation Market Garden and insisted that Great Battle's scope and time scale could be worked into three or four linked scenarios leading to a grand-campaign that would reflect the whole operation. In addition, Marcel claimed that very few adjustments would be needed. The movement, combat and morale would be left unchanged. We had already worked with the basic organizations in Canadians in Europe. He was correct. Great Battles remained unchanged, throughout the project. The only differences were the additions of landing rules and the use of activation cards instead of a set number of activation points.&#10;&#10;Once into the research, I found that not only did the airborne operations offer interesting scenarios, but there was &quot;a little bit for everyone&quot;. There are air-drops of course but also tank-to-tank confrontations, elite units, militia units, street fighting, battalion operations, division operation and even corps operations. In addition, the Operations Mercury (Crete) and Operation Market Garden (Holland) could be linked into a grand campaign using defined battlefields (ping-pong tables) but allowing for area-to-area movement between tables - a rarity in miniatures gaming.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, we feel that Drop Zone offers a different type of miniatures scenarios. Those that have played Canadians in Europe will immediately notice the difference, in texture, between the set-piece co-ordinated attack-defend actions and the tenuous, nail-biting to-and-fro of an airborne operation. For those who have not played the other scenarios in this series, be prepared for a new gaming experience. Your games will not simulate a 40 minute fight for the local farmhouse or crossroads. Instead, you will have to plan a multi-day operation - to land parachute brigades or even divisions behind enemy lines and then relieve them. Great Battles puts you in the general's chair where deployment and activation of forces, weather, supply, recovery and reinforcements artillery and air support are more important than the penetrating power of a shell or the armor thickness of a turret.&#10;&#10;We are quite proud of Drop Zone and very pleased that Great Battles has made the transition to this new topic with such ease. We look forward to exploring other eras and theaters with Great Battles of World War II.&#10;&#10;"

Each of the chicks and hens fit on magnetic bases. Players throw the die and move their hen along the path. When the hen comes to a hiding chick, she moves as close as possible. The chick will either cling to the mother or be repelled, indicating which hen is the mother. The clinging chicks are taken back by the mother to home. First player to return 3 chicks wins.&#10;&#10;Note that this game cannot (fairly) be played with three players, as this would leave one player (who has the hen polarized differently to the other two) with a wider selection of chicks, and thus would need to move less to obtain them.&#10;&#10;"
