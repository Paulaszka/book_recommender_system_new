15510,,"Together, the players use cards to try to build the eight wonders of the ancient world. The number they build varies, but can't be more than seven. (Hence the subtitle of the game, &quot;...or why the eighth wonder was never built.&quot;) While building together, each tries to provide the majority of the components for each wonder and collect scoring disks (in four suits). When it's someone else's turn, you offer cards to the active player, and by good offers, can earn points (or sometimes even the disk).  So a feature of &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; is that players always perform actions and can earn points during another's turn. Card trade offers, collecting disk sets, and building wonders are the three ways to earn victory points. The game ends when a player takes the last disk of any one of the four suits, so players have some influence on the game's end moment.  And, the victory points determine the winner at game end. Typical game length is less than an hour.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Reiner Knizia Variant--some recommend against using the action cards because the publisher rather than Reiner Knizia added them and because they damage the game balance. To play with this variant, simply leave the action cards in the box. There is no bonus to the person who completes the final stage of a wonder.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

15512,,"Diamant &mdash; also published as Incan Gold &mdash; is a quick, fun, press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.&#10;&#10;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.&#10;&#10;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth extra points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each turn a layer must either start a new food chain by playing any card in front of themselves  or add to any one existing food chain by playing a card that the smallest creature can eat and/or a card that can eat the largest creature in that chain.  The player takes control of any food chain they add to.  The player then draws back up to 7 cards.  This continues until all of the cards have been played.
