One day, however, unfriendly and warlike tribes appeared from the lands beyond the horizon and brought danger to the four kingdoms. The four rulers decided together to protect the people from the evil invaders and bring them into the cities. However, because the cities were too small and unsafe, they were first to be enlarged and expanded. Defensive towers, churches and a city wall were to be built around the stately palace, which was also to be newly erected. And so the great builders of the world were commissioned to plan and implement the buildings for the kingdom of the mountain lands in the north, the kingdom of the sun in the east, the desert kingdom in the south and the kingdom of the forest peoples in the west. In order to get all this done in time before a possible attack by the enemy tribes, the builders gather people from all walks of life - from peasants to princes - to help and cooperate from the lands. Each person is given his or her task, which must be completed exactly according to plan and order.&#10;&#10;You and your fellow players slip into the role of these master builders. Everyone tries to place all their cards with the helping citizens on the building sites before all the other players. Act wisely and strategically as a master builder and you may become the greatest master builder of the four kingdoms...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;"

Eventually, the unpredictability of the seasons, the power of the floods, and the fragility of infrastructure contributed to the abandonment of cities--leaving only ruins to mark these impressive achievements.&#10;&#10;Today, modern technology and sheer hubris have resulted in a new set of settlements that again attempt to thrive in one of the world&rsquo;s harshest and driest climates. With the help of modern engineering marvels like the Hoover Dam and the Central Arizona Project canal, more than 7 million people call Arizona home and over 100,000 more residents move there each year. How long can this continue before, like other civilizations of old, nature asserts its dominance and returns the cities to dust?&#10;&#10;Watershed: Arizona is a turn-based asymmetrical game played in rounds. Each round consists of the following:&#10; 1.    Revealing climate conditions card which modifies the precipitation coming to the watersheds&#10;2.

To test it, there is a die associated with each piece of the Nuke, starting at a 4-sided die, then a 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and finally a 20-sided die.

Doing the border first, looking for a one of a kind piece and so on.&#10;&#10;In Jigsuw, players need to master not only the different tactics to build a puzzle but also when to change from one to another. They start by setting down the large circular core of the puzzle flat on the table. From there, the players divide the rest of the pieces among themselves, then it&rsquo;s off to the races. They compete to set down the pieces against the starting circle as fast as possible until the puzzle is complete.&#10;&#10;What makes Jigsuw interactive is that players don&rsquo;t just try to build the puzzle faster, but instead they need to try block their opponents. You block their pieces when you set down all surrounding ones before they get the chance to put theirs down. At this moment they cannot play it. The game continues until no one can lay down any pieces. Whoever ends the game with less pieces blocked wins the match.&#10;&#10;"
