Boer War is based on the conflict between the British Empire and the Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, which started in 1899 (generally known as the Second Boer War). The game covers the first year of the war; the conventional phase when the Boers could have gained a conventional victory. The latter part of the war was primarily a guerrilla conflict that did not officially end until 1902 and by which point a British victory was pretty much inevitable. In the game, each player is trying to seize an early victory: the British, in order to forestall the aforementioned guerrilla war, the Boers to gain sufficient support in Europe for their claims to full independence.&#10;&#10;The game has three scenarios. Two of them begin with the commencement of hostilities in October 1899 and the initial Boer successes. The third begins with Lord Roberts taking command of British forces and launching the counteroffensive which took the major Boer towns.&#10;&#10;Boer War Game Scale. One hexagon = approximately 90 kilometers. Each turn represents one month of operations. A corps represents two or three divisions plus corps echelon troops. A field force (division group) represents one or two reinforced divisions. A commando, brigade, or group represents 1-4000 fighting men.&#10;&#10;"

It is not about Washington, DC, but the efforts of the people on the spot, whether that is Claiborne Parish, Louisiana or Mobile, Alabama.&#10;&#10;Free at Last is a card-driven game in which each card has a number (used to activate special individuals) and an event, but uniquely, the color of the number also matters and affects the type of project (voting rights, accommodations, school desegregation) that can be attempted. Multiple-length versions can be played: 3 turns (ending with the Freedom Rides), 6 turns (ending with the March on Washington), or a 9 turn game covering this entire period in American history. Players take turns playing cards from their hand.  These cards let the players take actions to accomplish Projects--examples include working to desegregate schools in New Orleans; Fayette County voter registration; as well as the various Freedom Rides across the south.  They also can be used for a specific event on the card, granting special powers to the players--but also potentially creating future disadvantageous consequences or making cooperation between the players' groups more difficult.&#10;&#10;While the game will eventually mean one organization/player 'wins', players must work together; if projects fail and are suppressed by the segregationists, then the Civil Rights Movement falls apart.  Thus, Free at Last is cooperative AND competitive.&#10;&#10;Note: This game bears the same name and designer as Free at Last, but the designs each stand on their own, with this game being for 2-6 players while the previous game was for only two players.&#10;&#10;"

They are arranged in alternating rows for five pieces on each row with empty square between each other. White has pieces on 2ed and 5th row,  Black has pieces on 4th and 7th row.&#10;&#10;General rules of the game:&#10;The pawns move three free spaces vertically and horizontally, turning only one time (but you can't jump over any pawns)&#10;If any pawn (own or the opponent&rsquo;s one) is placed on the last square, you can take its place by moving it one free space in the direction of the last move.&#10;When the moving pawn, own or foreign, has no free square to move in the same direction, then it is removed from the board&#10;After the initiating movement, whether any of the pawns has been moved or taken off the board, the opponent has to move.&#10;&#10;The end of the game:&#10;The player who created the chain of life wins ... what means that all his pawns are connected in one continuous chain, not necessarily closed (connecting vertically or / and horizontally, or / and diagonally).&#10;Independently from creating the chain of life the player looses the game when all of his/her pawns are placed on one colour of the field.&#10;&#10;"
