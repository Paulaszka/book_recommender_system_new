Now all that's left is to perfect the formula, repeating the experiments to find the perfect combination of metals that produce the purest gold.&#10;&#10;Aurum is a trick-taking game for three or four players, with two teams of two competing in the four-player game. After all cards for the round have been dealt, you bid on how many tricks you think you/your team will win. (In a four-player game, the higher of the two bids on a team becomes the team's bid.)&#10;&#10;During the round, you can lead with any non-gold card. On your turn, you must not play a suit that has already been played (unless it is a gold card). The highest number played wins, but gold is the trump suit and always wins. Whoever played the lowest non-gold card adds a gold card of the same number from the supply to their collection if it is available. All gold cards played in a trick are returned to the supply.&#10;&#10;The round ends immediately when a player cannot play a valid base metal card and does not have a gold card to play or chooses not to play a gold card. If you win more tricks than you bid, you earn your bid value as points; if you met your bid exactly, you earn twice your bid value as points. Additionally, you earn points for the number of gold cards in your collection. The player/team with the most points wins a gold nugget, and the first to collect two nuggets wins!&#10;&#10;"

In the following years, players fund projects to further their mission objectives and provide additional funding for the next program year. Research topics reduce the cost of corresponding projects. In the base game, action cards can be played to help your program as well. After four years, government funding ceases, then the player with the most points wins, with points being awarded for progress in each of the eight mission objectives. A bonus is given to the first and second players to complete the entire objective.&#10;&#10;In the co-operative game, all players work together to complete the eight mission objectives before the end of the four program years.

One card is played per turn, and you may:&#10;&#10;1. Just extend a row/column and draw a new card. The card you play has to fit just one feature of a row or a column. Come up with one if there&rsquo;s none yet!&#10;What could bring a Picasso painting and a classic portrait together? Let's say, a white headdress! Now all the paintings you play in this row or column must contain a person with the white headpiece.&#10;&#10;OR&#10;&#10;2. Play your card at the intersection and don&rsquo;t draw a new card. The card you play has to fit both features of a row and a column. Think of one or even both of them!&#10;&#10;Your aim is to get rid of cards, but you don't draw a new one only if you manage to place a card that matches both row and column features, so you have to be very attentive, come up with challenging features, and think ahead to play all your cards on the table!&#10;&#10;&ndash; description from publisher&#10;&#10;The 112 cards from Artline Louvre, showing paintings from the museum&rsquo;s collection, are compatible with Dixit (but have a different back side design).&#10;&#10;"

The city of Barcelona is the most densely populated city in all of Europe. Shortly after the old city walls were finally destroyed, Ildefons Cerd&agrave;, who is now considered the inventor of urbanism, presented the plan for the creation of the &quot;Eixample&quot;, the expansion that Barcelona so desperately needed. Its construction began in 1860.&#10;&#10;In Barcelona, you will take on the role of builders in 19th-century Barcelona who are working on the new expansion to the city. Your main goal is to construct buildings to accommodate the citizens who want to leave the old city, and in the process, you will also build streets, create tram lines, and build public services. You may even decide to explore &quot;Modernisme&quot;, a new architectural and arts style that has been gaining popularity among the rich.&#10;&#10;Barcelona is played over a variable number of rounds interrupted by three scoring phases before a final scoring phase. Every round, each player takes a single turn consisting of two or more actions, a building phase, and then preparation for their next turn. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Keep your eyes peeled for the hidden signals&hellip; Will you spot the Suspicious Spuds!&#10;&#10;The host deals a coaster face down to everyone at the table with one Suspicious Spud shuffled in (2 for 10+ players). The host then chooses a number between 1 and 3. Each player finds the corresponding number on their coaster and does the actions listed and subtly say specific words anytime throughout the dinner. As the Suspicious Spuds will not have any actions or words on their coaster, they must pay attention and bluff their way through the dinner to remain undetected.&#10;&#10;At the end of the dinner, each player points to who they think is the Suspicious Spud(s). If the Spud(s) remain undetected, they win!&#10;&#10;"

First there was chaos caused by the Yellow Turbans, and then there was the dictatorship of Dong Zhuo, and the world has not had a single day of peace. The times make heroes, and many heroes and heroes emerged at this time, and they gathered in the Central Plains one after another, ushering in the war-torn era at the end of the Han Dynasty.&#10;&#10;In 190 A.D., the princes from all walks of life formed a coalition to attack Dong Zhuo, and Dong Zhuo was forced to retreat and move westward to Chang'an. In 191 A.D., the coalition forces were disbanded due to discord, and the princes had ulterior motives in their hearts, and they did not hesitate to fight each other in order to compete for territory. The following year, Dong Zhuo was killed and L&uuml; Bu fled. Beginning in 191 A.D., the seven forces in the Central Plains have gradually developed into powerful heroes through conquests and mergers. Lu Bu, the flying general who is unparalleled in the country, Yuan Shu who proclaimed himself emperor in Huainan, Liu Bei who took over Xuzhou, and Liu Biao who sat on the sidelines.

One player plays the role of the People's Liberation Army(PLA), and the other plays the role of the NRA.&#10;&#10;This is a special battle, and when the NRA landed, there was a huge disparity in strength between the two sides. NRA had an absolute advantage of about 10-1, not only in terms of sea and air superiority, but also in the presence of the first deployed special force&mdash;the paratrooper battalion. Hu Lian(&#232;&#131;&#161;&#231;&#144;&#143;) thought he had a safe chance of winning and could quickly occupy the entire island, and then use the dangerous terrain to implement defense, in order to demonstrate the strength of NRA to the United States and lay the groundwork for future counterattacks on the mainland. As a result, PLA on the island stubbornly resisted and held onto the crucial Eight Foot Gate(&#229;&#133;&#171;&#229;&#176;&#186;&#233;&#151;&#168;) Ferry. The reinforcements rushed from the mainland and entered the battlefield half a day later. At this point, the crucial role of the commander was demonstrated, and Hu Lian decided to immediately retreat. While feinting on the front line, the rear troops retreated in an orderly manner. In just one day, the already deployed troops were gathered and boarded, completing a more difficult retreat than an attack. The successful recapture of Dongshan Island by PLA has shed its former shame.&#10;&#10;The mechanism of this game was modified based on Kinmen 1949: The Battle that Saved Taiwan.&#10;&#10;Scale = 800 meters /hex;&#10;&#10;     time = 8 hours /GT;&#10;     size = battalion or company / unit.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
