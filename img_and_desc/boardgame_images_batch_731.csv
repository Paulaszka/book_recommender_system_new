In between the streets are numbered houses, retail outlets and industrial locations.&#10;&#10;Each player starts on a different corner of the board and rolls the die to move along the white track on the outside of the board. Each time he passes his starting station, he completes one patrol. The last player to complete his third patrol gets stuck with the Rookie badge.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player lands on a &quot;fire&quot; space, he draws the top card from the Fire deck, which illustrates the cause of the fire and gives a location. The player then has four rolls of the die to move the fire engine from the station to that location to put out the fire. If he succeeds, he draws a Results card and follows directions; if not, he moves his piece back one space.&#10;&#10;The game is said to have been designed by a firehouse in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the box shows it was distributed as an educational tool through other fire departments. (One copy has a label saying &quot;Compliments of Roy L. Parrish, Fire Chief, Clark County Fire Dept., Nevada&quot;.)&#10;&#10;"

Ten cards are placed beside the first four rows in stacks of 4, 3, 2 and 1 card. On their turn, the player picks up an open card from one of the stacks next to the game board and places it in another row &mdash; always in a clockwise direction. All players whose colors are on that card (one or two) are then allowed to build a new tower or build on top of an existing tower in this particular row. Building on an open space is free, while building on top of somebody else's tower costs as many ducats as the number of &quot;floors&quot; already built. A player can decide to trigger a general round of scoring simply by moving the last card of any stack. High towers are a good way to claim a large, connected territory and collect a lot of ducats.&#10;&#10;"

In this two-player variant of Bohnanza, both bean farmers give each other gifts of beans they can't use themselves &mdash; to make life harder for their opponent, if possible. Trying to fulfill their secret &quot;bo(h)nus&quot; requirements, they both need to keep a vigilant eye on the other player's bean fields.&#10;&#10;In more detail, both duelists have bean field mats in front of themselves on which to plant their beans. Between them is a row of eight gift cards. Each player holds five hand cards and three &quot;bo(h)nus cards&quot; with secret objectives. In this game, you have the option of planting more than one type of bean in the same field, but when you plant a different bean than the one you've planted previously, this new bean type must be the next highest number. When harvesting your beans, the beanometer of the card you've most recently planted is what counts.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, the active player plants two beans from their hand, then reveals bean cards from the deck as usual. Instead of trading, however, they offer their opponent one bean as a gift by pushing this bean type's gift card in their direction. The other player can accept the gift or decline it, but if they don't take it, they have to offer a gift in return. You are allowed to bluff, but it may cost you if your bluff is called! Important: Only the first player to accept a gift actually receives the bean card in question. After this exchange, plant all beans you have received and turned over, then draw new cards. &quot;Bo(h)nus&quot; cards can be fulfilled at any time when the required combination of beans printed on the card can be found in any bean field. Fulfilling an objective earns you bean dollars and the brand new bean cents. When the draw pile is used up, the player with the most bean dollars wins.&#10;&#10;In 2020, AMIGO released Bohnanza: The Duel &ndash; Deluxe, which replaces the gift cards with a game board and gift tokens. This edition also contains newly designed bean fields and bonus cards.&#10;&#10;"

The riskier, more difficult pot or the safer, easier one?&#10;&#10;The difficulty of each shot is calculated depending on the number of cards between the cue ball and the target pocket, whether there are any other balls in the way and the angle at which you hit the object ball. You have a Cue (upgradable) with a Power tracker as well as Chalk (needed for trickier shots). You can opt to apply extra power to reduce the shot difficulty, but both Cue Power and Chalk are limited resources that you'll need to manage. Then you roll two dice and if at least one of them scores equal or higher than the difficulty, the pot succeeds.&#10;&#10;Miss a shot and there's a chance your opponent will clear the table and win.&#10;&#10;"

Each Round represents about 6 weeks of a football season.&#10;&#10;During setup, each Player chooses a Club and is dealt a random squad of Footballers and a Manager.

Each Match Day influences the league position of all clubs, so you're never left waiting for your turn.&#10;&#10;You can boost your score through the use of Tactics cards played both before and after each Match Day Roll. Careful management of Tactics cards might be the difference between stealing the title for some, or avoiding relegation for others. These cards allow your players (such as the Wing Wizard, Ancient Attacker, and Incredible Sulk) to pull off elegant interceptions, lucky deflections, and wonder goals.&#10;&#10;The two twelve-sided bring about the fortunes and misfortunes that can affect any club or Footballer.

Sun points are earned in a number of ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     having workers in your village,&#10;     having resources in your village,&#10;     constructing buildings and monuments,&#10;     fulfilling unique requirements (having three of a certain card, for example), and&#10;     having a larger army than your neighbours, forcing them to pay Sun point tributes.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will also learn some basic words in Quechua and Aymara, two Incan languages which are still spoken today.&#10;&#10;"

The dealer shuffles the deck then deals five cards face down to each player. The dealer places the remaining deck face down near the center of the play area to form a draw pile. The discard pile: During the game, a discard pile will form next to the draw pile as players place cards onto it. Player cannot draw cards from the discard pile. The non-dealer player takes the first turn. Player then alternate turns. Keep paper and a pencil handy to keep track of your scores from quarter to quarter&#10;&#10;On your turn: Make one offensive play (if you can). Place an offensive card (or combination of cards) from your hand face up in the center of the play area. If your opponent plays a defensive card, you do not score. Then take the top card from the draw pile to replace it. This ends your turn. If your opponent does not play a defensive card, he/she says &quot;Take it&quot; You score the points shown on your card(s). Place the card(s) aside, face up into your scoring pile. Then take the top card from the draw pile to replace it. This ends your turn.  If no card in your hand are playable, discard two cards of your choice. Then take the top card from the draw pile to replace it. This ends your turn.&#10;&#10;Offensive plays: On your turn, play one of the following cards, or combination, to try to score points. 2-pointer, 3-pointer and dunk are the cards that can be played.  You may play anyone of these cards to try and score the number of points shown on the card. On the same turn an AND 1 card is played along side any of the three cards to add one point to your score.&#10;&#10;Defensive Plays: On your opponent's turn, after your opponent has made an offensive play, you may play a defensive card to block his/her shot. NOTE: the DUNK card is protected against some defensive plays but the JUKEM card is unstoppable.  After blocking your opponent's play, discard both your card and your opponent's card. Your opponent take the top card from the draw pile to replenish his/her hand, then you do the same. This ends your opponent's turn. Defensive cards: BLOCK!, MISS!, 3- Second violation, Brick!, Air Ball! and Technical Foul.&#10;&#10;Ending the Quarter: When the draw pile runs out, keep taking turns to play as many of your cards as you can. The quarter ends when neither player can make a play or when a player makes a HALF COURT shot. Tally up your score for the quarter and record it on paper. Your opponent does the same. Shuffle all of the cards thoroughly, then play the next quarter the same way you played the previous quarter. The player who did not deal in the previous quarter deals in the new quarter.&#10;&#10;How to win: &#10;When the fourth quarter ends, the game is over and player tally their total points. The player with the highest score wins. &#10;Overtime: In case of a tie, play another quarter to determine the winner. &#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each player takes one large blue cup, six small red cups, and one black chip. Shuffle the challenge cards and place them face down on the table. A challenge card will have an activity for the player to complete. For example, the classic challenge card has a player take 6 red cups and put them on the edge of the table and who ever flips all 6 over first wins. A challenge card is randomly drawn from the stack and players take turns reading the cards. It is highly encourage to discuss the goal of the card so that players understand how the challenge works. If indicated on the card, players set up cups on the table before they begin. When they are ready the opposing players simultaneously say &quot;Let's get this flippin' party started!&quot; and begin. The first player to finish the challenge and yells &quot;Done!&quot; is the winner.&#10;&#10;For smaller groups, the player with the most wins after facing other player is the Flip Cup Champion. If there is a tie, then the two (or more) players compete against each other in a Flip Cup Championship round.&#10;&#10;For tournament-style play, draw three cards randomly and compete in a best of three for each round. Winners advance to the next round until only tow players are left standing, competing for the Flip Cup Championship. The Championship is one card only: draw a card at random and take your best shot at the title!.&#10;&#10;"

Each player receives 11 pieces: five soldiers, five tanks, and one missile launcher. The map graphics include a road, a railway, towns, bridges, a river, streams, swamps, lakes, woods and many contour lines, but these play no role in the game. The only relevant markings are the diagonal lines across the middle two rows, which is a neutral zone or &quot;no-man's land&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players may set up their pieces freely on their side of the neutral zone. They move alternately, one piece at a time, and each piece may move only a single space orthogonally.&#10;&#10;A piece captures an enemy piece by moving next to it, but the required direction changes depending on the nature mix of pieces. Like pieces (infantry vs. infantry, tank vs. tank) can capture from any of the four directions. Infantry can only kill a tank from its side or rear. A tank can only kill infantry if the target is directly in front of it. The missile launcher may kill any one piece at any distance, but then turns into another tank.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to get a piece onto his opponent's back row. The game says it is for children aged 7 to 10.&#10;&#10;"
