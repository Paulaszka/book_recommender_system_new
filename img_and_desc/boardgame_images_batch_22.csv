2557,,"Each player starts out with one castle on the game board. Your objective is to capture all your opponents' castles, so that you are the last player remaining in the game.&#10;&#10;This game in the Risk family of games is markedly different than the original Risk. The combat mechanism is the same but players receive armies at the end of the turn, not the beginning (the sole exception being playing a Reinforcements card). The game has no territory cards, and one does not get armies based on the total number of individual territories. One gets armies for regions controlled and banners in one's castle only. Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.&#10;&#10;The cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy). The Spy card can also be used to defend against another Spy.&#10;&#10;"

2559,,"Described on-box as the &quot;Beat the Barrier&quot; strategy game. Players each have 2 pawns, 9 green walls (which are placed vertically), and 9 blue walls (placed horizontally). Pawns start on the color matching them, which are 4x4 squares in on each of the four corners of the 11x14 board. The object is simple: to get one of your pawns to a starting spot of your opponent. Each turn players can move one pawn up to two spaces, and also place one wall, useful for blocking off their opponent's move. Walls always cover two squares worth of area, and must be placed according to their color (vertically or horizontally). Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.&#10;&#10;This game is one of a series of 2 player strategy games by Lakeside from the 1970s.&#10;&#10;"

Certain combinations of monster sets may only be captured using specific monster-catching devices.

2573,,"This matching game is a close relative of Dominoes. Each tile has two sides, and each side contains at most one road, one river, and one rail. You can only play a new tile adjacent to a played tile if the sides match. The act of playing tiles creates a map of an intricate twisting transportation network. The tile illustrations are very pleasing to both young and old alike. Only two of the tiles are branching, so the game is mostly played at both ends of the tiles already laid down.&#10;&#10;Several variants are supplied in the rules. You can play this game competitively like Dominoes, or cooperatively like a free-form jigsaw puzzle.&#10;&#10;First published in 1969 by James Galt and Company, Limited, Cheadle/Cheshire.&#10;Then in 1970 as 'Connect' (in Dutch, French and German as 'Contact') by Ravensburger.&#10;Re-released 1984 by Ravensburger as 'Rivers, Roads and Rails' (in Europe still as 'Contact').&#10;&#10;"

Each player pursues the goal of developing as many Achievements of the best quality as possible, by placing his own counters onto the game board.

2580,,"Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East:&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf uses the same rules as the other games in the Third World War series to show a different aspect of modern warfare operations in the deserts and mountains of the middle east.&#10;&#10;Persian Gulf includes a special &quot;game within a game&quot;, covering the diplomatic, political, and military maneuvers by the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East before - and leading to - the general outbreak of the Third World War. Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.&#10;&#10;The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. &#10;Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.&#10;&#10;The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown. Victory conditions take account of the oil resources of the Gulf. Additional rules allow Persian Gulf to be combined and played with the other three games in the Third World War series.&#10;&#10;"

Paletti too had little money, but instead he had a marvelous plan. Why buy new columns when he could re-use the old ones that his Grandfather had built?

You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.&#10;&#10;You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.&#10;&#10;Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.

2603,,"A tradeable card game covering the events of the Lord of the Rings movies. Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.&#10;&#10;The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each &quot;lost&quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this &quot;health&quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no &quot;tapping&quot;. Also importantly, this is not a &quot;draw one&quot; game but a &quot;hand-filling&quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;shadow&quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.&#10;&#10;Unlike some of their other published games, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions).&#10;&#10;This game &quot;ended&quot; when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.

2605,,"Popular and intriguing military air, sea and ground forces tactics game TRI-TACTICS by Harry Gibson&#10;&#10;History:&#10;&#10;This board game was launched in 1935 by Gibsons aiming to provide an amalgamation of three other tactical board games:&#10;&#10;- L'Attaque (1909) - the U.K. rights were acquired by Gibsons in 1925.&#10;- Dover Patrol (1911)&#10;- Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence (1925)&#10;&#10;All of these Gibsons games, marketed at the time as Series: The Big Four (Gibsons), predate Stratego (1942) by Jumbo which shares many similar aspects of play, but is now much more well known.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a special 12x12 board which illustrates land and sea spaces equally for each side, and each with two special squares, an HQ and a Lake containing a Naval Base. Two players, one RED, the other BLACK, command combined Navy, Airforce and Army forces, with a total of 112 prices, each player starting with 56, comprising the following:&#10;&#10;Infantry&#10;5 Battalions - rank 1&#10;4 Brigades - rank 2&#10;3 Divisions - rank 3&#10;2 Army Corps - rank 4&#10;1 Army - rank 5&#10;&#10;Artillery&#10;5 Anti-Aircraft gun - rank AA&#10;4 Field Artillery - rank FA&#10;3 Heavy Artillery - rank HA&#10;&#10;Naval Force&#10;4 Destoryers  - rank 1&#10;3 Cruisers - rank 2&#10;2 Battleships - rank 3&#10;1 Aircraft Carrier - rank 4&#10;1 Submarine - rank SM&#10;4 Flying Boats - rank FB&#10;&#10;Air Force&#10;4 Reconnaissance Planes - rank 1&#10;3 Bombers - rank 2&#10;2 Two-Seat Fighters - rank 3&#10;&#10;Auxiliary&#10;8 Searchlights - rank SL&#10;&#10;At the beginning of game, these 56 pieces are placed by a player to occupy the first 5 rows of one side (but not on the HQ or Lake), with the other player doing likewise with their 56 on the opposite side&rsquo;s 5 rows. This leaves two whole rows in the centre of the board empty, as well as the HQ, Lake, and 2 other squares between the two forces facing each other. All types and ranks of the pieces are hidden at the beginning of the game&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to occupy the opponent&rsquo;s HQ with an Infantry piece, or the Lake with a Naval piece (not including the FB), which must approach via the river.&#10;&#10;The players draw lots to decide who commences play, by moving one piece, and thereafter play alternates between the players, by moving one piece per turn.&#10;&#10;All pieces can move one square at a time, forwards, backwards or sideways, with the exception of the Searchlight which can move multiple squares in a single direction (but only when attacking), as long as the squares are unoccupied.&#10;&#10;To attack, a player must move a piece adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s piece and announce &lsquo;Attack&rsquo;. They may choose not to, in which case they state &lsquo;No Attack&rsquo;. In that case, the opponent cannot on their turn attack that adjacent piece without first moving another of his pieces.&#10;&#10;The two adjacent pieces of each player are then revealed. The attacks are resolved by consulting the Value Table; as a general rule, the highest rank wins, but there are various combinations that apply, particularly when comparing land, sea and air pieces on land, sea or over a coastline. If successful, the attacker remains where they are, and the defender&rsquo;s square becomes empty as the defender&rsquo;s piece is removed. If the attacker loses, their piece is removed, and the defender&rsquo;s piece remains where it is. If the pieces are the same rank, both are removed.&#10;&#10;It is allowed to place Land pieces on the sea and Naval pieces on the land, but with the risk that when attacked, any such piece found to be operating &lsquo;out of their element&rsquo; will immediately forfeit and removed. Excluded from this rule is the FB as well as all Air Force pieces and the Searchlights.&#10;&#10;The River is a special area which is classified as Land or Sea depending on which piece is occupying it. When a Naval piece does so, the square is designated Sea, and when a Land price occupies it, then it is classified as Land. On the rest of the board, where land and sea meet, then the spaces are classified as Sea or Land depending on which is in the majority. The coastline in each case separates these defined areas of Land and Sea. Should there be an attack between a Ship and a Land piece over a coastline, the attacker is forfeit, except for HA and AA when the ordinary ruling applies. Also, Bombers and FB destroy Infantry and FA.&#10;&#10;The HQ and Lake must not be occupied but a piece may be move over these squares in consecutive turns or else be forfeit. Only Ships (not FB) may attack and capture the Lake, and to do so must move up the River (it cannot capture the Lake by entering via Land, or then it must exit via the river to sea); in doing so, in this special case it captures all Land pieces in attacks, except HA. Similarly, only Infantary pieces (not Artillery) may attack and capture the HQ.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Dover Patrol&#10;    Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence&#10;    Stratego&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The players may bet on any horse to win. After the betting is over the race begins. The players roll one die and move their horses in turn, utilizing the cards earned during the first half of the game whenever it is felt to be advantageous. The players who bet on the winning horse divide the money bet on the race minus ten percent (that goes to the Bookmaker).&#10;&#10;"

2609,,"The game is quite simple and definitely family fare. Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.&#10;&#10;The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.&#10;&#10;"

One of the greenhorns accompanying the current expedition?&#10;&#10;To find out which of these greenhorns might be best for the job, McTrucker gives each of them a mission on the final day of the expedition &ndash; and to make sure he finds out how they fare against one another, the missions all bring them into competition with one another. Only the one who can enforce his will best over the others and best deal with unexpected situations will merit being appointed expedition leader.&#10;&#10;To set up Westw&auml;rts, twenty wagon cards &ndash; along with settlers, gold mines and even a scout, barber, preacher, teacher, cook and gravedigger &ndash; are placed beside a munitions wagon. Five cards each are randomly distributed on four area cards (pastureland, desert, Indian country and mountain country). Thirty job cards can be completed, four of which are laid out face-up with a reward of 1-3 gold nuggets for each when completed.&#10;&#10;The progress of the wagon train is controlled by cards, with each player holding three in hand. While game flow is simple, fulfilling demands is not always so. Each player places a movement card face down. The current player reveals his own and that of another. With these two cards, he then resolves the wagon train movements and tries to fulfill jobs. The game ends when a player has earned 15 nuggets or fewer than four incomplete jobs remain. Some jobs are simple with small payoffs while a more difficult one would require, for example, equipping one area with three settlers and two gold diggers or placing the preacher between a settler and a gold digger. In such cases, often the second card is of no help unless players make special arrangements with one another: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Special cards do things like eliminate or paralyze certain wagons due to fire or broken axles.&#10;&#10;"

2620,,"In English the title means Swimmers in the Desert which for some will give away the &quot;setting&quot; as that of the novel and film, THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.&#10;&#10;When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.&#10;&#10;"

Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.

Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.&#10;&#10;You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &quot;Dip&quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &quot;cancel dip&quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.

In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#152;&#155; Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

2654,,"The Snap deck consists of 60 cards in 4 color suits. The cards are numbered front and back from 1 to 15. The game is played in two phases. In the &quot;cool phase,&quot; players draw and discard cards in turn order, with the stipulation that the discarded card must be higher in value than the one drawn. This continues until one player is satisfied with the mix achieved in his/her 7-card hand and calls &quot;Snap.&quot; At that point, the &quot;hot phase&quot; begins, with players slapping cards at will - although one at a time - on the discard pile. When two cards with with matching color are placed one over the other, that suit becomes the winning suit. Players then score points for cards of that color in their hand. Players also score for all other cards of any color with numbers matching their winning-suit cards remaining in other players' hands (except for cards valued 10 and above). It is suggested to play as many rounds as players in the game, with the player achieving the most points overall winning.&#10;&#10;"

The prize that our team receives for a successfully completed job is dependent on the number of tasks. However, the number of machines is limited and the competition among the teams is rough. No methods are shunned in the constant effort to keep away opposing workers or hinder their performance, not even bribery or sabotage. The only thing that matters at the end of the game is which team has the most money.&quot;&#10;-From English rulebook&#10;&#10;"
