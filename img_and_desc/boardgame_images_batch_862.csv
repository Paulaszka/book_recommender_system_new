Faced with overwhelming odds, the British gave ground slowly as they fell back toward the English Channel, finally exiting the Continent through the miraculous evacuation at Dunkirk.&#10;&#10;Road to Dunkirk is a complete Panzer Grenadier game based on the epic battles waged by the British Expeditionary Force against the Germans in the spring and early summer of 1940. There are 47 scenarios based on these battles, organized into six &ldquo;battle games&rdquo; that allow you to play the scenarios in sequence toward your army&rsquo;s operational goals. Scenario design is by Philippe L&eacute;onard, who designed our Panzer Grenadier: 1940 The Fall of France game.&#10;&#10; Road to Dunkirk includes 517 die-cut and silky-smooth playing pieces. There are eight heavy cardstock maps with artwork by Guy Riessen so they match up nicely with those from 1940: The Fall of France.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The game combines vocabulary with competition to create a perfect source of entertainment for any occasion. Turning the car game into a card game made it possible to add more features that add to the excitement. With new cards such as the &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; card and the &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; card, the game has twists and turns you won&rsquo;t see coming!  We are passionate about words and are super excited to introduce Word Ghost!&#10;&#10;Objective / Rules&#10;The game can be played by any number of people at any age. The objective of the game is to use your letters to continually create a word without ever finishing that word. Each player will begin with &ldquo;letter cards&rdquo; in their hand and one by one will place a letter down in order to spell a word they have in their head. The word must be four letters long to be considered a knockout word. This means 1-3 letter words are fine to play.  If a player is caught completing a word, he or she is out. The game gets interesting when introducing the &ldquo;special cards.&rdquo; These cards are incorporated into the card game because it changes the dynamic of the game and the word(s) being played.&#10;&#10;Special Cards&#10;The &ldquo;special cards&rdquo; consist of wild cards, skip cards, reverse cards, &ldquo;remove 1&rdquo; cards, &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; cards, and anagram cards. The wild card allows the player to play any letter of your choosing, the skip card allows a player to skip their own turn, and the reverse card allows the player to reverse the order of the game. The &ldquo;remove 1&rdquo; card allows the player to remove one letter from the word and the &ldquo;remove 2&rdquo; card allows the player to remove two letters from the word. When using the removal cards, the player must pull all the letters together without reordering. The anagram card allows the player to rearrange all the letters to create a part of a new word. The letters still cannot form a word, or that player is out. Another competitive aspect of the game is the &ldquo;challenge.&rdquo; The challenge is used when a player thinks their opponent that plays directly before them is spelling a fake word. In this situation, the player can say: &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; to their opponent and that player must say the word he or she was spelling. If the word is valid, the player that called the challenge is out and if the word is not valid, the challenged player is out.&#10;&#10;Rule Variations &#10;There are technical infinite rule variations to the game which you can come up with.  Here are two that we like:  &#10;&#10;     The &ldquo;strike play&rdquo; method allows the players to use a strike system instead of an instant elimination.  Think of it like playing &ldquo;HORSE&rdquo; on a basketball court. When a player spells a word, he or she will get a strike and when that player collects three strikes, then he or she is out. &#10;     The &ldquo;timed play&rdquo; method calls for a timer that will only give the players a certain amount of time to play their letter or they automatically lose.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game will challenge your vocabulary and your ability to stay one step ahead of your opponents. It is the perfect game for a quiet night in or to be the center of game night.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Intimidate or provoke your enemies to scare them or force them to attack carelessly. Use your diplomatic abilities to calm dangerous, psychopathic entities until you are able to backstab them or plead on the behalf of honorable opponents. Manage the stress of battle, seek to understand your opponents&rsquo; perverse intelligence and use that knowledge to destroy them or to find a way to save them from destroying themselves and everyone you hold dear.&#10;&#10;Welcome to Yamashiro.&#10;&#10;Campaign&#10;&#10;The city of Yamashiro is an immense micro-universe where the lives of the citizens, heroes and enemies are tightly intertwined.

Craft equipment, revel in festivals, expand the city, take advantage of the amenities of its many facilities, and explore personal relationships with the town&rsquo;s inhabitants as well as its assailants. Sankokushin does not require a heavy, multi-player commitment to reach the end of a campaign and it will not abruptly end if things go poorly. However, only those who travel across time and memory will gain the knowledge necessary to free Yamashiro from the burden of its tragic fate.&#10;&#10;Procedural Narrative&#10;&#10;No walls of text. No &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; choices. Sankokushin instead wraps you in its unique story as you experience Yamashiro without confining you to a guided plotline. Instead of presenting you with only narrative choices, the storyline is organically generated by the heroes&rsquo; actions during both the combat encounters and the city phase. The assailants of Yamashiro and its inhabitants are all intimately connected by a dark fate and only the actions of the heroes can alter the course of their destiny. These interrelationships have profound consequences in game and they are the heart of Sankokushin&rsquo;s narrative and it is impossible to experience them all in a single playthrough as they are a reflection of your unique playstyle so different gaming groups will have different experiences.&#10;&#10;Intelligent Enemies&#10;&#10;Each of the 10 bosses included in Sankokushin has a unique personality and story arc that is closely linked with the overall narrative. The way you deal with each of them will reverberate throughout the course of the campaign. You will learn to love and hate their twisted personalities and will see that the methods used to fight them will deeply influence their future behavior. They learn from your strategies and change their attitude towards you (and the way they fight!) according to the way you psychologically approach them thanks to the unique communication system. Sankokushin is designed by a small team whose knowledge in the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis have made possible bosses with realistic, uncanny, and perverse personalities that will show you the darkest sides of human nature.&#10;&#10;"

These attempts took place during the months on January and February 1900, most famously at Spion Kop.&#10;&#10;The core game will be the same as Redvers Reverse utilizing the same scale for the map and counters. To reiterate the games mechanics -  it is at Battalion and Battery level with emphasis upon the leadership of the British at a Brigade level for Infantry and at Divisional level for the Cavalry.  The key feature of the game is to present the player with the problems and difficulties that Buller himself faced.&#10;&#10;However there are key differences. Most notably is the fact that a game system that previously covered nothing more than a few hours will now cover a number of weeks. This is achieved by giving the player the opportunity to make a maximum of three breakthrough attempts in order to reach Ladysmith. This fits with the historical attempts on the Tabanyana Heights, Spion Kop and Val Krantz.  Each breakthrough attempt, and its outcome, will have an impact on subsequent attempts.  The player will have a series of predetermined target areas, at three different levels for each attempt. The level of success will determine the starting level  of the Boer Confidence track for the next attempt. The more casualties inflicted the more diluted will be the Boer variable strength marker pool. However push too far and you own strength levels will be compromised with the increased likelihood of losing good quality leaders for the next breakthrough attempt. For each attempt you can push on into a second day but this is not without risk and will require you to reach a higher level of target area. Failure to reach any of the harder targets may well improve, rather than decrease Boer confidence levels.&#10;&#10;It would not be a British Empire campaign without command confusion and there is plenty of that here. Events cover the situation where, historically, there were three people who believed they were in command during the attempt to secure Spion Kop. In addition whilst Warren is in charge for the first, and probably the second attempt, he must achieve a level of success otherwise he is demoted and either Buller or Clery take charge. If Warren or Clery are in command then Events exist where Buller meddles and further confusion occurs.&#10;There are four possible breakthrough scenarios, the three historical ones and Brakfortein Ridge. You determine which you undertake by rolling on a table; which attempts you have already undertaken and the level of success achieved, will influence where the next attempt is. It is possible that you could undertake an attempt against the same location twice (but not all three times).&#10;&#10;One change in the  game map is that certain areas are designated &lsquo;Peak areas&rsquo; and one area (Spion Kop) is split into three &lsquo;Peak areas&rsquo;.  Peak areas improve Fire distances for artillery, are more vulnerable for defending Infantry (if not in an emplacement) and will be occupied by Boer units if vacant and adjacent to them.&#10;&#10;In addition they provide the reasoning behind employing a number of additional Event counters.&#10;Tugela has Event counts, amongst others, for Murderous fire (basically free shots at units adjacent to both Infantry and Artillery in a Peak area),  British Surrender, Boer Loss of Nerve, Boer Inspired Leadership and  Acton homes (will explain as testing progresses).&#10;&#10;Given some of the steep slopes certain movements will require the unit to stay put for a turn before moving again. There will be no searching for Drifts in Tugela, unlike Redvers Reverse, as the four main drifts are well known. There will be three Pontoon bridges which can be laid under certain conditions. &#10;There are a number of addition battles from the Boer War which lend themselves to the system, particularly those concerning the relief of Kimberley. In addition the Natal campaign has more to offer notably the eventual success at Tugela Heights and the siege of Ladysmith itself.&#10;&#10;However the third volume of the system will be moving to the Crimean War and the battle of Inkermann. This time, as the British, the player is in a largely defensive roll.&#10;  &#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Despite political instability, each faction wants to enlarge its possessions and is not afraid to face also armed clashes, with bloody battles later forgotten in the windings of the official historiography... Meanwhile, the Arena and the gladiators are important faces in the fight for the power: the people worship their idols!&#10;&#10;Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome is a strategy and combat board game, set in a period where the power of emperors is often challenged by ambitious province governors or by smart military commanders. In Rome, the Senate is torn apart by the struggle among the various factions, while the people can be influenced by the charisma of the heroes fighting in the Arena. You will have to balance the development of each settlement, the conquest of new territories (even through military battles) and the growth of the skills of your Hero, so to control the most of the Eternal City&rsquo;s seven hills: only in this way it will be possible to dominate Rome and, perhaps in the future, even the entire Empire...&#10;&#10;In Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome, each player will command a powerful Roman dynasty and will have to struggle to gain the domination over the Capital of the Empire: build barracks and farms and expand your influence on the &ldquo;domus&rdquo; on the seven hills of Rome, but do not forget to use your resources to erect a temple in honor of one of the deities! In return, you will have incredible relics for your hero, as well as unique powers for gaining an advantage and defeat your rivals. But do not underestimate the Arena, if you manage to accumulate more glory, the whole city could be yours, but if you were defeated... well, in Rome the losers have a short life!&#10;&#10;Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome offers exceptional components, many miniatures and the 3D models of the seven hills of Rome, true focus of the game and whose conquest will determine the winner. Next to them there is also the Gladiator Arena, in which the players&rsquo; fighters will compete to the death to increase glory and influence of their faction. The union among resources management, cards and combat make this game unique, but also the historical accuracy is important: indeed, we tried to rely on really existed events, characters and places, to allow players to immerse themselves in a sometimes neglected, but also fascinating and glorious, historical period.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

A British loss in the Great Lakes could have easily meant Canada would be part of the United States today.&#10;&#10;During each turn each player receives action points plus random action points to activate his units for movement and combat. During combat each unit rolls dice and scores hits on opponent units.  Careful planning is required not to get trapped.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by occupation of key terrain features and elimination of enemy units.&#10;&#10;Due to the randomness of the action points no two games play the same.  For this reason the game plays great solitaire (no solo engine - but by playing both sides).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;

272535,,"In Judgement, players assume the role of one of the five 'Everlasting', demigods who live on the Shadow Plane known as Between. Each of the five were once champions of their race before transcending from mortals to demigods while on a quest to destroy the gods of old.&#10;&#10;Their quest was bestowed upon them at The Gathering, a time when the major races of Athien came together to select five among them, so they could travel to the plane of shadow and stop the meddling of the old gods. The orcs and dwarfs nominated their most respected spiritual leaders, Krognar and Bruell to guide the five. The Elves and Minotaurs nominated their most powerful mage, Ista, and warrior Grul, to challenge the gods. By consensus the humans provided their greatest knight, Tomas, to provide leadership for the company.&#10;&#10;As one of the Everlasting, you summon heroes from the mortal world of Athien to the shadow plane (Between), so they can harvest souls at your behest. Souls that give you power and sustain your immortality. This is the game of Judgement.&#10;&#10;Judgement brings all the elements of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) video game genre to the table top. Powerful, diverse and fun heroes, neutral monsters, magical items and hero levels. These ingredients provide a truly amazing gaming experience like no other miniature game on the market. The game design team worked tirelessly for almost 2 years creating, testing and perfecting the core mechanics which ensure diverse, dynamic hero activations and a fast, flexible combat system. The icing on the cake are superbly detailed 54mm scale resin cast miniatures.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
