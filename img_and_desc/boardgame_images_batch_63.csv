That is a delusion. All I can do is provide you with cardboard pieces and a paper map, and instructions on what to do with them, and maybe some words of historical commentary. Can you feel the confusion and chaos, the reports, false and true, that filled British Headquarters when the counterattack hit ? Can you think what it was like to see the ranks of feldgrau figures appear two hundred yards away, peering through the fogged eyepiece of a gas mask into the back sight of a Lee-Enfield rifle ? I cannot tell you what was in the minds and souls of men who fought the battle. I'm no artist. I design wargames&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Through the mud and the blood to the green fields beyond.&quot; This quote, attributed to Brigadier General Hugh Elles, who led the Tank Corps into action at Cambrai, succinctly states the British objective-to penetrate the German trenches and break into their rear areas. The idea of a breakthrough to the green fields beyond had dominated Allied thinking since 1915. Cambrai was to be as close as they were to come before the final breakthrough of 1918.&#10;&#10;To the Green Fields Beyond is an operational level simulation of the Battle of Cambrai which lasted from 20 November to 7 December, 1917. There are two players, one commanding the British and the other the German forces. The game consists of three scenarios and a campaign game. The players should start with a scenario- the British Breakthrough is best- before attempting the full 17 turns of the campaign game. Players should note that each game turn in To the Green Fields Beyond requires many decisions, and will probably take between 30 and 75 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;To the Green Fields Beyond is uncommon amongst games in that both players get the opportunity to take the offensive. The campaign game provides opportunities for both sides to attack. The British Breakthrough and Battle for Bourlon scenarios have the British attacking, while the German Counterattack scenario obviously has them as defenders, although they can still often mount attacks as well.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the mapsheet represents 1250 yards from side to side. Each Game Turn is equivalent to 24 hours.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;Rules booklet&#10;400 Die cut counters&#10;1 34&quot; x 22&quot; Map&#10;1 Die&#10;&#10;"

There are many different card decks based on different subjects, e.g cars, planes, films, military jets, or TV shows. The decks are also available in the USA. Each pack of Top Trumps consists of a number of cards (usually 30 or 32), each of which features an item or character related to the subject of the deck; each card has a picture, some numerical statistics, and possibly some additional text. The pack is the size of an ordinary pack of cards so is readily portable.&#10;&#10;Deal out all the cards face down to the players. Each player holds their cards face up but may only look at their top card. The player to go first chooses the a statistic (usually a high one) from their top card, e.g. &quot;Top Speed 252mph&quot;. All other players read out the same statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.&#10;&#10;During a round, if 2 or more cards tie or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card. The winner of the hand also takes the cards that were placed to one side. The first player to win all the cards is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Familiarity with the deck is useful since the player will know which statistics are high (and, particularly, which cards have the absolute highest value for a given statistic).&#10;&#10;This game is sometimes paired in the same deck with The Game of Authors a.k.a. Quartets.&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to be the first one to get rid of your numbers by making examples. There are three kinds of tiles: Number tiles from 0 to 9, equal sign tiles, and math function tiles (+, -, X, and /).&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the number tiles are randomly drawn by the players until they have all been drawn. The function tiles are left face down to be drawn one at a time when its your turn.&#10;&#10;On your turn you try to make a math equation using your number tiles and the function tile that you drew this turn.&#10;&#10;Example you have numbers 0, 1, 4, 6 in your hand and you draw a + tile. On your turn you would  pick up an = tile and then play  4 + 6 = 1 0. The next player would then build off of the original equation either horizontally or vertically.&#10;&#10;"

The Casters could carve mystical symbols in the air with their hands and their breath. They called these symbols glyphes. Weaving combinations of the glyphes the Casters could twist reality and call upon the power of the elements. From thin air they could conjure mighty storms, raging fires, howling winds, and terrifying creatures. Some say the Casters could even manipulate time itself, bending it to their will. In their quest for power, the order discovered a chaotic quasi-element. Calling upon this chaotic element was dangerous and many of the order met their doom trying to wield it's power.&#10;&#10;GLYPHE CASTER &#10;&#10;For 2 to 6 players - Ages 10 and up Each set includes 8 glyphe dice (enough for two players) and instructions.&#10;&#10;A note from Paul - for $5 how can you go wrong?&#10;&#10;"

There are 5 white dice (par 4s), 2 red dice (par 3's) and 2 blue dice (par 5s). Each dice has the ability to shoot above par, par, or below par. There are as many formats as there are golf side games, but players typically play in one of two formats:&#10;&#10;Traditional Format:&#10;&#10;All nine dice are rolled--the player chooses at least 1 die, but can use more than one to count toward his/her 9-hole total. The remaining dice are picked up and rolled again. Players have the option of having multiple dice count toward their score, or choose as few as one and try to &quot;GO LO&quot; (shoot a low score--golf parlance).&#10;&#10;Golf Course Format:&#10;&#10;In this format, the players must follow along to the scorecard of their favorite course, or any course. If the first 9 holes (&quot;Front 9&quot;) at Pebble Beach are laid out in this order--4-4-3-4-5-3-4-4-5=36, then when the player begins by rolling all 9 dice, he/she must play the course &quot;in order&quot; by choosing two par 4's before he/she may then chose a par 3. Having to go in the order of holes on a golf course creates a different strategy and usually produces higher scores than the Traditional format.&#10;&#10;In all formats, tournament play is the most exciting--where players are playing against each other, and their scores are affecting other players' choices and strategies.&#10;&#10;A game primarily for non-gamers and sports nuts, which nevertheless is a very strategic, &quot;push-your-luck&quot; dice game. It is not just a matter of rolling dice and counting up your score; the requirement of keeping one or more dice each time you roll presents many interesting choices, depending on what your opponent has done, and what you already have kept for scoring.&#10;&#10;The game is sold online and in major golf shops and golf stores. Game includes a cup, nine dice, score pad, pencil, and rulebook.&#10;&#10;"
