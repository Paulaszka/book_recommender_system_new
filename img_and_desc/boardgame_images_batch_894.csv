The map is randomly populated with solar systems and gas clouds. In addition to the player-controlled solar systems, which are all inhabited by technologically advanced &quot;spacegoing&quot; civilizations, non-player systems are generated by the referee. These non-player systems vary by industrial level, military resistance, and spaceflight capabilities (if any). Spacegoing non-player systems have randomly determined race and culture characteristics which serve to impact the War Roll (a die-roll determination of whether a meeting between opposing spacegoing forces is peaceful or results in conflict). The War Roll is also impacted by the government types of the involved civilizations. Finally, the Referee's Manual includes rules for research and technology that allow solar systems to advance and develop more powerful weaponry and spacecraft, including improvements in spacecraft propulsion ranging from sublight to hyperlight speeds.&#10;&#10;The Player's Manual explains the various planet types, the process for planetary industrialization, and the planetary installations that players can construct. The details of spaceship construction and associated costs are set forth for the game's two general classes of vessels: warships and merchants. Three classes of troops are available to the players: combat troops, engineers, and android troops (also referred to in the rules as robot troops). The Player's Manual includes the game's rules for movement and combat. These rules cover both tactical space battles (with distinctions for sublight and hyperlight vessels) and man-to-man land battles. Both types of battles rely on tabletop-miniatures-style rules, with movement being simultaneous based on written orders. The game also allows for &quot;strategic combat&quot; on the galaxy map in the form of minefields laid in space.&#10;&#10;In addition to the rules booklets, the game requires hex sheets, paper/notebooks, pencils, two to four 20-sided dice, one (?) 10-sided die, and an unspecified number of six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Your fellow guild members look to you for leadership after fleeing the devastation, and you feel the incredible weight of that responsibility. Your beloved guild is a shadow of its former glory and despair threatens to overwhelm you. But you are determined and begin to plan your strategy to reclaim your homeland.&#10;&#10;In Alynthia&rsquo;s cooperative mode, a horde of Dragons has just destroyed the cities of Alynthia and built deadly Nests atop their ruins. You are among the survivors who have united to free Alynthia from the Dragons, so you take your turns simultaneously. You must band together to retake the land by defeating all Nests before the end of round 5. Don&rsquo;t wait too long - starting in round 2, if you don&rsquo;t defeat at least 1 Nest per round, Alynthia will fall.&#10;&#10;In the competitive mode, it has been years since Alynthia was first decimated by the Dragons. They still roam the land, but they are fewer in number and much less deadly. The time has come to turn your attention to other matters. You are competing against your fellow guild leaders to become the new leader of Alynthia, so you take your turns individually. To win, have the most Renown by the end of round 5, securing the support of the people.&#10;&#10;Whether you like working together, fighting your friends, or playing alone, Alynthia lets you play the way you want while seamlessly transitioning between modes. The diverse set of abilities and guilds plus a semi-modular board also ensures that each game will be different. Build outposts, slay dragons, and conquer the land as you seek to win the hearts of the people and lead them on the path to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
