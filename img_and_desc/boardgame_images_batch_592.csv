The game consists of four location boards and a number of character cards. Each scenario features a number of characters, hidden roles for these characters (serial killer, conspiracy theorist, friend), and some pre-set tragedies (murder, suicide).&#10;&#10;Each &quot;day&quot; (turn), players and the mastermind play three face-down cards onto the characters, then reveal them to move the characters around or affect their paranoia or goodwill stats. At the end of each day (turn), if the scenario has a tragedy set for that day, it happens if the conditions are met, i.e., certain characters have certain stats or are in a certain location together (or not together) with others. As tragedies happen, players loop back in time, restarting the scenario from the beginning and trying to deduce who the culprit was and why the tragedy occurred.&#10;&#10;The players win if they manage to maintain status quo &mdash; that is, if no tragedies occur to the key individuals &mdash; for a set number of days, within a set number of loops. If not, the mastermind wins.&#10;&#10;Tragedy Looper was originally released in Japan as &#230;&#131;&#168;&#229;&#138;&#135;RoopeR in 2011; the first english version of the game was released in 2014.&#10;&#10;"

If the player fulfills the requirements of the drawn Warzone card, he completes the mission and gains the Valour points and benefits listed on the card. A failed mission leads to loss of Life Points listed on the same card. Reaching 0 Life Points leads to the skipping of the next turn, and reduction of maximum Life Points by 20.

Central market mechanics allow players to compete by increasing or decreasing universal resource prices, while limited resources make each region of space a hotly-contested competition for colonies.  The game ends when the universe is totally explored--meaning if you're sitting in dead last without a hope, you can explore your heart out and rush the game to an untimely conclusion.&#10;&#10;Cosmos is very straightforward to learn, and a typical game takes around 30-45 minutes.

Each player has a deck of 24 cards, and in each of the six rounds, he draws a hand of four cards from this deck. Each player starts the game in Age 1 and adds the progress card of this age to his deck.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of a card phase, lasting 4-5 tricks among all the players, followed by an individual management phase. During the card phase, players try to (1) gather resources (which are on the cards) to pay for the needs of their civilization and to construct buildings, (2) avoid diasters, and (3) collect discoveries. However, the value of a player's cards are affected by which Age he occupies. In Ages 1 and 2, for example, his cards have no color, so they automatically lose to cards of players in Age 3 and above as those folks have discovered the awesome power of hue. What's more, in the primitive Age 1, you can't see the cards before you play them. That's how primitive you are! In Ages 5 and 6, a player can start using trump to beat out those in lower ages.&#10;&#10;The advantages in the card phase are balanced by the needs of your population, which is much greater in later ages. In each trick, each player collects one played card based on the value of their card played, and players then use the resources on these cards (food, tools and science) to satisfy the needs of their population, erect buildings (which supply additional resources), gain advantages (which can protect you from disasters or earn you victory points), or advance to the next Age of S-Evolution. Players score points each round depending on how well they meet the needs of their population, suffering penalties if they fail to do so.&#10;&#10;At the end of the sixth round, players score points for their sets of discoveries, and the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;"

But in order to do that, you need to hire some help and, ultimately, earn more than the rival circus that keeps hitting the same towns you do and draining your profits.&#10;&#10;Each player can hire performers for his or her circus from a common pool. Those performers each allow the player to roll one additional die for profit, from the lowly d4 to the mighty - but unpredictable - d20. But these performers can prove to be real divas. When a performer rolls a 1, he or she throws a diva's tantrum and has to be consoled - or he or she will quit. And if you're consoling one diva, you can't console another if they should have a tantrum, so choose carefully.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach $100 in savings wins. Play time takes about 15 minutes and requires at least one d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 to play. Counters for money are also helpful, but pencil and paper could work just fine. Enjoy it, and please let me know what you think!&#10;&#10;"

To do this, players can lay down melds of sets and runs; unlike other rummy games, however, you can't just lay down melds whenever you want. You must play a monster card first. Knowing when to play monsters is a key strategy, but you also have to figure out when to kill your opponent's monsters to prevent them from laying down their own melds.&#10;&#10;The numbered blood cards come in two colors: odd numbers are black and have a skull in the right corner, while even numbers are red and have a heart in the right corner. You can kill your opponent's monsters with a Kill card or a three-of-a-kind of skulls. With a three-of-a-kind of hearts, you can bring one of your monsters back to life. Blood cards can also be played as melds for points, and deciding whether to play for points or to kill your opponents becomes a key strategy in the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to play out his cards ends the hand, then everyone tallies his score. Whoever first reaches a preset point total wins!&#10;&#10;"

The board is just 3&times;4 squares, so the game is rather short. As for how to play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The tanuki moves one space orthogonally.&#10;     The kitsune moves one space diagonally.&#10;     The kodama is directly analogous to the pawn/soldier of Sh&#197;&#141;gi and can be promoted to a kodama samurai, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi (moving one space orthogonally or one space diagonally forward).&#10;     The koropokkuru is analogous to a king in Chess, except that he can win through promotion as long as it doesn't leave him in check.&#10;     Even on this 3&times;4 board, you are still able to drop in pieces that you captured from your opponent!&#10;     Unlike in Sh&#197;&#141;gi, you can drop a kodama for mate or have two kodama in a column.&#10;&#10;&#10;The expert version has a larger 5&times;6 game board with each player having eight pieces (3 kodama, 2 oni, 2 kirin and 1 koropokkuru).&#10;&#10;&#10;     The kirin moves equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.&#10;     The oni moves equivalent to the silver general in Shogi (moving one space diagonally or one space straight forward) and can be promoted to a super oni, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game also adds more rules from the full Sh&#197;&#141;gi game, in particular:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You win only by capturing your opponent's koropokkuru, not by reaching the opposite side of the game board.&#10;     You can't have two of your own kodama in the same column/file.&#10;     You can't drop a kodama for mate.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Japan Shogi Association created the rules for this game in order for players to learn important concepts in Sh&#197;&#141;gi, such as how to handle the generals effectively, why pawn promotion is so important, and how to mate the opponent's king with successive piece drops.&#10;&#10;"
