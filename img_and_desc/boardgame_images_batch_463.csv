The blocks are placed on the table same as dominoes, face down and are shuffled. Each player draws one block starting from the right of the dealer. When a Red block is drawn, the drawer neither puts or takes from the kitty. When Green block is drawn the player places one chip in the kitty. When a Yellow block is drawn the player places two chips in the kitty.&#10;&#10;&quot;TO WIN, the player getting the first three in a row of same color receives three chips from the kitty. The player getting first four in a row of the same color receives four from the kitty. The player getting first five in a row of same color receives all the chips in the kitty.

The face up symbols show the spoils of today's hunt.  &#10; The tiles are then divided by a unique mechanic: When it is your turn, you may either A) Take any number of tiles from the pool, or B) Claim that another player has been too greedy, taking all of that player's tiles, but returning at least one tile to the pool (you must of course show yourself to be a little less greedy).&#10;&#10;The next player without tiles then follows in turn. This way the size of the pool will gradually increase, and the round is over once the last player without tiles decides to take what's left in the pool.

A Pod can orbit around a pivot through any number of empty spaces or through outer space (off the board) provided it comes to rest on an empty space on the board.

Toss a coin to see who goes first.  Bowling team must use 4 overs of 'Fast Bowling', then 4 overs of &lsquo;Medium Pacers&rsquo; and then 4 overs of &lsquo;Spinners&rsquo;. For a 20 over game, overs 13-18 follow the same order in lots of 2 overs. The final 2 overs are the bowlers choice. Use your favourite players to compete against other favourites!&#10;&#10;Even include yourself in the team!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;&#10;Bowler throws 2 dice and the batsman follows the directions on the card. The batting team then throws 2 dice and looks at the appropriate card for the result.&#10;&#10;Example: 5th over (medium pace) bowler throws the dice and gets a 4 (inswinger). Batsman looks up Inswinger card and throws the dice. A6 is shown on the dice = 4 runs.&#10;&#10;The only time the batter doesn&rsquo;t throw the dice is on the number 8 Spinners card, which is an automatic 1 run wide.&#10;&#10;For this game it is recommended that no extra balls be bowled for extras such as No Balls and Wides.&#10;&#10;Commentate the game it is played and add your own comments if you wish&#10;&#10;"
