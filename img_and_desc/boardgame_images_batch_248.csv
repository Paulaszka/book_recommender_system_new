There are 51 territories (the states and the District of Columbia) in which to place the four colors of plastic chips (each representing &quot;an army of 1,000 soldiers). Set-up, by alternate picking of territories, and die roll combat is identical to Risk. The came contains 153 cards (infantry, cavalry, and &quot;governor&quot; cards for each of the 51 territories), and card play is significantly different from Risk, as a card from a stack of shuffled infantry and cavalry cards is picked every time a territory is conquered. If a player acquires both the infantry and cavalry cards for a state, the player is awarded the governor card for that state and immediately takes that state over. If another player has the other card, there is a one-die showdown to determine control. Play continues until all 102 infantry/cavalry cards are drawn, and the winner is the player with the most territories at that time. The game is well-made, with front &amp; back box printing, a mounted board, plastic insert, 153 cards, 6 dice, 4 sets of 64 plastic chips, and three rules booklets (English, Spanish, French).&#10;&#10;"

Every country is seeded with a token that represents one of eight different types of trade-goods. Players may pick up these tokens as they move their own pawn from country to country around the gameboard, and then collect payment for delivering the goods to a country where there is demand. Players spend their earnings to achieve a progression of game-ending conditions.&#10;&#10;"

Using plastic pieces and plastic targets players try to softly lob the pieces into circular targets. Succeed and score a point. The game advertises that it could be played outdoors but the pieces are just not sturdy enough for the pounding that an outdoor game would inflict on them and the pieces are so light that outdoor winds would play havoc with the game. Certainly best played indoors.&#10;&#10;

Game play shares similarities with Uno, in that players play one card at a time from their hands, which must match either the same species as the previous card, or the same number. In addition, there are a selection of special cards which cause an opponent to pick up more fish from the pool, or which can be used to change species.&#10;&#10;"

Instead of the Crown of Command you must battle your way through the Fortress of the Beast which is situated on a bridge which spans the board. Game's world is a bit more darker than heroic Talisman.&#10;&#10;The basic layout of cards etc is the same as in Talisman except that Strength is replaced with Might and Craft with Magic.&#10;&#10;A version of the game was later made without license by Phantom, a Russian firm.&#10;&#10;Sfera produced a second edition of the game, which changed the style of the cards, but kept the art. The board was recreated using photo art and new character art was used. Only the base game was produced.&#10;&#10;"

The map has a square grid superimposed, and movement is orthogonal.  On a turn, a player rolls two dice and may make as many moves with any number of ships as he wishes, up to the total value of the two dice, but not to exceed the value of one of the dice in the movement of any, single ship.  Unit types are troopers, fighters, transports, and mines.  Fighters automatically eliminate troop ships; fighter vs. fighter is determined by high roller.  Troops are carried by troopships, and may be dropped on planets; combat on planets is resolved as with fighters.&#10;&#10;Two sheets combine to form a 22&quot;x16&quot; mapboard.  121 thin counters are perforated for separation.
