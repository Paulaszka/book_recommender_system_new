JumPico is characterized by the fact that players advance their pieces while blocking the movement of their opponent's pieces, as in Backgammon. The first player to move 4 of his pieces to his opponent's side wins the game. Passing is prohibited, so a player with no legal moves automatically loses. Blank pieces can always be used with no risk as they always move one space and are thus key to creating a winning strategy.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#166;&#168;&#229;&#174;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#164;&#229;&#183;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#190;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#166;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#10;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#233;&#167;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#137;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#231;&#167;&#187;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#10;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

There are 20 tokens - one for each category in the game. The token must be kept secret from the other players. The first team to go then choose either to answer a question in the category on their token or to swap with one of the other teams, without knowing what they will get. If they answer the question that they end up with correctly, they will receive 3 points - a wrong answer does nothing. Scoring is kept on the included pad. This continues till all teams have answered a question. The last team will not have the opportunity to swap, as all other teams have used up their categories.&#10;&#10;Each turn, each of the teams have one opportunity to bezzerwizze one of the other teams question. This means that if the team does not answer the question correctly, the team that has bezzerwizze'd has a chance to answer it as well. If the first team answers correctly however, the other team will have wasted their chance to bezzerwizze this round. The number of points you get for bezzerwizzing and answering correct depends on when you choose to do it; if you choose to bezzerwizze after the category is revealed, but before the question is read aloud you will get 2 points for a correct answer. If you do it after the question has been read aloud, you will only get 1 point for a correct answer. If the teams that bezzerwizzet can not answer correctly either, the original team will receive the points.&#10;&#10;The turn order then switches one place and the process starts again. If there are fewer category tokens in the bag than the number of teams when a new turn is started, all of the tokens are returned to the bag.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the teams has 20 points (continuing the round to completion to allow other teams to reach 20 as well).

Vault is named after pole vaulting, which is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar. Vault is a derivative of Onager, by the same designer and uses a variation of its jumping mechanism (also present in Billabong, for example) that allows multiple directions to be used. It&rsquo;s like vector movement but without acceleration. Unlike Onager, Vault only works well on a square grid, as jumping directions are difficult to visualize in a hexagonal grid.&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;- A square grid with an even number of cells (recommended 10x10). Preferably checkered* for clarity, but this is not mandatory.&#10;- As many white and black pawns as the number of cells per side.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Each player has an allocated colour (Black or White). Fill your nearest row with pawns of your colour (one per cell).&#10; HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;White starts. Players alternate turns during the game until the victory condition is reached. On your turn, either walk or jump with one of your pawns.&#10;&#10;Walk&#10;&#10;Move one of your pieces to an adjacent empty space as a King in Chess.&#10;&#10;Jump&#10;&#10;In order to jump, choose 2 friendly pieces. One of the pieces then jumps over the other piece in the direction defined by both pawns, landing on a space beyond that is at a distance equal to the distance between the two friendly pieces before the jump was made (like a mirror). Notice that jumping is not restricted to orthogonal or diagonal directions.&#10;&#10;The landing space must be either empty or occupied by an enemy piece, which is then captured and removed from the game. A piece cannot land on a friendly piece. Pieces cannot land outside the board.&#10;&#10;Notice that the spaces between the jumping pawn and the landing space don&rsquo;t need to be empty. Also, captures can only be made by jumping.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;If at the start of your turn you have at least one piece on your opponent's back rank then you have won.&#10;&#10;If the above condition is not reached and you can&rsquo;t make a legal movement at the start of your turn, you lose. This rarely happens. Players may agree on a draw at any moment during the game.&#10;&#10;NOTES FROM THE DESIGNER&#10;&#10;This is intended to be the simplest game that uses this jumping mechanism. I&rsquo;ve decided not to use Onager&rsquo;s stacking mechanism (in order to make is simpler for turn based online play and also playable with non-stacking pieces) or the multiple jump (as it would be almost impossible to think ahead).&#10;&#10;As a variant, you can use the stacking mechanism of Onager.&#10;&#10;(*) On a checkered board, the jumping piece always lands in a space of the same colour as the starting one.&#10;&#10;"

The group asked the Captain to take the boat way out to sea, away from any lights so they could party under the stars and maybe see the Northern Lights put on a show. When the boat set out, it was a clear, pleasant evening and the sea was calm. The Captain did mention something about a possible storm front that was due to move in early the next morning.&#10;&#10;For hours, the party aboard the boat had enjoyed themselves. Then someone noticed the stars had all disappeared, and the stillness of the sea was quickly turning into gale force winds. The storm front had moved in faster than anyone could have expected.
