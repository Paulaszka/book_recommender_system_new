It&rsquo;s designed to be easy to play. You choose a family and build the family.&#10;&#10;Homia is a Memory-style game, where you look at a face down card and try to remember what kind it is. Until you find a homestead tile (also called a &quot;family pad&quot;), you will only memorize where the various tiles are, and put them back face down on the table. Once you finally discover a family pad, you take it into your area. The family pad has various symbols that represent different parts of a household, such as fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, and pets. The color of the symbol tells you what kind of other cards you will need to complete your family pad. If your family pad has a green symbol, for example, you need to collect one &quot;father&quot; (green background) card to add to your family pad. If there are three yellow symbols on the family pad card, it means he has three daughters, so you'll need to find three of the &quot;daughter&quot; (yellow background) cards to complete your family. If you have a good memory of the cards you looked at before finding your family pad, it will be much easier to find the members of the household required to complete your family pad. Whoever completes their family pad first is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

Consequently after system, with diagrams and illustrations. Consequently after many rewrites it was decided to create one book as a game system and another as a simple note book. Both over lap each other. It did seem necessary to describe the tactical techniques in some great detail. Fortunately there is plenty of information on how these weapons were used on the battlefield. This availability of information made it possible to transform information into a realistic game system. However incomplete as it may be, the rules still effectively cover only a small part of the late ground war.&#10;&#10;The game system includes supportive diagrams, illustrations, tactical notes and Quick Reference Sheets (Q.R.S.). The Turn Sequence and Turn Phases, once understood, make play easy and fast. The system has two Turn Sequences one of which is optional and the other mandatory. Six basic Turn Phases move the game along to a conclusion. Manufacturers will be glad by the fact that the game is best played using lots of figures and models. Let us be glad that there are sources for figures and models.&#10;&#10;Basic units are 12 figures for a platoon with four platoons making a company and three to four companies making a battalion. Figures can be mounted individually or on multiple stands. Morale is based on unit size and applicable modifiers. Movement is with a D-10 die roll for both infantry and tanks. Transport and field artillery movement is determined by the roll of a D-6. There are two Turn Phases in which players can shoot. Hand-to-hand combat is easily performed. Players are always encouraged to adjust the rules to suit their perceptions.&#10;&#10;To me, Yanks and Tanks captures the flavor of the late war. I hope your games will be hard fought, yet fun, and the game system competes well with other similar systems.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Bike Route includes everything from the majestic Alhambra movie palace to the soon to be completed Powerhouse Science Center on the river. All the wonderful things that you think about when you imagine Sacramento are included. Come play in the Sacramento that never was but will always exist in our hearts.&#10;&#10;Bike Route has a long history and has been in development for over 10 years. Originally called Connections the game was never published and looked like it would end up on the pile of great ideas that never were. My daughter AR kept it alive by insisting that we play. &quot;Papa lets play Connections&quot; she would say and we would play. Despite the weak art the game was good and we kept enjoying the drama of the game. Eventually we decided that it should be brought back with new artwork and Bike Route was born. Connections was at heart a game about building connections between places and it seemed a perfect fit for a game about building bike routes. The idea took off and it has kept going ever since.&#10;&#10;I was play-testing Bike Route at the main library with a local family and the boy across from me said &quot;We live here...&quot; and pointed at the map. &quot;and I have been to the Zoo.&quot; he continued, indicating Land Park at the bottom of the board. Watching him I realized that a lot of kids know places in Sacramento but their mental map doesn't really connect them together. It was great to see the gears turning in his head as he saw all the places in town fit. He also knew DOCO and Old Town and quite a few other places. This was moment of affirmation; I realized that Bike Route could also bring back that great sense of place that is getting lost. Google guides us from place to place without any context or sense of relationship. Yes you can turn left and turn right but where are you?&#10;&#10;I travel a lot for work and I am always happy to come home. Ususally I go to a town that is excited about what they are doing but in Sac we have it in spades. It seems that every week brings something new to our doorstep. Mabye a brand new artist or shome classy hippy selling tea. We have to recognize this exciting moment we are living in and celebrate it. Bike Route puts this fantasitc idea down on paper and freezes this instant so we can stop and savor what we have. Take a break from the hustle and bustle and enjoy a great game with family and friends. Recognize how lucky we are and enjoy it.&#10;&#10;Bike route is for people who love bikes, games and Sacramento.&#10;&#10;"

Each player places this stack of cards face down in front of them. Place one card from the deck face up in the center of the playing surface.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:  Choose a starting player. That player draws the top card from his/her stack and plays it on the playing surface following card placement rules, and then calculates and records his/her score for the turn. Play then continues clockwise. When all players have placed all their cards, the round ends and the cards are shuffled back into the deck. The number of rounds corresponds with the number of players, with each player having an opportunity to go first.&#10;&#10;Card placement: Cards may be placed adjacent to other cards in play, but they must be played so that at least one square aligns with a square on an adjacent card. Additionally, they may be played so that the cards partially overlap, as long as the squares align. When cards are played, at least one square must lie over an empty space (you cannot occlude 9 squares with any given card.)&#10;&#10;Scoring: When you place a card, any instance in which a square of a certain color lies next to a square of that same color on another card is worth one point.
