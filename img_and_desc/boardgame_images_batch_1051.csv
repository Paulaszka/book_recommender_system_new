During that period Rommel&rsquo;s forces dashed across Cyrenaica and made it to the Egyptian frontier. However, he was not able to take the critical port of Tobruk defended by the stubborn Australians. With superior tanks, combined arms doctrine, and 88mm Flak guns (used as anti-tank weapons) the Axis forces successfully fought off two counterattacks from the east&mdash;the Allied operations called Brevity and Battleaxe. Later in the year, before Rommel could make his planned assault against Tobruk, the Allies launched Operation Crusader and drove the Axis forces back to their original starting positions at El Agheila.&#10;&#10;North Africa &rsquo;41 allows players to study the campaign and refight it with their own strategies. The game includes a detailed map of the Western Desert and a meticulously researched order of battle.&#10;&#10;The game uses the simple Move-Fight-Supply game system developed in Normandy &rsquo;44 and Holland &rsquo;44.

Go Stop decks have 4 or 5 joker/wild cards; Flower Battle has 3 wild cards that are doublers and a blank card for you to customize.&#10;3. Flower Battle has options for scoring such as Wild Boar Hunt (players put their scoring sticks in a box; the player with the boar card wins the sticks) and Clear the Ground (if you collect the last 2 cards on the table, you also receive a plain card from each opponent's collection).&#10;4. Point values differ slightly; in Go Stop, collecting all 5 brights typically gives you 15 points. In Flower Battle, you receive 10 points.&#10;&#10;The original version comes with a deck of cards and a pouch of color counting sticks for keeping score.&#10;&#10;"

This means that players, in order to optimize their missions and not waste valuable time, must learn to predict the future position of planets and start planning rocket launches in advance, just like real space agencies.&#10;&#10;Development tree is divided into three branches: space tourism, base construction and sabotage. Players have to manage their budget on an ongoing basis, so they don't run out of funds at the crucial moment of the space race. In addition, each of the space agencies: USA, Russia, Europe, China and Japan, has its own unique bonus.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The son of the great Henry V has not lived to fill his father's shoes. England has lost the Hundred Years War, and mighty lords amass lands and wealth rivaling the King&rsquo;s own. Henry IV left the door open for any such powerful lord with good pedigree to reach for the throne, and the best candidate is Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York.&#10;&#10;Mounting tension over the Crown leads to armed clashes, under the excuse of freeing the king from his evil counsellors, and finally ignites the Wars of the Roses that William Shakespeare would immortalize in his plays:&#10;&#10;A Yorkist rebellion that succeeds in placing Edward IV on the throne and exiling the Lancastrians to Scotland and France.&#10;A civil war pitting Warwick the Kingmaker and King Edward&rsquo;s brother Clarence against the King and his other brother Richard Gloucester.&#10;The reinstatement for a few months of Henry VI and the invasion from France by his son and wife leading to a final contest between Richard III and Henry Tudor (later known as Henry VII) and the Battle of Bosworth that ends the Plantagenet dynasty.&#10;Treason, bravery, political maneuver, and a cast of memorable characters mark one of the most intense and divided periods of English history.&#10;&#10;In Plantagenet&mdash;the newest volume in Volko Ruhnke's Levy &amp; Campaign Series&mdash;players lead one of the two factions across the three main periods of war, as individual scenarios or the entire Wars of the Roses.&#10;&#10;Designer Francisco Gradaille adds overall and local political influence to Volko&rsquo;s medieval operation system to reflect the ever-changing loyalties of the time while keeping play familiar to fans of the Series. Players will create and maintain a network of allied lords and nobles in order to obtain the provender and coin needed to supply and pay their armies. As ravaging and looting will damage each side&rsquo;s reputation, each faction will strive to convince cites to join its side. Great battles will seek to kill or capture enemy lords&mdash;perhaps even a king. Two kinds of operational moves will be in play: the military and the political.&#10;&#10;In the end, when the dust settles and all arrows have flown, one rose will sit on the throne. White or Red, York or Lancaster, gather your troops and banners and join the fight.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

So you can get into trick-taking incredibly quickly.&#10;     It will always be dealt the same number of cards.&#10;     The announcement of a trick to be taken is an inferior element, which exists only in the team variant.&#10;&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of mythical creatures and have fun dueling!&#10;&#10;"
