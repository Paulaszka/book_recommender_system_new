If the ends of the dominoes add up to a multiple of five, the player adding the domino scores one (1) point for each multiple of five (5) (IE: if the ends added up to ten (10), the player would score two (2) points).  The first player that plays their last domino from their hand, adds up the count remaining in their opponent's hand and scores the total divided by five (5) (IE: if the opponent had a count of fifteen (15) in their hand, the scorer would score three (3) points).&#10;&#10;Five-up is played to a score of 61, and is usually played with a Cribbage board to keep score.&#10;&#10;Five-up is unique in that every double domino played is a possible &quot;spinner,&quot; and plays can be played on all four sides of a &quot;spinner.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules for Five-Up were standardized and popularized in the 60's by Dominic C. Armanino, who wrote at least four books on Dominoes. He was a strong advocate and PR agent for this version of the game.  Life magazine called this version, A big new go for the humble domino.&#10;&#10;"
