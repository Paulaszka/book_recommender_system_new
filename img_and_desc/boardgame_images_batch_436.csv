Players are working together to gather clues, kill monsters, close gates and eventually defeat the Great Old One (Cthulhu).&#10;&#10;Players will select characters, each with a unique special ability.  During a player's turn they will roll 5 dice with unique symbols on each side, after rolling they have the option of re-rolling 3 more times.  If the &quot;Monster&quot; symbol is rolled on a die it is locked and cannot be re-rolled.  If 3 Monster symbols appear a new gate opens and a monster appears in Arkham.  The other sides of the dice include movement points, clue tokens (used to close gates), healing, and combat symbols (used when fighting the monsters guarding the gates).  Each player must carefully choose how to use their symbols to move around and try to close and collect six gates.  If six gates are open on the board the players automatically lose..  However if the players manage to close six gates Cthulhu awakens and players must try to defeat him with their remaining items and abilities.&#10;&#10;This game is in no small part inspired by Felbrigg Herriot's (FNH1) wonderful Dune Express game.&#10;&#10;"

However, a character who is pointed out as being the witch may lose the trust of the rest of the players in the game and  may be executed.&#10;&#10;So it is important to gather information, but at the same time it is important to cast doubt on the other characters by spreading witch rumors, or by trying to avoid being accused of being the witch yourself.

Each player takes the role of a faction (or race) from the universe.  In the base game, the choices are Klingons and Federation.  Each faction has a number of ships (on Clix dials similar to the Heroclix line of components) of varying ability and with a corresponding &ldquo;size.&rdquo;  Fleets of ships are drafted to a given size total which reflects the victory points required to win.  Thus, larger fleet sizes lead to higher point (and longer games).&#10;&#10;Players then &ldquo;shuffle build&rdquo; a deck of command cards.  Choosing four decks from a set of ten decks per faction.  Each deck has a unique flavor or theme, with corresponding major characters.  For instance the Klingons have a deck themed around larger ships and imperial domination and Gowron is a central character.  The four decks chosen will help to set the player&rsquo;s strategy for winning.&#10;The ships chosen have physical stats like weapons, shields, engines, and sensors. They also have mission totals for science, influence, and combat missions.  These determine the kinds and numbers of each kind of mission cards the player draws to form a mission deck.  Completing missions gains the player points, which will win them the game.   Missions could be as simple as damage an opposing ship that is larger than your own (combat), to as complex as claiming the spaces connecting your command post to your opponents (influence). Thus a player&rsquo;s chosen ships sets the types of missions they will need to earn points and the deck they build determines the way they will complete missions.&#10;&#10;Points can also be earned for non-mission actions such as destroying a ship or building a starbase.&#10;&#10;The game itself plays out on a randomly built board of hex cards, called sectors that start the game unexplored.  As each ship progresses through the sector, the cards are turned face up, revealing what is in that part of the sector (a Class-M planet, a Class-J Nebula, empty space, etc...). There are additionally random events that can occur when exploring, which usually correspond to a single episode of a series (for instance one encounter is &ldquo;trouble with tribbles.&rdquo; Some of these encounters also give victory points.&#10;&#10;Overall, the game can best be thought of as playing out an entire season of Star Trek with the conflict between players representing the major story arc and the turns, missions, and random encounters representing individual episodes.  Players will move their ships, explore space, complete missions, play cards to upgrade their ships (and staff them with famous and not so famous crewmembers), or boost their stats in combat.  Combat, while important, is not the sole path to victory, with the mission cards being the primary factor (some of which will encourage combat).  The style of game will depend heavily on individual player decisions, but no matter what, it will feel like Star Trek.&#10;&#10;"

To calculate red card limit divide initial red card count by 2. Round up to nearest integer. For example, in level 7 red card limit is 7:3=3.5, round up to 4. If you pick a red card and red card count is lower than red card limit, you lose. You win 1 point times multiplier for each green card during main game, 2 point times multiplier during 1st replay, 3 points times multiplier during 2nd replay, and so on. If you complete all 90 levels, you play the game again.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Yellow cardsYellow cards are cards that are used automatically to avoid decreasing of a red card count if you pick a red card. Levels 41-65 come with 1 yellow card on the board and levels 66-90 come with 2 yellow cards.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Money tree&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Red card count &#10;         Multiplier&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1 &#10;         1&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         2 &#10;         2&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         3 &#10;         3&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         4 &#10;         4&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         5 &#10;         5&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         6 &#10;         6&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         7 &#10;         7&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         8 &#10;         8&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         9 &#10;         9&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         10 &#10;         10&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         11 &#10;         15&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         12 &#10;         20&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         13 &#10;         30&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         14 &#10;         40&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         15 &#10;         50&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         16 &#10;         100&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         17 &#10;         200&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         18 &#10;         300&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         19 &#10;         400&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         20 &#10;         500&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         21 &#10;         600&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         22 &#10;         700&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         23 &#10;         800&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         24 &#10;         900&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         25 &#10;         1000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         26 &#10;         1500&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         27 &#10;         2000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         28 &#10;         3000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         29 &#10;         4000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         30 &#10;         5000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         31 &#10;         10000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         32 &#10;         20000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         33 &#10;         30000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         34 &#10;         40000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         35 &#10;         50000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         36 &#10;         60000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         37 &#10;         70000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         38 &#10;         80000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         39 &#10;         90000&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         40 &#10;         100000&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;"

Race your competitors to invent as much as possible, or to speed through the production process.  But don&rsquo;t forget to register your patents.  Otherwise you may lose influence in the industry.&#10;&#10;GAME OVERVIEW&#10;Era of inventions is played over 8, 9 or 10 rounds &ndash;depending on the number of players&ndash;. In each round players attempt, by using action tokens, to use the following actions at the wisest, such as: building factories, buying or producing goods, and making and producing new inventions. The number of action tokens is limited however(the time is short), and thus you must choose the best of many actions, given your situation. The player who uses his actions, money, goods and development points at the best will earn the most influence in the Era of Inventions and win the game!&#10;&#10;"
