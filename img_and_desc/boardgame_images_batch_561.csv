(The exception: In a five-player game, one color can be played twice.) Whoever plays the highest card wins the trick &ndash; except that the three least valuable cards in the game (1, 2, 3 of yellow) win the trick if one of the three most valuable cards in the game (16, 17, 18 of red) is present. Whoever wins a trick leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;Each color has its own small deck of scoring cards, and when a player wins a trick, he takes a scoring card of the corresponding color. The red color, for example, has highest playing cards on average (cards 5-18, compared to yellow 1-13), but least valued scoring cards for a trick. However, once three tricks are taken with the same color, the scoring cards of that color are depleted and players take golden &quot;joker&quot; scoring cards, worth the most points. Therefore you might want to keep high cards of a frequently winning color in your hand in order to maximize your points &ndash; but the round ends as soon as a player cannot play a card due to the restrictions on which cards can be played in a given trick.&#10;&#10;Players tally their points, then begin a new round, with the game lasting as many rounds as the number of players. In the end, whoever tallies the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"

In addition to Gold Coin cards, the action cards in the game each have up to three effects: Ability, Activate, and/or Reaction.

On another player's turn, players may play a card with a Reaction effect to counter an opponent's card. In addition to these three actions, during their turns, players may move Gold Coin cards around within their play areas (placing a Gold Coin card on top of a Coin Purse card for protection, for example).&#10;&#10;Example cards include Dagger, Cutpurse, Pickpocket, Lock Box, Guild Hall, Traveling Merchant, Lock Pick, Thieves' Tools, and the Dirty Thief.&#10;&#10;Using these and other cards' Abilities, Activates, and Reactions, players both seek to steal the Gold Coin cards from their opponents--adding them to their play area--and protect their own Gold Coin cards from being stolen.

Alternatively, Spyrium can be purchased, but the material is rare and expensive, and players are constantly scraping for money.&#10;&#10;Only those who from the beginning of the game manage to increase their regular income or their base of permanently employed workers (who can be used again and again to raise money) will be flexible enough to get their hands on the important end-of-game buildings to generate many VPs.&#10;&#10;The circular nature of the game is flexible as each player can decide for himself when to move out of the placement phase and into the activation phase. With the two tracks in the game, those involved with delivery during the worker phase can then be used to raise money, to purchase an adjacent card, or to work on their own in an idle factory. All of these things are important, but in the end only the player who has dealt best with the lack of money, workers, and Spyrium will win.&#10;&#10;"

But some of them will be so popular that only a die duel can decide who gets to wear them!&#10;&#10;Components: The game consists of 24 catwalk cards, 12 Miss Magix cards and a die (apply stickers before first game).&#10;&#10;Summary and aim of the game: Each round, players try to win as many catwalk cards as possible by using one of their Miss Magix cards. If more than one player wants the same catwalk cards, there is a die duel. The player who owns the most catwalk cards at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The 24 catwalk cards are shuffled and put in a face-down stack. Each player gets one Miss Magix card per colour (orange, pink, turquoise). &#10;The game is played in several rounds. &#10;At the start of a round, four catwalk cards are placed next to each other, face up. If cards are left over from the previous round, fill up to a total of four. &#10;Then, each player chooses one of their three Miss Magix cards and puts it down, face down. The colour of the Miss Magix card shows which catwalk card(s) you want to gain this round (i.e. if you put down an orange Miss Magix card, you are going for the orange catwalk card(s)). &#10;Players then turn over their Miss Magix cards simultaneously. If you are the only one to have chosen a particular colour, you immediately win that card. Players who were going for the same colour compete in a die duel.&#10;The die duel: All players taking part in a duel. Players take turns rolling the die. A star symbol means that the player stays in the duel, the Winx logo means the player is out of the duel, and a player who rolls the heart symbol isn't just out of the duel but can't use his/her currently used Miss Magix card in the next round (i.e. he/she only has two cards to choose from during that round). A duel ends when all participating players have rolled at least once per die rolling round and there is either only one player left (then he/she gets to take the catwalk cards the duel was about) or all duel participants are out (then neither of them gets to take the cards, they stay out for the next round).&#10;The game ends when the stack with the catwalk cards has been used up. The player with the most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

One player starts and rolls a die (numbered 2-7) and announces the result. The next player rolls the die and adds to or subtracts from the result (never going below 0 or above 15, so there is not always a choice). When a player reaches 0, 8 or 15, s/he can flip over the respective card. When a player calls a number of a card s/he already flipped over before, another player can say &quot;thank you&quot; and pick up a chip. A chip can be used to add or substract an additional point. The first player to flip over all three cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;- Der Budgetausschuss:&#10;Same as above, but any player can shout out the result. First player to shout 0, 8 or 15 and covers an additional card with his/her hand gets to turn the respective card over. &#10;A player who announces a 5 or 10 must flip a card back.&#10;&#10;- An der B&ouml;rse:&#10;Same as Expertenkommission, but the number at the bottom of the die counts.

When 0, 8 or 15 are reached, the active player can change the position of one corresponding card with another one. If the number is reached by using the number at the bottom of the die, the players may flip over two grey cards which are already in the correct position. &#10;A roll of 2 that cannot be used gives the players a lobby handicap (flipping over a colored card). A second handicap leads to flipping over two cards, etc. When four lobby chips are collected, the game is lost. With an unused 7, the players can collect ecology chips with which they can counter the lobby chips.&#10;&#10;The game was published in Austria and tries to show finding unusual solutions.

On a turn, the active player discards a card that matches either in number or color the card on top of the discard pile. If a player can't legally play, she must draw a card; if she can play this card, she may do so.

Four types of violet cards can be played on top of anything, and they either give you another turn immediately, force everyone to draw one card, force your left- and right-hand to race for the buzzer (with the slower player drawing a card as a penalty), or force everyone to race for the buzzer!&#10;&#10;Empty your hand first, and you win a chip.

After a person draws a card, if one of the buttons on the newly revealed card matches the color of the top card on the discard pile, players must race to hit the buzzer, with the last player to do so drawing a penalty card.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;&#10;     Crazy Eights&#10;&#10;&#10;"
