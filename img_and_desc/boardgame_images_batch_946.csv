Finishing Time, the after-worker placement game for 1-6 players.&#10;&#10;In Feierabend, you are playing a team of workers (female, male, and non-binary, too). Each day you leave work stressed and look for some fun in the evenings &mdash; but thanks to a 70-hour work week and a low income, you don't have many possibilities for relaxation. Sure, you can head to the pub for drinks, go on blind dates to find a partner, or fish or jog outside, but this is not a good work-life balance. It's a rat race.&#10;&#10;If you really want to relax, you need a higher income for you and your fellow workers &mdash; and the women on your team should be paid the same as the men. You want to work fewer hours each week, and taking a vacation would be good, too. Let the union help you fix this depressing lifestyle. This change might stress your employer, of course, but they already earn enough to be able to de-stress their life.&#10;&#10;Each turn, place one (or more) of your workers on any available after-work spaces to gain relaxation. Taking leisure time doesn't cost anything, but going to town for amusement requires you to spend hard-earned money. Going on vacation for real relaxation is out of the question until your employer is convinced to grant your workers some time off. When your workers meet partners, you gain access to even better relaxation options.&#10;&#10;At the pub, workers can relax and have drinks in front of the bar &mdash; or they can earn additional income and suffer more stress by working a second job there. You'll want to visit the union office, too, to strike for better working conditions. If you have enough strike tokens, you can force your employer to reduce working hours, increase your income, close the gender gap, or even send you on vacation.&#10;&#10;After all your workers have been placed and taken their after-work actions, they are forced to return to work. You place them all on your factory where they then suffer stress, earn income, and gain strike tokens from the union, depending on the current working conditions.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered once a team gathers at least 40 relaxation. (In this game, relaxation is considered to be a currency.) Your workers are then placed on after-work spaces and go back to work one more time, after which the most relaxed team wins Feierabend.&#10;&#10;Create a better (that is, more relaxing) life for your workers and their partners. Which team will relax the best and win the game? But really every team is a winner since they fought for better working conditions. Workers unite!&#10;&#10;"

All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, using the dice however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will roll 2 dice and then use those dice to draw a shape with a certain dig type on the dig site. You dig up a fossil when it is completely surrounded (orthogonally) by shapes you have drawn.&#10;&#10;- Roll 2 dice - Roll the 2 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference. Of the two dice rolled, one will be used to determine which shape and the other die will be used to determine the type of dig.&#10;&#10;- Use dice to choose a shape and a dig type&#10;&#10;Choosing the shape: Using one of the dice, choose one of the pentomino shapes coordinated with that number. There are twelve shapes, with a choice of two shapes with each die-face number.&#10;&#10;Choosing the dig type: Using the other die, determine the dig type. There are three dig types.&#10;&#10;Example: You roll a 2 and a 5. You can choose one shape, and can choose from four shapes; the two shapes next to the 2 and the two shapes next to the 5. You also have a choice between two dig types; the V from the 2 that was rolled or the diagonal lines from the 5 that was rolled. You decide the best play for your current dig site is to choose the L shape with the 5 die and then use the V dig type with the 2 die.&#10;&#10;- Draw shape and fill that shape in with the Dig type&#10;Shapes can be mirrored, turned, and flipped, as long as they are still the same shape.&#10;Shapes can only be placed in open, non-fossil spaces. You can place shapes over the bonus star. If you do, choose and circle one of the bonuses to gain (you can use bonuses in future rounds).&#10;&#10;- Check to see if you dig up a Fossil(s) - Once a fossil is completely surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right. Not diagonally) then you score that fossil! Circle the number in a lower scoring area that corresponds to the fossil you dug up. If you use all of the same dig type for a fossil, you earn bonus points.&#10;&#10;Repeat these steps each round (rolling 2 dice and placing a shape with a dig type) until 20 rounds have been completed.&#10;&#10;- Earning Bonus points for using the same Dig Type - if you were able to use the same dig type for a fossil, you also gain the scoring bonus. Circle the extra smaller circle with the +number. If there is more than one dig type used for a fossil, you cannot gain the bonus.&#10;&#10;- Bonus Stars - when you place a shape over a bonus star, you gain a bonus! Choose one of the four bonuses at the top-left of the page. The four types of bonuses are One Square Anywhere, Switch Shape, Switch Dig Type, and +1 Point. Each bonus can be gained up to four times in one game.&#10;&#10;One Square Anywhere - At any time, place a 1x1 square on any empty square that does not contain a bonus star. Fill in the square (as the dig type). You cannot get the dig type bonus score when a filled-in square is used to dig up that fossil.&#10;&#10;Switch Shape - Choose any shape for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)&#10;&#10;Switch Dig Type - Choose any dig type for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)&#10;&#10;+ 1 Point - Worth one point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;End of Game: After you have completed the 20th roll/round, total your points earned from each fossil dug up, adding in bonuses from fossils dug up with the same dig type, and finally adding points if circled from bonus stars. The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

I quickly realized that the night market was a microcosm of Taiwanese culture. So, like many travelers, I made a point to visit the major night market in each city I visited to sample the regional dish that made each market &ldquo;famous.&rdquo; What I did not realize until after a few years of living in Taiwan is that night markets are ubiquitous. Every neighborhood has one. You could walk through a seemingly quiet alleyway and stumble across an absolute gem of a night market that features the city&rsquo;s best beef noodles. This is what I wanted to capture in the design of this game: that the food of any small night market can easily compete with that of the major ones.&#10;&#10;While I could not possibly include all the famous dishes that Taiwan has to offer, I chose a few iconic ones mixed with my personal favorites. I hope this game gives you a glimpse of an aspect of Taiwanese culture that I fell in love with in my time living there, and more so, I hope that you will be able to experience a Taiwanese night market yourself one day.&#10;&#10;Thanks for playing!&#10;-Adam Zwain&#10;&#10;"

Huge planar gates are opening and hordes of powerful creatures are pouring into the land to fight the final battle for dominance. There can be only one winner!&#10;&#10;Ostium is a turn-based, deck building card game. Each player uses their planar gates to summon creatures that fight to destroy the gates controlled by other players. The creatures use their abilities and fight. Each creature has its own set of abilities, which grow more powerful, if the creature is supported by other creatures from its clan. The creatures can also fuse with energy channeled directly from a planar gate to deal crushing damage to the opponent&rsquo;s gates or creatures.&#10;&#10;Each turn has two phases. In the first phase, the player can bring more forces to the battlefield and use special abilities of the summoned creatures. The second phase is combat, where all the extra powers, channeled energy, and clan synergies lay waste to the enemy forces.&#10;&#10;The player can summon creatures directly to the battlefield (and place them in attack or defense rows) or the discard pile. The order in which the cards are placed in the deck, drawn, and played can decide the outcome of the game, since neither the deck, nor the discard pile are shuffled. The way the creatures are placed on the battlefield also greatly affects their abilities and power.&#10;&#10;Ostium was initially designed as a duel game, but you will also find solo mode and 3 player match rules described in the official game rule book. A typical game usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Each land tile has the name of a location on it and players are looking for the ones that match their quest cards.&#10;&#10;In the basic rules, on each player's turn they can move from one tile to an adjacent tile and draw a land tile if none exists in the direction they wish to move. Then they draw a wild encounter card and resolve it. Defeated wild encounters can be traded at the Keep for treasure or character improvements.&#10;&#10;A player that moves on to a land card with a name that matches a quest card can reveal the card to draw from the Quest encounter deck instead of the wild encounter deck. If they defeat the encounter they have completed the quest, collect the treasure, and place the quest card face up in their play area so everyone can see how many quests they have completed. However, if they fail or flee the quest a red marker is placed on the location and the quest is now considered and open quest for anyone.&#10;&#10;Only treasure that is safely deposited at the keep counts towards victory so you have to get it back to the keep safely.

It&rsquo;s a game about making decisions, picking the best DISC, applying SKILL, avoiding TROUBLE, hoping for LUCK, and making the PUTT.&#10;&#10;Just like Disc Golf, the aim in Final Nine is to complete your chosen set of HOLES in the lowest number of THROWS possible. It's for 1-4 players, ages 10+, has 108 cards, and takes 30+ minutes to play (full 18). It comes with 2 sets of rules: Standard and Battle, 3 Levels of Play: REC, AM, and PRO. You can also play an easier game using half the pack, or full which is harder. The card swapping and play system allows for a rapid turnover and randomness of cards, allowing for massive replayability.&#10;&#10;To play, lay out the HOLE cards as a board sized grid course (9 or 18 cards), or stack the HOLES in order/shuffled. Each player receives 9 cards for their HAND, made up of DISC and ACTION cards. Swap two cards out at the beginning of a new HOLE. Play a DISC card to match the HOLE GRIDS and find a safe landing spot. Add SKILL if you, can then draw the next ACTION card to see if your THROW was a success, or you end up with a DEVIATION or CALL. If TROUBLE has effected your THROW, add LUCK to nullify it. Once you are within 2-3 GRIDS of the BASKET, use a PUTTER to complete the HOLE.&#10;&#10;Final Nine is like a little fun Disc Golf course in your pocket. It's for those times you can't get to the course because of weather or injury, for those who already play, and those who would like to learn more about the sport.

Also includes a punchboard with 10 bounty tiles and rules card.&#10;&#10;Citizen Pack - 8 card pack adds 2 copies of  4 new citizens with unique powers.&#10;&#10;Reeve Pack - 5 card pack adds 1 new starter citizen card for each player.&#10;&#10;Monster Pack - 4 card pack adds 1 new monster with unique rewards per lair.&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;Margraves of Valeria is a hand-building worker-placement game set in the fantasy world of Valeria. It's the fifth stand-alone game in the series and brings the familiar feel of the previous games (with icons, characters, and easy turns) while building on familiar mechanics you'd expect (off-turn bonuses, multi-use cards, and resource-management).&#10;&#10;You are a Margrave, a military commander tasked with defending the land of Valeria and building magical Ward Towers at cities.  Knights in Valeria can be commanded by you or your fellow Margraves to slay monsters or activate locations in an effort to gain influence over the 4 Guilds: Worker, Soldier, Shadow, and Holy. As you gain influence, you'll cross thresholds that will earn you privilege tiles which give you bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, you'll earn victory points based on how much influence you have over a Guild and how many icons you've gained of that Guild. The Margrave with the most victory points at the end of the game will be named a Duke or Duchess and given their own province to protect and grow!&#10;&#10;Turns are deceptively simple as you only get to play 1 Citizen card from your hand. Each card can be played for action icons in the pennant (top-left), power text (at the bottom), or played face-down to perform one of the two actions on your player board (Recall your cards or Build a Ward Tower).&#10;&#10;Key features include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hand Building - Much like deck-building, you are drafting cards into your hand increasing your powers, victory points, and options.  &#10;    Multi-use Cards - Each card can be used in one of four ways, leaving you a lot of decision-making room to execute your strategy.&#10;    Worker-Placement - Each time you move your Margrave or a Knight into a location, you activate the power of that location much like a worker placement game. &#10;    Shared Workers - The Knights on the game board do not belong to a single player (anyone can use them) so be careful not to setup your opponents with powerful turns.&#10;    Resource Management - You have limited storage spots on your player board and using them effectively (without wasting tokens) is key to winning the game. &#10;    Hero Tombs - As you send Knights into battle, they die glorious deaths and are sent to tombs where you can collect bonuses in a well-integrated mini-game.&#10;    Influence Track - Gain influence over the 4 Guilds by moving your markers across the tracks which will earn you more victory points at the end of the game for icons you collect.&#10;    Fantastic Art - As with previous Valeria games, the Mico has really outdone himself by creating a rich and dynamic world full of color and life.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

All actions  of the Soviet commander Zhukov and subordinate units are strictly  controlled by the game rules. As Paulus, your goal is to save the trapped army in the Cauldron while at the same time cooperating  with the high command (OKW) to preserve the integrity of the entire  southern front in Russia. Each turn you perform various types of actions  within the pocket. Die rolls and rules determine the strategic  situation and strategy employed by Army Group South outside the pocket,  specifically in terms of the commitment levels of the Luftwaffe (air  force) and General Hoth's relief force.&#10;&#10;Each turn represents one to five days, depending on the  level of activity. The entire board represents territory  approximately 35 by 65 miles. German units typically represent  divisions, while Soviet units are officially armies that were usually  the rough equivalent of a German division. Each supply point represents about 50 tons delivered per day. Each evacuated wounded factor represents 1500 men.&#10;&#10;This war game is big in scope (and lettering) and can be  played in a (long) evening. Rather than standard 9/16&quot; or even 5/8&quot; inch  counters, this  game utilizes our custom 3/4&quot; square counter die to create large, thick  counters that are easy to see and manipulate. The base game  also  contains a map with easy ergonomics, and a well tested game system that  approaches its subject with enough abstraction to keep  the game tight,  but enough detail to do justice to history and create an array of  complex decisions.&#10;&#10;The map represents the city of Stalingrad and surrounding area and contains 64 areas for regulating movement and combat. Each area is linked to every other area it is connected to by a line.&#10;&#10;The player controls all vacant areas inside the German Perimeter marked on the map. The player also controls all areas containing German units, regardless of their location. Any vacant area outside the Perimeter or occupied by a Soviet unit are under Soviet control. No area may contain units from both sides.&#10;&#10;Game counters represent combat units and information markers. German units are blue, their Rumanian allies are yellow, Soviet units are red, and information markers are white. The number of counters provided in the game is deliberately limited.&#10;&#10;Cards are used to determine outcomes for weather, offensives, as well as individual attacks, and provide random changes to the game state as well as randomised situations.&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts with 3 meeples of his color and can do the following actions: walk up to 2 spaces apart, the maximum height that a miner can climb or descend is 2 tiles high. Use or draw up to 2 cards and the main action: mine a tile just below one of your miners. Mining means revealing the tile that can be a precious tile that will be worth points to the player, a natural disaster or a monster. All effects are resolved immediately.&#10;The game takes place in turns and each player can take each of the actions listed above on its turn.&#10;There are 3 colors of tiles, from the lightest and superficial, with less dangers and less riches, to the darkest and deepest, with more dangers and riches and also where is the only diamond tile. When any player takes the diamond, the game is over and the points are counted. Whoever has the most points wins the game.&#10;The diamond is worth many points but does not guarantee victory.&#10;To help move around the board, players can use a deck of equipment, including bridges and ladders that increase the possibility of locomotion, as well as dynamites that speed up and increase the danger for miners.&#10;It's a fun family game that can be quite chaotic, in a good way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Developer description&#10;&#10;"

Andrew Carnegie and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1848. Although he started his career as a telegraphist, his role as one of the major players in the rise of the United States&rsquo; steel industry made him one of the richest men in the world and an icon of the American dream.&#10;&#10;Andrew Carnegie was also a benefactor and philanthropist; upon his death in 1919, more than $350 million of his wealth was bequeathed to various foundations, with another $30 million going to various charities. His endowments created nearly 2,500 free public libraries that bear his name: the Carnegie Libraries.&#10;&#10;During the game you will recruit and manage employees, expand your business, invest in real estate, produce and sell goods, and create transport chains across the United States; you may even work with important personalities of the era. Perhaps you will even become an illustrious benefactor who contributes to the greatness of his country through deeds and generosity!&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 20 rounds; players will each have one turn per round. On each turn, the active player will choose one of four actions, which the other players may follow.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build the most prestigious company, as symbolized by victory points.&#10;&emsp;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The Government arrested most of the leaders and tried to ensure the mail service ran on time!&#10;&#10;So, is there a game in this? &#10;Well of course there is, perhaps not as evenly matched or equipped forces but as a good example of asymmetrical warfare where a regularly trained army faces a peasant mass. Likewise, the incoherent nature of the United Irishmen is best portrayed via dice rolls rather than player decisions and that all players should be British Lord-Lieutenants defending their County, gaining prestige and gaining the support of the central government at Dublin Castle.&#10;&#10;Included in the game is a novel mini-campaign system for four fictitious Irish counties struggling to destroy risings in their counties. &#10;There is also a neat system of creating one-off battles with context.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
