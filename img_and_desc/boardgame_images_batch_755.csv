Take on the role of a dauntless explorer and plunder these catacombs of their secrets and spoils. Build your catacomb as you go, seeking finds and surviving horrors. End your story before the evils of the catacomb devour you all!&#10;&#10;IN TENEBRIS LUX is a game for 1-4 players ages 13 and up, and can be played in about 45 minutes to an hour. &#10;Players rush to explore and resolve personal quests, called narratives, before their opponents can resolve their own, or the dark catacombs close in on them, ending the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, each broken into 3 Steps, with several Phases.&#10;&#10;STEP 1: BREATHE The first Step adds Rooms to the Catacombs, by drawing them from a random pile. This builds up the game board out of playing card sized map pieces, or Rooms. This step also has a phase allowing Explorers to change their gear, referred to as Equipment or Finds&hellip; this is critical as these important items strengthen an Explorer so that they may deal with the dangers to come. Following phases allow an Explorer to adjust their card hand and play any non-room cards, if so desired.&#10;&#10;STEP 2: SEEK The second step allows Explorers to actually explore and navigate through the Catacombs, or growing game board.  This dangerous course allows Explorers to search for new Finds and gear. More phases allow for adding extra Rooms, or cards, onto the board, moving around from card to card, and interacting with Room Cards in order to complete Naratives, or the game&rsquo;s objectives. This is the Phase where Explorers are most at risk of stumbling upon Horrors, as they are actively exploring the Catacombs.&#10;&#10;STEP 3: SURVIVE In Step 3 Horrors, the game&rsquo;s many monsters in the dark, may attack your Explorer! Canny and brave Explorers may also strike out and attack each other in hopes of thwarting each other&rsquo;s progress in pursuit of personal Narratives. This phase resolves each combat one by one, and adjusts health and loot bodies.&#10;&#10;Basic combat is simple. As the attacker, role one of the game&rsquo;s 14 included dice, and add it to your chosen Trait (Grit, Wit or Daring).  The Defender rolls one die and adds it to their same Trait, as they defend along the same lines as the incoming attack. Whichever result is highest wins.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Combat Reference Card&rdquo; will take players through any extra steps, notably the way in which rooms impact the outcomes with rolls in combat. Each Horror and Explorer features an affinity with different Room types, this gives an edge or disadvantage in combat. Be careful of the Room you land on, it will have dire consequences!&#10;&#10;After each Step is resolved a player finishes their turn and, moving clockwise, the next player goes, and so on. The game is ended when one player completes their randomly drawn Narrative objective, all Explorers are killed, or the Doom Counter (the Game&rsquo;s timer) has run its course, sending the catacombs crashing in on the hapless Explorers.&#10;&#10;In Tenebris Lux comes with 13 Jumbo Explorer cards, 4 jumbo Combat and Turn Cycle reference cards, a full color rule book, 24 Horror cards, 18 Equipment cards, 21 Find cards, 12 Narrative cards, 32 Room cards, 3 Great Room Jumbo cards, one Jumbo Doom Counter card, 14 Dice, 13 Double Sided Explorer counters with 4 stands, and a counter for each Horror as well as many counters to help record progress for Narratives.&#10;&#10;"

And once the new pope is elected, the richest player wins&mdash;just like in real life.&#10;&#10;The goal in Habeamus is to amass more money than the other players, while electing a new pope. Every player has one vote, and there are three non-player cardinals with a vote each as well. During their turns, players can place bribes face-down on the non-player cardinals in the middle of the playing field. These cardinals will vote for whomever promises the largest bribe when the vote starts.&#10;Each player also has a vote that they can use for themselves, or sell to other players. Every player can make hidden or open bribe offers to other players. If, during the vote count, a player accepts an offer by another player, that bribe goes into their account. However, if they do not accept the offer, the player making the offer gets the bribe into their account. In this way, players will have to balance their offers to other players and make sure they themselves sell their vote for a good price. To shake things up a bit more, a player can increase the papal salary, or play actions to change the bribes already on offer.&#10;Once all cards have been played, the votes are counted. If a pope is elected, he will receive a salary bonus into their account. Then, every player counts their money and the richest player wins.&#10;&#10;"

The brutal murderer wanders around the village and preys on honest villagers. Who is the heinous monster?&#10;&#10;Rocca Monster is a hidden role/social deduction game for 3-6 players. Each player is dealt three villagers which are placed on the table in front of them. One of the villagers in the game is secretly the monster. All players close their eyes and count to ten, during which time the player with the monster card places a six sided die on a villager of their choice. After the count is finished all players open their eyes and see who was attacked in the night. That player rolls the die, and on a roll of 1-4, the villager on whom the die was placed is killed. On a roll of 5 or 6, the villager survives the attack. After the murder (or attempted murder) the players discuss who they think the monster is, and then use their voting cards to vote for which villager they want to accuse of being the monster. Once a single villager has the majority of votes their card is turned over and it is revealed whether they were the monster or not. If they were the monster then the other players win! If they were not the monster then their card is removed from the game and play continues. Another night attack occurs, followed by another round of discussion and voting. This cycle continues until either the monster successfully kills half the villagers (at which point the monster player wins the game), or until the players successfully identify the monster (at which point the monster player loses and everyone else wins).&#10;&#10;"

Players step into the role of village farmers, who must use their feisty canine companions to help them herd back the lost flocks.&#10;&#10;Ewetopia is charming, fast-paced, easily-to-learn, and hard-to-master. With warm, friendly graphics that have appeal for kids, it will also appeal to older audiences with it&rsquo;s deceptively tactical game play: A strong denial game, board control, and a playing field that can change with every turn means Ewetopia enjoy plenty of play-time with old and young alike.&#10;&#10;Players command their trusty dog around a 5x5 grid filled with tiles containing numerically ranked sheep, pushing rows and columns of them, adding the tiles that get pushed off the grid to their collection. The dogs are very fast and will always move at least 2 squares during their turn, so although they can be made to change direction after their 1st move, they can&rsquo;t then move back into the square they just came from: Players will need to plan their turn to avoid collecting the wrong tiles or ending up out-of-position.&#10;&#10;Opponents&rsquo; dogs can&rsquo;t be pushed and will create obstacles on the board, but if this happens, or if a player wants to create a better move for themselves, fences can be built in the way of the charging sheep, diverting their path in a direction of the player's choice. Since these fences remain in the ground until the end of the game --and act the same for every player-- the result is a maze-like meadow where creative, zigzag moves aren&rsquo;t just possible, but become the norm.&#10;&#10;Adding to the brain-twisting mix are special tiles, including:&#10;Motivating Bones: When collected, can be consumed at any time to &ldquo;motivate&rdquo; a dog to move an extra square. Useful to push your dog to get a rare sheep, or to force an opponent to make tough choice if their dog is in a bad position.&#10;Wild Sheep: A mythical breed with technicolor wool, these sheep can count as any rank at the end of the game, making them especially versatile.&#10;Wolves: A snarky, stenchy wolf-pack have sneakily donned sheep costumes in order to blend into the herd. Their own rank, having them at the end of the game will reduce your score by stinking up your other sheep&rsquo;s wool.&#10;Wood Carts: Contains enough lumber to build an additional fence on the board when traded in, and may be used immediately after being collected.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, points are awarded based on sizes of unbroken, numerical sequences AND sets of same-ranked sheep, allowing players to pursue different paths to victory if their original plans are foiled. Point values scale logarithmically with size, meaning a single big set or sequence will always be better than several smaller ones. After separating their sheep into the largest sets and/or sequences possible, totaling their values --and subtracting points for wolves-- the player with the highest score is the victor!&#10;&#10;"

General MacArthur still favored the more westerly route through the Philippines and had support amongst the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

There were several reasons that the Americans finally decided to invade the Marianas: Firstly, it was the most direct route to Japan, Secondly, they could base B29 bombers there which could bomb Tokyo, Thirdly, Saipan would be the first piece of prewar Japanese soil taken during the war. Lastly, the American planners hoped that they could draw the Japanese fleet into a decisive engagement. With all these reasons, a battle for the Marianas was inevitable.&#10;&#10;On 15th June 1944 71,000 American Marines and Infantry attempted to make the plan work. 32,000 dug-in Japanese attempted to stop them.&#10;&#10;Saipan &ndash; The Bloody Rock will be the first game to utilize the new Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 2 maps.

The first player to defeat all three columns or force the opposing player to draw their last card, wins the game.&#10;&#10;During the player turn you can choose to dig and defend with your card, moves cards from one column to another or attack with long range or close combat. None of these are without their risks and weighing up the risk vs the strategic gain is part of the decision making elements of the game.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast, simple but very brutal with all the dice rolls required on the cards - no charts or looking up in the rules. Damaged cards are suppressed first before being removed from the game and can still make a free saving throw on the dice to keep in the fight.&#10;&#10;"

While the goal is simple&ndash;to be the first player to place all of his/her tiles onto the board-the shapes of the tiles and additional columns make winning quite tricky.

It was designed by two authors and one artist from Lausanne (Switzerland) and released in November 2016, after a long year of development.&#10;&#10;The game is inspired from an old 56 classic cards game known as Tamalou, Raspoutine or Gabo. It is played in several rounds where the players will avoid cumulating points. Each of them starts with 4 cards face down and looks only at 2. By replacing some of their cards with drawn ones and playing capacities, they will progressively gain knowledge of their game and the ones of their opponents, whom they will steal cards from.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, the players&rsquo; scores are marked down and added to the ones of previous rounds. A game ends when one of the players reaches 100 points, the winner being the one who has the least. For a shorter game, a maximum score of 50 points can be set.&#10;&#10;The theme is post-apocalyptic, the illustrations being humoristic creatures and heroes inspired by old movies.&#10;&#10;"

Experience the exciting journey from the Garden of Eden to the Promised Land. Meet Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses, David and Goliath and all the Biblical Buddies characters.

This journey includes both setbacks and rewards with the ultimate goal of reaching the Promised Land.&quot;&#10;&#10;Biblical Buddies is a roll-and-move game, with each player working towards reaching the end of the track first.  Many spaces on the board have instructions to either help you move forward faster or to go back, lose a turn, etc. As players traverse the board they will read about many different biblical characters. A provided information booklet allows the player to find out more about each character and the role they played in the biblical stories.&#10;&#10;"

The game models the full order of battle that could be expected in 1980&rsquo;s wartime, from multi-regiment Soviet Tu-22 Backfire bombers to multiple US carrier groups.&#10;&#10;The game is card driven, with each card providing points to move units or trigger special events such as &lsquo;KGB Assassinations&rsquo; and &lsquo;Space Shuttle&rsquo;. There is also a reaction mechanic where most cards can be used in the other player&rsquo;s turn to perform a spoiling event such as &lsquo;Raid Aborts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Friendly Fire&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is detection. Task Forces can only be attacked once detected. By contrast, land air-bases can always be attacked &ndash; their enemy knows where they are. The race to detect opposing Task Forces begins as soon as they enter potential striking range of units such as the formidable Soviet bomber formations, or perhaps the Soviet&rsquo;s submarine fleet which, whilst it has considerable strength, cannot effectively detect enemy forces without help from its comrades.&#10;&#10;NATO must not only deliver convoys, but also protect its allies! Norway will be hard pressed, as will Denmark. Both will require urgent reinforcement. In the Mediterranean Sea, Soviet forces must be halted by naval aviation strikes. In the deeper seas, NATO may enact it&rsquo;s promised attack on the Soviet nuclear deterrent and the Soviets may attempt to respond. Perhaps the Typhoon SSBNs will flee under the Arctic ice to await doomsday, or hole-up in the White Sea. Perhaps the Soviets will use nuclear weapons and scatter those NATO forces that are no-doubt determined to bomb the Soviet&rsquo;s Kola Peninsula bases.&#10;&#10;The game models Politburo approval (Soviet leadership) through a stability mechanism, and whether the Soviets feel they can reduce New York to cinders through the use of &lsquo;First Strike Points&rsquo; &ndash; these allow the use of things like chemical or nuclear weapons. The game has spies, technological theft, satellites, B-52&rsquo;s, special forces and Soviet spy trawlers..&#10;&#10;Complexity:  6 out of 10 (medium)&#10;Solitaire suitability:  6 out of 10 (medium)&#10;Time Scale: Each turn = 1 day&#10;Map Scale:  Each area represents 500 nautical miles square&#10;Unit Scale:  Each counter represents 10 ships, 3 submarines, one squadron or regiment&#10;Number of Players: 2&#10;Playing Time:  1-3 hours for scenarios and 8-16 hours per campaign game&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    2 map&#10;    4 countersheets: counters are a mix of 1 inch, 5/8&Prime; and &frac12;&rdquo; markers&#10;    2 decks of 55 playing cards&#10;    6 double-sided player aids&#10;    2 single-sided player aids&#10;    1 rules and scenario booklet&#10;    10 ten-sided dice&#10;    1 box and lid set&#10;&#10;&#10;(from publisher's website)&#10;&#10;&#10;The errata file, which is updated as we find them is here https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2264466/errata-thread&#10;&#10;Vassal Module is available here http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Blue_Water_Navy&#10;&#10;"

You can declare &quot;Siege&quot; by arranging 5 cards next to the castle. You can earn a castle if your opponent does not have five cards at his next turn in the siege declaration. However, in case he managed to place five cards in his side of the castle sieged, a decisive battle will be held to win the castle by the stronger combination of cards. A player who wins 3 castles first wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Fleets traveled to Pearl Lands to transport new red shiny Pearl resource to our solar system, an adventure that was not possible before the use of Pearl extensively in every part of space technology. And the gift of Pearl Lands was not limited to Pearl! A green rain made of grain, discovered on a Pearl Lands&rsquo; planet, created a new energy source for space technologies, and a curious little yellow flower with beautiful petals provided Mana, a seed to be cultivated with utmost care. So, with these three new resources previously unknown to mankind, space travel to the farthest points of the Pearl Lands galaxy became a reality, and with the establishment of colony after colony Pearl Lands has become a new home for mankind.&#10;&#10;Of course, war has never ended. With the use of new technologies, it just became more sophisticated. Fights for planets turned into a fight for resources, whether by using fire power or trade channels. Prosperity was never enough for mankind. There was always more to gain, and more to develop. Now it's your turn to join the race. Trade, fight and build future technologies. Power is a beautiful thing, so make sure you have it all&hellip;&#10;&#10;Pearl Lands is a 2-4 player resource management strategy game with a sci-fi theme in which you compete to build three main resource buildings before other players. It&rsquo;s a fast paced game that gets more and more intense with each passing turn.&#10;&#10;The game has different strategy elements like attacking opponents to steal their resources, trading resources and using universe cards to change the course of the game (sometimes just slightly and sometimes drastically). Its combat mechanics is similar to Risk, while trade aspect gives it more like a Catan style strategy element. However there is no tile or troop movement factor that complicate things: it&rsquo;s designed to be fun and straightforward.&#10;&#10;Pearl Lands is full of surprises: the game can turn even at the last round. However it&rsquo;s not a game of pure luck. The player with long term winning strategy will definitely have the upper hand, and most likely will be the target of other players banding together against her. Alliances are of the utmost importance. Cunning players will find the game to their liking, but utilizing only the art of deception may not be enough to win the game. Sometimes desperate measures like a kamikaze attack to destroy five resource crystals by sacrificing an attack ship can change the balance of power. And buying universe cards can pay off greatly if you get one extra attack or defense die, or get to change the resource setup on the board to sabotage an opponent's game plan.&#10;&#10;"

Parents pick from the Parents deck of cards, filled with phrases parents might say to kids such as &quot;This playroom is a positive pigsty!&quot; Kids get to choose from the Kids deck filled with things kids might say such as &quot;What a bummer, brother.&quot; Players read the phrase as best as they can to their teammates, but it's not so easy to do as the timer counts down and the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. The laughter continues as players try to decipher what in the world their teammate is trying to say, and must correctly guess the phrase in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"
