One player commands the Axis powers, the other the Allies.&#10;&#10;Players maneuver their armies on an area map of Europe, fighting for control of key victory cities and critical resources.  Air, naval, and ground units are all involved.  Battles are fought when enemy units clash in the same area.&#10;&#10;The early war 1939-1941 is driven by the Axis, but gradually the Allies become stronger and usually take the initiative by 1943.  However, the game need not unfold exactly like history.&#10;&#10;The French may survive 1940, the Germans may invade Britain.  Germany may attack Russia in June 1941, or attack earlier, or later, or not at all.  The Soviets may attack Germany first which was likely their plan.&#10;&#10;The USA might enter the war in 1942, perhaps earlier, perhaps later.  All of these decisions are made by the players, influenced by Diplomatic events that are controlled by game events.  Invading neutral countries such as Norway or Belgium has consequences.&#10;&#10;"

The ideal number of players is four, but it can be adapted for three or five by removing one or two of the number 2 cards for a total of 51=3*17 or 50=5*10 cards.&#10;&#10;The game is a fixed collection of several short games and the winner is the player with the lowest total score. There are slight variants of the exact composition of included games and the scoring, however all but one are always trick-taking games while the last one is a variant of the game Fan Tan. All games start by dealing the entire deck so that each player receives the same number of cards. Common for all the trick-taking games is the requirement to follow suit if possible. The player of the highest card (ace being the highest) in that suit takes the trick and starts the next one. If a player lacks cards in the suit on the table he plays any one card of his own choice.&#10;&#10;Most Jazz variants consist of a selection of four to six of the following trick-taking games plus the final game of Fan Tan. The provided suggested penalty points provide for a balanced four-person game.&#10;&#10;1. &quot;Spades&quot; or &quot;Clubs&quot; &#10;A trick-taking game where the aim is to avoid taking cards of the specified suit. (2p each)&#10;&#10;2a. &quot;Tricks&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot;, or &quot;Minus&quot; &#10;Take as few tricks as possible. (2p each)&#10;2b. &quot;Plus&quot; &#10;Take as many tricks as possible. (-2p each) This seems to be a rare variant to include.&#10;&#10;3. &quot;Honors&quot; &#10;Avoid taking honor cards, i.e. 10, J, Q, and K. (2p each)&#10;&#10;4a. &quot;Jacks&quot;&#10;4b. &quot;Queens&quot; &#10;Depending on the variant, one should avoid taking either jacks or queens. (5p each) Some variants play both the Jacks and the Queens games one after the other, others play only one of them.&#10;&#10;5. &quot;King of Hearts and the Final Trick&quot;&#10;Avoid taking the very last trick as well as the king of hearts card. Some variants also give penalty points for the fifth trick. (10p each, sometimes with an extra penalty for taking the king of hearts as part of the final trick.)&#10;&#10;6. &quot;Solitaire&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Fan Tan&quot;&#10;The final game is Fan Tan or a version thereof. One common rule specifies that the player having the 7 of diamonds always goes first by playing this card while another variant is started by normal clock-wise order and with any number seven card. The starting player is often allowed/required to play an additional card if possible. In each suit the 7 is played first followed by the 8 on one side and as the third card the 6 on the other side of the 7. As soon as these three cards have been played the ascending (9-K) and descending (5-A) runs of the suit are played independently of one another on top of the 8 and 6 cards. A player has to play one and only one card on his turn if possible. The game ends when a player runs out of cards. The other players score 3p for each remaining card of their own.&#10;&#10;"

157767,,"This is a project of an 8th grade school class in Altensteig/ black forest/ Germany. The game is about an old tradition in this city: On christmas eve big fires are lit on two hilltops in the city. Torchbearers light their torch on one of the fires and spread out in the darkness to make a torch chain across the city.&#10;&#10;The game contains a gameboard, playing cards (people: the torch expert and torch novices, several kinds of wood needed for the torch fire = a tree and a wood base, then the wood that is to be stacked), action cards for the players to select their appropriate actions, 5 playing pieces, a torch point marker, one d6 die for dice duels and one die for the actions (one action, two actions, rainy day, unhappy face = sick torchbearers). Then there is the fire itself considering of a stack, a base and 14 wood pieces (actually from plastic).&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each player gets a pawn, action cards, and 3 people cards and 3 wood cards. The game has two phases: first the fire is prepared: Torch bearers have to be found, the wood has to be gathered. Then the wood is stacked. When 14 stacks have been reached (the point marker or one of the player pawns reaches past 14 wood on the game board) the fire is ready to be lit. There is a final dice throw, and then the winner is the one having advanced the furthest up the game board, meaning the one who stacked the most wood.&#10;&#10;For the first phase a fire master is chosen - the first one rolling a 6 with the d6-die. Then each player chooses an action - gathering wood or getting torch bearers. The action die thrown by the fire master determines if an action is successful (no rainy day, no sick persons are rolled) and if successful if a single or double action is possible. If more than two players want the same action they roll the d6 to determine who can have a go.&#10;&#10;The fire master title changes clockwise to the next player each time a turn is finished.&#10;&#10;In the second phase the players - who have to have at least 3 torch bearer cards, one of them being an expert, first plant the tree, then the wood base, then wood stacks. For this they need to have the appropriate type and amount of wood cards. More than two people wanting to do the same roll it out with a d6. The action die determines if an action is successful (no rain), if torch bearer cards must be given up (sick persons) or an action can even be done twice. For a successful action the player pawn is moved one space up on the game board, for a double action two spaces. The point marker moves up one space up too (but only one even when two actions are made). Once the full stack of 14 is reached, either by a player pawn or indicated by the point marker, the game enters its last phase. To maximize their score each player can roll the d6. The player furthest behind has as many die rolls as are players present (e.g. player in 4th place can roll 4 times). If he/she rolls a 6 he/she can move up 4 spaces, player in 3rd place can roll 3 times and move up 3 spaces when rolling a 6 in these 3 rolls). Then the game ends and the player who is up the furthest is the winner.&#10;&#10;Apart from the cards the game contains a 3D-woodstack to visualize the fires progress.&#10;&#10;"

The game is played on the light colored squares, of which there are forty-one, including all four corners.  The squares on two opposite corners of the board are marked with a diamond shape and are called the Diamond King squares.  Each player has one of these corners of the board closest to him or her.  The next two light squares following the edges of the board to left and right are marked with rings and are called the King Squares.  Each player begins with twelve stackable checker pieces, each with its crown side facing down, on the nine closest light squares and on the middle three squares of the next row closest to the center of the board.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving their pieces with the goal of eliminating their opponent from the board.  The ordinary pieces may move to one adjacent square vertically towards the opponent, or horizontally to the left or right.  Upon arriving on any of the opponent's King squares, a piece is turned over to become a King, and may now also move back towards his own side of the board.  Upon arriving on the opponent's Diamond King square, a piece has another stacked upon it with its crown side up and becomes a Diamond King.  Such a piece may move in any direction to an adjacent square, including diagonally.&#10;&#10;Pieces are removed from the board as in Checkers, by jumping over them to an empty adjacent square.  Pieces may capture in any direction in which they normally move.  Jumps may be continued as long as there is opportunity to capture more pieces in a single move.  Capture is compulsory, but a player is not required to inform his opponent of a missed opportunity.  Players with choices of more than one capture may choose which to take.&#10;&#10;The first player to remove all of his opponent's pieces wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

By this, the players can block or attack the opponent or save their own tiles.&#10;&#10;The clou: &#10;Each time a tile is captured, two new, additional barragoon pieces have to be put on the board. By this, the board becomes more and more crowded and the risk to get locked up increases. At the same time the chance to beat the opponent increases as well.&#10;&#10;"

Unfortunately, humanity was no match for its own creations and armies of terrifying monsters were soon out of control in their destruction of civilization. In their final global nuclear strike, humanity accomplished two things: They wiped themselves out, and they created a highly mutagenic environment where the monsters could thrive.&#10;&#10;This is the world at the start of Teratozoic, a light deck-building game. (From greek: terato-, of or relating to monsters, -zoic, of a (specified) era, or having a (specified) animal mode of existence.) Each player has their own deck of monster parts (their gene pool), and will attempt to make the best of the mutations they draw from a common deck to come out on top in the battle for survival. At first the monsters will be more random mutation than representative of a stable gene pool (players will draw most of the cards for each hand from the common deck), but by the time players reach the Teratozoic Era, their monsters will be built entirely from the best traits they've been able to retain each generation.&#10;&#10;The dominant species in this new era (the final winner of the game) will be the one with the most robust gene pool&mdash;the player who can create the biggest, most impressive monsters at the end of the Teratozoic Era.&#10;&#10;"

Since I had no experience planning wedding party games, I went online to look for ideas, and found plenty of them that were extremely lame. I knew Nicky deserved better. I was playing a lot of Cards Against Humanity at the time, so was inspired to create a card game that honors the glorious institution that is matrimony, while also preparing my friend for the all frightening realities and ceremonial absurdity of humanity&rsquo;s most fraught life-long commitment. The game I made for Nicky on my laptop and home printer was as hilarious, embarrassing, depraved, and satisfying as marriage itself. So I decided I should share it with everyone.&#10;&#10;The game is simple to play: one person reads a question or fill-in-the-blank card aloud to a group of friends. Each player then gives an answer card that they think best responds. The reader picks the response they like best. The questions and clues are both a parody and a celebration of all our bizarre cultural hang-ups around weddings and marriage, and funny enough to make champagne squirt out your nose.&#10;&#10;"

Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince's visit. However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!&#10;&#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself. Players declare goods they wish to bring into the city, goods that are secretly stored in their burlap sack. The Sheriff must then determine who gets into the city with their goods, who gets inspected, and who may have their goods confiscated!&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be seen as an honest merchant? Will you make a deal with the Sheriff to let you in? Or will you persuade the Sheriff to target another player while you quietly slip by the gate? Declare your goods, negotiate deals, and be on the lookout for the Sheriff of Nottingham!&#10;&#10;Sheriff of Nottingham is the first game in the Dice Tower Essentials Line from Arcane Wonders.&#10;&#10;"

Like a subliminal force, the signal led various alien races toward the star system TAU CETI. Many civilizations were already on the brink of collapse, and had already left their deteriorating home worlds behind in search of resources, peace, and solidarity.&#10;&#10;As new civilizations arrived in the TAU CETI system, they settled among the planets, terraforming them into more hospitable worlds. With this mass migration a new alliance was quickly formed, known as the TAU CETI Authority, which encouraged diplomacy among the different cultures and emerged as the new economic power.&#10;&#10;Trade began, with each civilization utilizing their strengths and comparative advantages to maximize productivity. Heralded among the civilizations, a sense of friendship, economic prosperity and peace enriched the star system.&#10;&#10;But all is not well. Soon after forming the alliance, unprecedented crises afflicted the colonized planets, causing civil unrest and economic disharmony. The fragile new alliance&rsquo;s existence is now being threatened!
