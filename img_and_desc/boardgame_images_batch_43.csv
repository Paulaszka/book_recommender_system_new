The battle marked the first and only encounter of history's two most renowned generals, Sir Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, and Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France.  A brutal day-long French assault against the British held ridge brought Wellington's army to the brink of defeat.  By later afternoon, however, the arrival of Wellington's allies tipped the odds decisively against the French; Napoleon chose to stake his empire on the outcome of a final attack by his most trusted troops &ndash; the Imperial Guard.  Wellington's Victory is played on an innovative game map composed of four 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; map sections on which significant differences in ground contours are differentiated by color.  There are five distinct contour levels depicted on the map as well as an extremely accurate survey of all battle field terrain features including Hougomont, La Haye Sainte, and almost every other farm and dwelling, woods and orchards, streams and ponds, and raised and sunken roads.&#10;&#10;Each of more than 500 French, Prussian and Anglo-Dutch combat and command units are fully identified by battalion, regiment, brigade, division and corps designations as well as numerical game values which differentiate each unit's strength, effectiveness, and mobility.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a fifteen minute Game-Turn.  Each mapsheet hex represents a distance of 100 yards.  Each Strength Point represents 100 infantry or cavalry troops or one gun or howitzer within an artillery battery.  Each Game-Turn employs a unique, asymmetrical, sequence of play in which Players alternately participate in a series of Phases covering activities which include the execution of chain of command mechanics (such as activating and committing reserve formations and initiating cavalry charges), rallying disordered and routed units, executing facing and formation changes (including a repertoire of infantry formations such as column, line, square and open order or skirmish formation), regular and grand tactical movement, and finally executing artillery and small arms fire as well as infantry and cavalry shock command.&#10;&#10;The Fire and Shock Combat mechanics which decide the battle were also designed to yield realistic results without sacrificing playability.  Fire resolution requires no arithmetic calculation since each unit fires separately.  The Relative Firepower Table used to resolve Fire Combat is a new type of CRT which directly interrelates the strength, formation and quality of the firing unit with the formation and terrain cover employed by the defending unit.  The Shock Combat Table is also unique in that it employs an &ldquo;odds&rdquo; comparison to account for Troop strength differences between the attacker and defender and a &ldquo;differential&rdquo; comparison to account for any qualitative difference between the opposing forces.  Losses, which are recorded directly on the map by placing a Strength marker under the unit suffering casualties, may result from either Fire or Shock combat.  In general, however, Shock Combat is depicted as a &ldquo;morale showdown&rdquo; more useful for gaining ground than inflicting casualties.&#10;&#10;Morale, which Napoleon deemed to be three times as important as numerical strength on the battlefield, is accurately accounted for in the Effectiveness Rating assigned to every infantry battalion, cavalry regiment and artillery battery crew.&#10;&#10;Buyer's Guide for WELLINGTON'S VICTORY&#10;The following ratings are based on at least 100 player-replies to surveys conducted through Strategy &amp; Tactics Magazine.  Ratings are on a 1 (worst) to 9 (best) scale.  Average ratings (for over 60 historical games in print) are:  Acceptability-6.00, Complexity-5.00.&#10;&#10;Acceptability Rating:        New Game&#10;Complexity Rating:        (est.) 7.8&#10;Avg.

This is not a complete game; players are required to independantly purchase miniatures and construct a playing surface (wargames terrain). The game is scaled for 10mm miniatures (1:144, N Scale), and is designed to represent combat at the regiment and brigade level set in a fantasy/renaissance techology world.&#10;&#10;In Warmaster, combat and casualty calculations occur at the stand level. That is, for every stand in a unit, a number of dice are rolled in combat. As whole stands are removed by sustaining casualties, the number of dice similalry decreases.&#10;&#10;The command mechanism in Warmaster is simple but evocative. Each leader model has a Command factor. To issue a command, such as 'move forward' to a unit, two dice must be rolled against that target command factor. For every subsequent order attempted the target number becomes more difficult to achieve. As a consequence, despite being on the surface a move-counter move system, the turns are variable length and each player may not have the full opportunity to achieve everything they may want to. This simple mechanism introduces enjoyable tension into what is otherwise a largely conventional set of wargame rules.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Warmaster Annual 2002&#10;    Warmaster Annual 2003&#10;    Warmaster Armies&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Warmaster Ancients&#10;    The Battle of Five Armies&#10;&#10;&#10;Supported by the Warmaster magazine.&#10;&#10;"

One player (the sorcerer player) hides the wand in his realm and defends it with a group of evil sorcerers who can summon the aid of demons, orcs, and ghouls.

The board portrays the valley of the evil sorcerers, and on it the sorcerer player places the counters representing haunts (temples, ruins, and crypts), secretly recording one of them as the haunt in which the wand is hidden. The counters representing the sorcerers and their minions are then placed on the board, and on the sorcerer player's first turn they can begin summoning other evil units. The wizard player brings in the wizard units and their allies through one or more hexes along the valley border, and the struggle begins.&#10;&#10;Each side can attack with spells and by physical combat. The wizard player should usually try to strike quickly, before the sorcerer player can organize an effective resistance. Only the sorcerer player gets a steady stream of reinforcements, in the form of wandering-orc counters, but the wizard player has the advantage of special attacking bonuses. To win, the wizard player must locate the wand and remove it from the sorcerers' valley through an entry/exit hex.&#10;&#10;"
