Players gain control of the cards by correctly answering curious census questions, then test their skill and luck by determining if the next card is higher or lower than the previous card. Complete with the action-packed Money Round, play Card Sharks and win BIG!&quot;&#10;&#10;Based on the classic game show, two players compete to flip over their row of cards by correctly predicting the response to various surveys (one player gives a number, the other guesses &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot;). Whoever wins that question then plays a higher-lower game with their row; players may freeze after a correct card prediction, as a wrong guess removes and replaces all unfrozen cards; the player also loses their turn if the next card is the same as the one before it. Completing the row, or having your opponent fail to do so by the fourth &quot;Sudden Death&quot; question wins the round, and two rounds wins the match.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game plays the Money Cards, which offers up to $32,000 in winnings.

The game plays much like the original format, but the front game is shortened to a single 5-question round, with each player having to flip a row of 7 cards (10 in the first season) to win and take $10,000 to the Money Cards, which now also uses a single 7-card line and no money add-ons but can bring the player's winnings to $640,000. And like the revival, the player uses &quot;poker chips&quot; (cardboard markers with poker chip designs) to keep track of their winning s during the Money Cards round.&#10;&#10;"

In the Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable. His possible courses of action were governed by the &lsquo;technology&rsquo; of the time, the wind, weather, ship&rsquo;s condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships&rsquo; companies.&#10;&#10;Fundamental to the rules is the Ability Chart which requires only 1 throw of dice and governs the core game (except Weather) as well as other options. Note:&#10;When for example &lsquo;movement section&rsquo; is referred to in the rules, this relates to the movement section of the Ability Chart.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Taken from the 4th edition (2005), is the description for &quot;Signal Close Action&quot; by Mr. Rod Langton.&#10;&#10;&quot;This new edition of Signal Close Action is very timely, this being the year of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar.  It inspired me to produce, not just an update of previous editions, but an enhanced game, smoother, with more fluid movement and ability for vessels.&#10;&#10;Signal Close Action was designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set.  In Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable.  His possible courses of action were governed by the 'technology' of the time, the win, weather, ship's condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships' companies.&#10;&#10;For those who re very new to Napoleonic naval wargaming, you might find my Fast Play set a good introduction.  Even after you progress to a full comprehensive game, your Fast Play will still be very useful for club games and introducing others to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Experienced Signal Close Action players will want to know 'what's new' in Fourth Edition.  Well, the concept of the Ability Chart is still fundamental to the rules - particularly as it cuts down on the need for excessive record keeping.  This time however, there are more dice and they play critical roles.  In the past, if you had a 'bad [dice] throw' then ll your actions were affected.  With Fourth Edition, the dice are color coded, with one being 'common' to all.  The score of this Common dice [die] is added to the dice [die] relating to the various actions.&#10;&#10;Other new innovations include the division of a player's part of Turn into two segments and reloading, so that the time scale of actions are more realistic.  The actual Firing rules are not changed noticeably but there are new separate charts for firing at unrated vessels.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Jim Dunnigan, then aged 25 and described in the game's &quot;designer's notes&quot; as a history major in the School of General Studies, had already designed 1914 and was at the time working on Origins of World War II, but was asked to take time out to work on this design.&#10;&#10;The game is for two players, Radicals and Administration.  The map features eleven tracks for each of the political subgroups in the game (e.g. Black Students, Moderate Strikers, Alumni, Harlem Community).  The objective for the players is to have the most influence, determined by the positions of markers on these tracks, for their side by the end of the twelfth turn.  During a turn, players deploy abstracted units representing their political leverage onto the tracks to 'attack' the other player's units (as tokens, Dunnigan suggests small pieces of paper colored red or marijuana seeds for the Radicals, and blue bits of paper or capsules of Seconal for the Administration) and so move the markers towards their 'end' of the tracks.  The 24 Contingency Cards add some randomness by taking or giving units of wherewithal to one player or another.&#10;&#10;SPI sold photocopies of this game supplement for a couple of years after its start.

12248,,"A description by Phalanx's Uli Blennemann from &quot;Gone Cardboard&quot;&#10;&#10;It is a completely new game, much lighter in complexity. The game uses a large gameboard, comes in our big box and is for 2-5 players. Playing time is 75+ minutes. It is not a simulation game but provides more Alex flavor than Alexandros. Each turn, players move with their armies (wooden) and build cities and temples (both wooden, too).&#10;&#10;In this game, players follow the path of Alexander's army, occupying provinces in regions, building temples, founding cities. You score points each round and also at the end of the game for majorities. There are 5 regions, but for the short game you just use #2 to #4.&#10;&#10;Players have 15 tiny wood cubes which they distribute each round on a hidden plan in 4 ways. Then they reveal their choices and carry out the actions. This way they decide 1. turn order 2. army size 3. temple building 4. city building. By putting more cubes than others in the sections controls how the round works for you.&#10;&#10;So the player with the most cubes in 1. gets to choose their turn order (since going later may be better). Then the cubes in 2. become your army on the board (and having majorities in provinces scores 2 pts). Moving the armies around costs cubes as well, which are taken from 3. and 4. Then, where your soldiers are, you can build temples (3.) or found cities (4.). But if another player is also doing the same, whoever has the most cubes on their plan gets it, but pays 1 more than the second highest.&#10;&#10;In this way, players spend their 15 cubes each round, moving from province to province in the region, trying to score points for controlling armies, building temples and cities. Where players directly compete, the costs are high. Where you are unopposed, your unspent cubes carry on to the next round, allowing you to try to get more points.&#10;&#10;When the last region is conquered, there is a final scoring, for the majorities of temples and cities in each region and then in the whole game. The scoring switches here, since in the rounds temples earn you 3pts &amp; cities earn 5pts. But at game end, cities earn 10pts and temples earn 15pts.&#10;&#10;The game is a mix of planning, bluff, tactics and group think. It works as a contest of majorities and the use of the cubes, in both deciding who goes and what things cost, is clever.&#10;&#10;"

It is 1942, Japan is at the height of her expansion into Southeast Asia and the Pacific, yet China stands defiantly unconquerable. As the Japanese player, you must carefully pit the Chinese factions against each other while using your superior military machine to bring all of China under your control. As the Nationalist Chinese player, you must cooperate with the Communists (however distasteful that may seem) to drive the invading Japanese from the shores of China before re-establishing your authority as the only central government of China. As the Chinese Communist player, you too are faced with an enemy worse than fellow Chinese. You must first drive the Japanese from China before you can put your superior guerrilla tactics to work against the corrupt Kuomintang.&#10;&#10;Player&rsquo;s Value: This is a simple game with undemanding rules (movement two areas per turn, roll dice in simultaneous rounds of combat, each &ldquo;1&rdquo; is an elimination and each &ldquo;6&rdquo; is a retreat, minor variations on this for leaders, air forces, etc.). It hustles right along at six months per turn, with a variable exit point for the Japanese. The game is unusual in that it is designed primarily for three players, any one of which has a good shot at winning the game (if the Japanese player wins, the two Chinese players can play a Civil War endgame to see who comes in second).&#10;&#10;"

(See: Ogre.)&#10;&#10;In this game, the opposing forces are faced off against IT, a sort of mega-tank or robot. The conventional forces must defend a planetary base from IT. The player controlling IT creates a customized war-machine design by allocating IT's 1000 mass/weight units. The variable characteristics include IT's speed, armor, weaponry, defensive systems, and (structural?) integrity.&#10;&#10;Each game turn consists of the first player moving any or all his units, followed by that player's combat phase. The second player then executes his own movement and combat phases, completing the turn. Terrain affects movement and combat, with line of sight being a factor.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard IT versus conventional forces scenario, three additional scenarios are provided: a two-player conventional forces battle, a two-player IT versus IT battle, and a three-player battle royale where two of the players control an IT and the third player controls the conventional forces. Rules are also provided for a solitaire game in which the player controls IT against 20 random conventional force units that move and attack as determined by the game system.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules variations allow for plotted simultaneous movement and/or combat. Additional optional rules provide for opportunity fire and a two-player &quot;Blind IT&quot; game. The blind game uses two mapsheets so that the IT player can only see units visible to IT.

Properties such as Beauty Parlor, Department Store, etc., are bought and sold at prices that rise and fall quite unexpectedly depending on whether the conditions are NORMAL, BOOM times, or BUST (depression times). The game is quick moving and amusing. The game ends when all but one player becomes bankrupt and this surviving player WINS THE GAME. If the players prefer, a time limit may be set at the end of which time the player owning the greatest amount of property and cash (when added together) WINS THE GAME.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Board has 16 properties (4/side) with purchase price and rent printed on the inside of each space. The Board has NORMAL prices printed thereon. A removable panel, which fits over two pegs in the center of the board, has BOOM prices and rents on the obverse and BUST prices and rents on the reverse. The game starts in NORMAL cycle, changes to BOOM cycle, then to BUST cycle, then back to NORMAL, etc., when any player lands on any of the three corner spaces marked with a Star. (The fourth corner is &quot;Start Here.&quot;) Players try to increase their worth by buying properties at BUST or NORMAL prices, and selling properties at BOOM prices, while trying to bankrupt their opponents by collecting rents, the highest of which is $250,000. The standard rule concerning landing on Un-owned Property is &quot;buy it or leave it.&quot; There is an AUCTION option in the Rules, similar to the Auction Rule in Monopoly.&#10;This game plays like a simplified version of its more famous stable mate, Monopoly, but with the unique twist that all properties' values increase or decrease at the same time, sometimes in rapid succession, without having to develop the properties or have groups or sets.&#10;&#10;The raised playing field (Board) actually sits in the 15&quot;x15&quot;x2&quot; box bottom (it is not designed to stand alone). It has a slot on the outside of each property space, wherein the owner places his/her like-colored &quot;T-card&quot; vertically to show ownership. The bills, which are the size of older Monopoly games, come in denominations of $100, $1000, and $10,000. There are also blue/white discs worth $5,000 and silver/blue discs worth $50,000. Four painted wooden markers (red, blue, green, yellow) and two white dice complete the equipment. The Rules sheet states &quot;Questions on the rules for BOOM OR BUST will be answered gladly if 3-cent stamp is enclosed.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

One is the pair of unsuited trumps, which rank below the top four cards of the trump suit.  The other is that the five suits are grouped into a pair and a triplet, and the suits in each set can be played for each other at times (the rules are a bit confusing here).&#10;&#10;Scoring is reminiscent of bridge, with points earned above and below the line.&#10;&#10;While the main game is for exactly four players, a solitaire game is included.&#10;&#10;Probably the main point of interest is the game's 1930s Socialist flavor.  The good suits are Scientists, Idealists, and Judges, with the bad ones Bankers and Advertisers.  The cards are individually named, some for people and some for methods and tools (&quot;Radio,&quot; &quot;Logic,&quot; etc.).  The unsuited trumps are Honesty and Kindness.&#10;&#10;Also of interest are the card illustrations.  Some were done by the designer, but the others by well-known American artists of the period - Rockwell Kent, Peggy Bacon, William Gropper, and George Schreiber (other cards were by Esther Vance, who appears to not have attracted much attention in the art world).
