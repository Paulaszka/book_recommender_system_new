Like its award-winning predecessors Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen, the game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic tactical card battles, with the armies in this set having more heavy defense and the series&rsquo; first moving units.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Templar faction is based around a heavily armoured infantry and mobile palisades. The Undead army contains a stark range of defensive and offensive units, including zombies which roam across the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Templars versus Undead is compatible with both Elves versus Lizardmen and Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;"

Any missing units of work (are required by the Attraction) cause Tourists to leave before gathering resources.&#10;     Players gain the primary resource of Gold by having more tourists at each attraction, and Flair by having less tourists. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase II - Action: Attract, Hire &amp; UpgradeIn order, players take one action per turn or pass. Players will be interacting with common draft areas, as well as using abilities from their own workers and attractions. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;     Attract Tourists from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Tourists are placed at attractions, potentially increasing the Gold gained on the subsequent turn.&#10;     Attract a Hero from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Heroes start with low health, which is gained at the end of each round. Fully Rested Heroes are scored for Victory Points.&#10;     Upgrade an Attraction (Spending Gold) - Providing higher tourist capacity, better Gold payout, better abilities and more Victory Points. Upgraded attractions typically require more workers to keep them fully staffed.&#10;     Train or Hire new Workers (Spending Gold) - Upgrade your workers to provide more work, or better abilities. Training locks a worker draft pile, preventing other players from upgrading to that particular worker during the round. Training workers is a 1-for-1 exchange, keeping players' Worker Deck lean by design. &#10;     Pass - The first Player to Pass becomes the Start Player for the next round&#10;&#10;&#10;Any time during a player's turn, he may use abilities from fully-staffed attractions, or discard worker cards to use their unique abilities.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase III - A Ship ArrivesThe dock is refilled with new Heroes and Tourists from a center pile. While refilling, it's possible to trigger a Monster Attack!&#10;&#10;     If an Attack! card is revealed, the top Monster from the Monster Pile will choose which player it's attacking; typically by Most Tourists or Most Heroes at their resort, ties broken clockwise from the start player.&#10;     If a Hero defends against a Monster Attack, he loses 1 health. Any undefended damage causes tourists to be eaten by the Monster.&#10;     Heroes may dodge into, or out of, a Monster Attack up to one time per round.&#10;     If an attraction has no Hero or Tourists, a Monster will Damage it, potentially destroying the attraction.&#10;     A player may chose (if they have one) to throw a Lazy Peon at the monster, ending the attack and permenantly removing the Worker Card from the game.&#10;     The Dock Continues to refill, potentially triggering more Monster Attacks, until it is full.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase IV - Clean Up&#10;     Used and unused Workers are placed in players' discard piles.&#10;     Any fully-rested Heroes are scored - Placed to the side, each worth Victory Points at the end of the game. This Hero also removes the top Monster from the remaining Monster Deck.&#10;     Remaining Heroes gain 1 Health each.&#10;     Any Locked Worker Draft Piles and Attraction Abilities are made available for the next round.&#10;     Any unused Flair is sent back to the supply. Gold carries over to the next round.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues with Phase I&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game EndIf at the end of the round  there are no Monsters remaining, the game is over and players total Victory Points from Attractions, Scored Heroes, and 1 point for each remaining Hero at their resort. The player with the highest Victory Point total has built the most Epic Resort and is victorious!&#10;&#10;"

This deck developed from Tensh&#197;&#141; karuta, itself a close copy of the 48-card traditional Portuguese cards called &quot;dragon cards&quot; due to the dragons holding the suit symbols in the aces. Its creation was prompted by a ban on the older form of playing cards after Japan closed off the contact with the Western world in 1633, and became critical towards everything of European origin. Sunkun karuta took this game one step further.&#10;&#10;The deck contains all 48 cards from Tensh&#197;&#141; karuta; these are supplemented by introducing a fifth suit and increasing the number of cards in each suit from twelve to fifteen. Most additions refer to Japanese and Chinese culture, presumably a conscious choice intended to downplay the European origins of the game.&#10;&#10;The suits are &#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#134; (hau), &quot;flower&quot; based on Portuguese 'paus' meaning &quot;clubs&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153; (isu) a shortened form of 'espadas' or &quot;swords&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#183; (koppu) from 'copas' or  &quot;cups&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#139; (&#197;&#141;ru) from 'ouros' or &quot;coins&quot; (literally &quot;golds&quot;) and finally the added &#227;&#129;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#139; (guru) with the traditional Japanese &#228;&#184;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#183;&#180; (mitsudomoe) sign as suit symbol. As in the European predecessor games, higher-numbered pip cards beat lower ones only in the former two suits, while the latter ones are &quot;reversed&quot;.&#10;&#10;The &quot;dragon aces&quot; are split into two distinct ranks by reintroducing a normal &quot;one&quot; in each suit and separate from the &#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#132; (robai) or &quot;dragon&quot; which normally ranks right above the ones. Above the number cards (1&ndash;9 plus robai) there are five court cards. From low to high, these are: &#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#159; (s&#197;&#141;ta) &quot;queen&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190; (uma) &quot;horse&quot;, &#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#138; (kiri) &quot;soldier&quot; (originally a king), &#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#147; (un) various Japanese mythological figures and &#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#147; (sun) various Chinese officials. The latter two ranks give the game its name. In the trump suit, the robai is promoted to above the kiri and the s&#197;&#141;ta above this again, except that the robai of hau is a permanent trump which is the fourth highest regardless of which suit is trump.&#10;&#10;"

It is played on the spaces (squares) of a 10x10 checkered square board, which is initially empty. Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.&#10;&#10;Both players control a number of neutral red pieces and shoot stones of their own colour from them. In order to win, a player must claim a majority of neutral pieces by having them surrounded by larger groups of their own pieces than their opponent's.&#10;&#10;This game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it. Stones on top of shooters are not part of any groups.&#10;&#10;A trapped shooter is a shooter that cannot make any legal move in the current position.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayThe first player begins by placing three shooters and one black stone on empty squares of the board. The second player then chooses which player will be Black and which will be White. Next, White places the remaining four shooters and one white stone on empty squares of the board. In both cases, no shooters can be placed on the perimeter of the board. This restriction does not apply to the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;From then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On your turn, you may (but are not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any stones. Then, you must place a stone of your color on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the shooter was moved (or from any shooter, if none was moved), with no stones in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) cannot move or shoot. Note shooters can move and shoot over claimed or unclaimed shooters.&#10;&#10;After shooting, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that have not been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Smaller versionsFor shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:&#10;&#10;&#10;     7x7 board with three shooters. The first player places one shooter, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     9x9 board with five shooters. The first player places two shooters, and White places the other three.

Each battle is different according to the terrain dice thrown, which determine how many and which dice may battle, if any are modified/doubled, and how many actions each player may take per turn.  Each type of die has basic abilities (resurrection/banishment, mimicry, split attacks, join-forces, re-roll opponent die/dice, re-roll own die/dice), and all but the d4 have special abilities activated by rolling pairs (or more) of the same number.&#10;&#10;The player with initiative (usually lower total roll) takes one, two, or three actions (based on the throw of the terrain dice) before the opponent has a chance to respond. Actions include one die attacking another or activating abilities, or activating abilities and then attacking an opponent's die (most common).&#10;&#10;There is a balance between thinking through the possibilities and over-thinking what your opponent may do, particularly in the selection of which dice to roll at the beginning of each battle.
