Your opponent places your six pieces on the board in any configuration they want. Each piece is placed on a white dot. Your task is to reunite your pieces into one stack. The first one to do so wins. Players start out with six numbered pieces; one (1), two (2), and three (3). The numbers on the pieces indicate the number of spaces (dots) a piece can travel. Pieces can pass over their own or their opponent&rsquo;s pieces, but cannot land on a dot occupied by an opponent, only their own. When a player lands on their own piece it is combined into a stack with the top piece number representing the number of moves that stack can travel. Players can have multiple stacks that they create as they are striving for their single stack.

The ever-benevolent Jade Emperor wanted to help mankind out. From there, the idea of a twelve-year cycle and the naming of each year in the cycle after an animal was born.&#10;&#10;But how should the Jade Emperor choose twelve animals from among so many in the living world, while remaining impartial? To resolve this equitably, the Jade Emperor decided to hold a race involving all animals on his birthday. The first twelve animals to cross the river and reach the Heavenly Palace will have a year named after them, in the order of how they finished the race. The race became known as The Great Race and the twelve-year cycle was named the Chinese Zodiac.&#10;&#10;Race for the Chinese Zodiac is a board game that recreates The Great Race. Each player has a hand of eight action cards (numbered 1-8) as well as energy cards of different values and karma tokens. Each player selects one animal token and takes the corresponding animal card, which grants the player advantages during the race. All players place their animal token on the start space of the racetrack. Players assemble the dual-layered and double-sided action wheel that's used to determine the effectiveness of each action and place it in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, all players select an action card and an energy card from their hand, then they reveal these cards simultaneously. If the action card selected is one value lower than the player's previously played action card, the player must spend one karma token; if two or more values lower, they must spend two karma tokens. Players then resolve all played actions based on the orientation of the wheel, ideally gaining movement, new energy cards, and karma. Everyone places their played cards face up in front of themselves, then rotate the wheel clockwise by one space and start a new turn.&#10;&#10;The first animal to complete the race earns the coveted right of having the first year of the Chinese Zodiac named after it!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Figures vary in cost between 6 AP and 2 AP. One figure of the most expensive mounted type or most expensive foot type present is nominated as the force's commander and one figure of each group is nominated as its leader.&#10;&#10;Current skirmish rules split play into very small increments and use simultaneous movement requiring written orders. We split play into alternate bounds, each of which simulates the time needed by a warrior to observe, appreciate his situation, decide if he needs to continue a current action or to do something different and then do it, or to exchange blows with or shoot at an opponent. This is about 5 seconds.&#10;&#10;As all men are not similarly quick thinking or quick to react, we randomly limit the number of figures that can shoot or be moved each bound, but not the exchange of blows by figures already in physical contact. Since complex group actions require orders that cannot be passed and obeyed in 5 seconds, they are made more difficult to achieve and are assumed to have been initiated during the previous bounds.&#10;&#10;We distinguish between fatal and disabling wounds, but do not take account of wounds unlikely to affect combat in the short term, or distinguish the fates of men from those of their mounts. The winning side recovers its disabled. Those of the losers are assumed to be slain in the pursuit, except for knights who are ransomed.&#10;&#10;Despite its simplicity, the resulting system is much more subtle than may be immediately apparent.

Survival can come at a high cost, even it means disposing of your fellow rats so that you can be the last rat standing, or crawling.&#10;&#10;Contents: 20&rdquo; x 20&rdquo; neoprene board / 6 rat pieces / 120 plumbing tiles / 64 two sided trap pieces / 2 eight sided dies&#10;&#10;Number of players: 2 &ndash; 6 rats can play this deadly game individually, or teams of 2 players or 3 players can be formed.&#10;&#10;Objective: To be the last rat left on the board. When a rat is unable to move on its turn it is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Setup: All the players work together placing the plumbing tiles onto the board until all 64 white squares are filled up. After all the pipe tiles have been placed on the board players place their rat piece anywhere on the board that has a white dot in the plumbing. Players take turns going clockwise.&#10;&#10;Plumbing Tiles: There are a total of 120 plumbing tiles. Only 64 of the 120 tiles are needed to fill in all the white squares. The tiles can be rotated to fit other pipes.&#10;&#10;Players select and place the tiles on the board in any arrangement they want, but all the pipe ends must be connected to another pipe end except for the 16 pipes that end in a circle. There are 32 toilets that must be connected to a pipe. Players take turns placing one tile at a time until all 64 spaces are filled. It is possible not to have piping in every space and 3 blank tiles without pipes are provided to fill in those squares. If the pipes don&rsquo;t fit at the end players can rearrange them as a group to make them fit.&#10;&#10;Toilets: Printed on the board are 32 toilets outside of the white squares. Each toilet has a number in it and these numbers are used to reference the placement of traps when the dice are rolled. A player can travel from one end of the board to the other through toilets. Traveling can only take place if there is not another rat or a trap next to the toilet. Traveling is always at the exact opposite end of the board on the same row from which a rat enters a toilet. Traps cannot be moved through a toilet.&#10;&#10;Black Traps: Everytime the dice are rolled traps are placed on the board. Rats can never move onto or go across a trap. The two dice are rolled on each rat&rsquo;s turn. The two numbers on the dice determine the placement of the traps. There is a green die and a yellow die that correspond with the green and yellow toilets. So if you were to roll a yellow 5 and a green 2 then you would go to the yellow 5 toilet and move across until you line up with the green 2 toilet. Where those two numbers meet is where you would place a black trap. Then you would flip the numbers, yellow 2 and green 5 to place the second black trap. If a rat rolls double then only a red trap is laid. If a trap lands on a rat then the rat moves to another location. The rat can only move in a straight line from where it is being displaced. Black traps can be moved by any rat on their turn. Black traps can only be moved one space at a time in one turn.&#10;&#10;Red Traps: Red traps are created when any two black traps are combined. This combining can be done when a black trap is placed on top of another black trap from the roll of the dice or when a rat moves one black trap onto another. Red traps can never be moved. They are permanent. No black traps can be put on top of a red trap. Like the black trap rats can never land on or go over a red trap.&#10;&#10;Moving: Rats can travel more than one space at a time in a turn as long as it is in a straight line and not blocked by a trap. They can make a turn on their next turn. They can squeeze past another rat on their path, but cannot land in the same space of another rat. Rats can never land on or cross over a trap. Rats can hop in a toilet and travel to the other end (row), but only if it is not occupied by another rat or trap. They can only pop in on the first square at the opposite end. A rat must be able to move in their turn, or they are eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;Moving Traps: A rat can choose to move a trap in place of moving plumbling tiles. There are different reasons why a rat may do this. One reason would be to clear a path for it to travel, another would be to try to trap another rat. If a rat moves a black trap onto another black trap it becomes a red trap which is permanent and cannot be moved. Black traps cannot be moved onto red traps. Black traps can only be moved one space at a time and a rat can move any black trap on the board. Traps cannot be moved through the toilets.&#10;&#10;Moving Plumbing Tiles: A rat can choose to move 4 plumbing tiles in place of moving a trap on their turn. Only 4 plumbing tiles can be switched out, but only if there is not a rat or trap on the tile that is being switched out. The ends of the pipes on the tile being switched out must match any open end.&#10;&#10;Rolling Traps on Top of Traps: If a trap is rolled on top of an existing black trap then it is turned into a red trap. If a trap is rolled on top of an existing red trap then the one who rolled the dice can place that black trap anywhere on the board except on an existing red trap, or rat. When ever a double is rolled on a clear space it is automatically a red trap and there is only one trap for that roll. If a double is rolled on top of a black trap it becomes a red trap with an extra black trap to be placed by the one who rolled the dice anywhere on the board except an existing red trap, or on a rat. If a double is rolled on top of a red trap then the one who rolled the dice can choose to place one red trap anywhere on the board or two black traps anywhere on the board.&#10;&#10;Death of a Rat: When a rat is unable to move it is removed from the board. If after the end of your turn you are unable to move you are removed from the game. All the players pay silent homage to the departed rat and then continue the game.&#10;&#10;End of Game: The game ends when there is only one rat left to move.&#10;&#10;"

These actions can be spread across the entire team, or used by only one character, depending on a character&rsquo;s traits.&#10;&#10;When a character is killed, the player who killed that character earns the number of victory points printed on the character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card, and the player whose character was killed draws a &ldquo;zero&rdquo; card from the &ldquo;zeroes&rdquo; pile for every victory point listed on the killed character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card and adds it to their discard pile. The killed character respawns in their base immediately, but that character cannot move or attack on their next turn, and effectively loses a turn while respawning.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach ten victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Eventually a crushing French victory, starting in the fog by Lannes engaging a single Prussian division under Tauentzien, it escalated into a full battle against Hohenlohe and half of the Prussian army, at first not fully grasping what he was facing, engaging his army piece-meal. While starting outnumbered, the French are at the top of their military value and the masterful&nbsp;concentration of the army during the day makes J&eacute;na&nbsp;the epitome of victories.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Auerstaedt, was fought on the same day, opposing Davout and his Third corps to the main Prussian army under Brunswick and the King of Prussia. An unexpected battle, as more troops enter the battlefield on both sides, a masterpiece where Davout earned his title of Duke of Auerstaedt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of that day, the two Prussian armies, both beaten in this double battle, join in a common rout, followed by a legendary pursuit lead by Murat to the destruction of the arrogant Prussian army in a few weeks. &nbsp;&#10; Both battles comes with many what-ifs and a total of 15 scenarios, using troops from both armies not historically engaged.

A lot happens on both maps, sorties, relief Russian forces under Kamenski, the Danzig morale that conditions victory goes up and down depending on the progress of the siege works and other events.

Players compete against each other to be the first to collect 5 pairs of gems using action and upgrade cards that follow a mining theme. Action cards include pickaxes to take cards, torch lamps to see another player's hand, and more. Upgrade cards create status effects, such as Land Deed which increases the player's hand to 8 cards until discarded by the required action card. With 6 cards per hand, each turn players place down pairs to declare gems, use action or upgrade cards, and then draw to fill their hand.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The BGG database does not allow a player count of 0. Zero-player games are also known as autonomous simulation.&#10;&#10;So, you've been eaten.&#10;&#10;Don't worry, this is simply an occupational hazard. In fact, it is fairly common among Deep Space Miners (5th class), and some say that it is almost unavoidable. And, well, it is. Especially since the crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten.&#10;&#10;But, no reason to panic. We are here to help you deal with the physical and mental challenges of being eaten. This handy simulation/survival guide is standard issue for all recruits and will eventually lead to a productive, if not potentially brief, career in space mining.&#10;&#10;Should you achieve your objective and mine enough crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jet pack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the beast. While the beast&rsquo;s immune response was not enough to prevent its demise, its contribution to human progress and corporate profitability are most definitely appreciated.&#10;&#10;In the eventuality that the bacteria present in the beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not worry. Your non-organic parts will ultimately provide much utility to future space miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of attempts by evidently less-than-qualified recruits.&#10;&#10;Finally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary crystals by the time you reach the end of the beast's digestive tract. In this case, the so-called &quot;ending #2&quot;, you will then exit the beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive, and yet forever changed. In this case, and after a thorough decontamination and quarantine period, we will have to evaluate your performance versus that of the beast&rsquo;s efforts to consume you.&#10;&#10;In So, You've Been Eaten. the Miner and the Beast face off against one another. The Miner earns points by collecting crystals, and the Beast earns points by developing immune responses and by its bacteria attacking the Miner.&#10;&#10;The Miner wins instantly by collecting all eight different crystals, and the Beast wins instantly by digesting the Miner after the attack of four bacteria of the same type. Of course, there's always the possibility that the Miner will simply pass through the Beast's system, in which case the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;So, You've Been Eaten. can be played as:&#10;&#10;        A game for 2 players, with a Miner player against a Beast player.&#10;        A game for 1 player, with the Miner player against a sleeping Beast.&#10;        A game for 1 player, with the Beast player against a robot Miner.&#10;        A game for 0 players, with a sleeping Beast against a robot Miner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

This is the second game in the series and a print and play game for solitaire and two-players. This is a standalone game in my series of WW2 print and play games. You don't need to have played the first game - everything is included (you simply need to print it all out and need a regular six sided dice and a pencil).&#10;&#10;The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and requires very little space.&#10;&#10;A print and play WW2 wargame for two players and solitaire that takes around half an hour to setup and play.&#10;&#10;The game sets a small squad of US Airborne against their German enemies in a series of small skirmish scenarios. The game's counters (or chits) each represent an actual soldier with the gameplay being in the thick of man-to-man combat.&#10;&#10;The game can be played 2-player with one player playing as the US Airborne and the other player playing as the Germans. The game can also be played Solitaire with the player playing as the US Airborne against the German AI. For gamers familiar with Solitaire wargames this game uses a random chit-pull mechanic (as detailed in the video).&#10;&#10;The game is played in a number of Turns. In each Turn the player(s) randomly picks a Pull Chit from the mug and activate their Infantry. The Game Turn ends when all the Pull Chits have been removed from the cup.&#10;&#10;The player whose Pull Chit this force belongs to can now Activate one Infantry Counter. In activating the Infantry Counter the player can choose from several Actions such as Firing against the enemy, moving, charging into close combat, applying first aid, or attempting to fix a jammed weapon.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple and effective without needing buckets of dice. Players must establish range, line of sight and any modifiers. &#10;Close combat is particularly brutal and decisive with the playing be able to declare charges into combat.&#10;Snap Fire is a defensive fire mechanic where your Infantry Counters can fire on moving enemy counters.&#10;&#10;Finally, the game features a unique mechanic in the shape of Bravery Points. These can be used to force the enemy to re-roll a dice against one of your Infantry Counters, but should you loose you will have less Bravery Points for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Solitaire Game&#10;The Solitaire takes the key gameplay from the two player game such as Combat Resolution and Movement etc and layers in specific Solitaire rules, AI for the opposing German forces and special Solitaire scenarios.&#10;&#10;The Solitaire game features a full and simple AI to handle the opposing force, that will take you step-by-step to which order the enemy counters should be activated and their actions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
