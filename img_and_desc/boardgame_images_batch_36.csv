Instead of properties, players collect &quot;preserves&quot; to save animals.  Instead of houses and hotels, players buy environmental programs like a hunting ban or pollution control.  Chance and Community Chest cards are replaced by a single &quot;action card&quot; deck.  The mechanics of the games are the same, however: roll and move, if you land on someone else's preserve, pay them money.  If they have one or more programs on that preserve, pay them even more.  One difference is how the game ends: it can end either like Monopoly (last player left after everyone else goes bankrupt wins) or a player can collect five of the species for a particular geographical area (color) in which case they win.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;ENDANGERED SPECIES is a game the entire family will enjoy.  It introduces players to the largest animal that ever lived, the fastest four-legged animal in the world, a huge bird of prey with a ten-foot wingspan, the most powerful ape, the fiercest carnivore in the Americas, and many other fascinating creatures now facing extinction.  Player try to &ldquo;save&rdquo; these animals by setting up &ldquo;Preserves&rdquo; to protect their natural habitats, and then establishing programs to protect them from hunting, capture for zoos, chemical pollution, and commercial exploitation.  To win, a player must save five species from one geographic area.  Unexpected gains and setbacks make the game unpredictable, and &ldquo;action cards&rdquo; held by each player permit a wide variety of strategic moves and counter moves.  No two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;"

The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major antagonists.  Units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, artillery, fighters and bombers. Naval action is included but abstracted. &#10;Rules are introduced at three levels: the basic game, the advanced game, and a tournament game, as well as optional rules players can include as they choose. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.&#10;&#10;&#10;The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hex and counter games, so once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game is not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics.  Once you learned one game all of the others played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.&#10;&#10;The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had ratings printed in large print on the piece, (&quot;chits&quot; or counters as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, higher odds will favor that side.&#10;&#10;Also in combat, terrain affects combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).&#10;&#10;When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.&#10;&#10;In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seemed to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.&#10;&#10;"

Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.&#10;&#10;European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.&#10;&#10;The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player.

What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian&rsquo;s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course&mdash;one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD&rsquo;40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war&mdash;from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945. (Note: Just so that no one continues any misconceptions...the Grossdeutschland was a German Army unit; it was not in the Waffen SS.)&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters&#10;Units: Infantry platoons, individual vehicles&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color maps&#10;Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 28-page TCS version 3.0 system rulebook&#10;One 8-page Grossdeutschland, 1940 specific rulebook&#10;Two 6-page TCS version 3.0 Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Four Player Aid cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: High&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 6-20 hours&#10;&#10;"

The German objective is to blast the American lines and exit as many units as possible on the West and North West edges of the map.&#10;&#10;Central to the system are the supply rules. Supply lines are interdicted by possession and proximity (3 hex range) to bridge hex-sides. Victory is checked at the end of every turn where the Germans will compare VPs collected against the Victory conditions. If Victory conditions are not met, play continues.&#10;&#10;"

Four colored suitcases are placed in the center of the table, with the badger next to one of them.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the player rolls the die. If the die shows a color, the player places one of his items in the suitcase of this color; if the badger sits next to this suitcase, he places two items instead. If, however, the die shows a badger, the player must open the suitcase and reclaim all of the items packed inside &ndash; even if they weren't his to begin with! He then moves the badger to the next suitcase in the circle. One bonus to this punishment: If a player ever has a complete set of garments, he returns one of each item to the game box, removing them from the game.&#10;&#10;The first player to pack all of his garments wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
