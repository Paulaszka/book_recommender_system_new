Each card is worth 0-2 rolls of toilet paper as depicted on those cards. Additionally, you score points equal to the number of which you have the most tiles, e.g. if you have four 8s and three or fewer of each other number, you score a bonus of 8 points. In case of a tie for most tiles, you score the lower value.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most rolls wins!&#10;&#10;"

The government sees them as a major threat and has engaged the secret service. As Secret Service agents conduct house searches, patrol and guard the border, Christians try to smuggle Bibles and do their best to spread the gospel. Who can you trust?&#10;&#10;The game if playable for groups of 2-20 players. It is suitable for large groups of 10 to 20 players as a group game and for 2-9 players in the form of a card game! Including an accessible conversation starter from Open Doors about prosecution.&#10;&#10;CARDGAME 2-9 players&#10;In the card game for 2-9 players, every player receives a (hidden) role card that decides whether he's in team &quot;believers&quot; or &quot;secret agents&quot;. Players also get 3-5 character cards, depending on the amount of players. There are &quot;believers&quot; and &quot;secret agents&quot; among those cards, these are the cards people will try to collect. Most of the other cards are action cards that may help people achieve their goals, like viewing another players role card, forcing other players to discard, grab a specific card from the discard pile or even change your role card with another player to switch teams.&#10;&#10;Players will need to make sure that all of the cards in their hand fit their role card to win. When a player only has character cards fitting its role, he wins for the amount of card +2 bonus points. Teammates will be awarded the amount of cards MINUS the character cards fitting their role, making it a valid strategy as well not to collect those cards and actively trying to help their teammates. Players can also collect as many cards from the other team and try to switch to that team. All in all, a rather quick and dynamic card game for 2-9 players.&#10;&#10;GROUP GAME 10-20 players&#10;When playing with 10-20 players, it is a role playing game. There's a game leader who hands every player a character card and. The group is basically divided in two (equally strong) teams of believers and secret agents. The game is played in 7 &quot;nights&quot; where every player will close their eyes until they want to perform an action. All players can only choose one action to perform. In general the believers can choose one of two options: either smuggle bibles or try to convert agents. The secret agents can try to stop both. The game leader registers the amount of players for each action. Believers are successful if they gain a majority over the secret agents &quot;defending&quot; and option. Converting secret agents can be a strong strategy because not only it may &quot;create&quot; a new believer, but also reduces the amount of secret agents. However, it is not without dangers: if the secret agents have a majority guarding against that action, it may result in a believer being arrested.&#10;&#10;Some of the believers and secret agents have special abilities that may help their teams successfully achieve their goals. Like a detective (secret agent) who can try to arrest believers and a lawyer (believer) who can exonerate them or characters that can gather and communicate extra information. Other special characters make the game even more dynamic, like a &quot;traitor&quot; (starting as a believer but automatically switching to the secret agents after 3 rounds are played) and its &quot;researcher&quot; mirror character (starting as secret agent and becoming a believer after 3 rounds).&#10;&#10;Believers win if they successfully smuggle bibles 4 out of 7 rounds or if they convert all secret agents. Secret agents win if they prevent the smuggling of bibles 4 times or if they arrest all believers. &#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Construction projects in your city are disrupting the natural butterfly habitat. Capture  butterflies and deliver them to protected butterfly gardens in local zoos, botanical gardens, and museums.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar. When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the different butterfly gardens to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.&#10;&#10;In this second edition, the artwork and components have been upgraded. A major rule change is a new set-collection aspect of the delivery cards. There are now 4 types of delivery cards and players score a bonus for having a variety. Also, there are some minor rule changes with scoring butterflies in one's hand and jar at game end. Another small change is in the special powers on some of the cards.&#10;  &#10;The maximum number of players in the second edition was lowered to 5 from 6.&#10;&#10;"

A central deck is formed from the rest of the cards. It is played in turn. The player plays one card, calls the total value of all played cards and draws one card. If the sum of the played cards is exactly 21, that player wins all played cards to a face-down pile. A player cannot play a card if the total value would exceed 21. If a player cannot play a card, the previous player wins the played cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck is empty and all hand cards have been played. The player with the most collected cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Finally she came, blossomed by a tear of light, which gave rise to all living beings, now she has been imprisoned by her power-hungry children and you will have to free her. ETEREA princess has been chained to the heart of the first world, her children, custodians of the six dimensions , they overturned the throne determined to master the fundamental principles to be able to reign over the entire universe. What was once a thriving planet is now a distant memory, that place where life was born has died out, the Vital Essences, now lost, they no longer generate beings and the thread that binds all the galaxies is corroded and close to splitting. The last hope is a handful of Architects, faithful heralds of the princess, designers of all perceptible dimensions and im palpable. Only they will have the ardor to undertake a mission to the limit of the impossible to try to subjugate the six tyrants, take their keys and free ETEREA from an unacceptable fate; if they fail, everything will be lost, the universe, as we know it, will cease to exist giving way to despair, chaos, ruin.&#10;&#10;In ETEREA you are one of the architects who will attempt the enterprise to recover the keys, guarded by the six Bosses who govern the six dimensions: Water, Fire, Wind, Earth, Cosmos and Oblivion, to free the princess and save the whole ETEREA is a game divided into two parts: in the first you will have to wander through the six dimensions trying to reconstruct the Requirements, now swept away by the tyrants, to repopulate them; doing this will allow you to acquire Requirement cards and Artifacts, which are essential to succeed in the mission; to create the Requirements you will need careful planning in the dice roll and a careful use of certain skills or Vocations. In the second part you will have to face the Bosses and recover the keys, in doing so you will have to build your dice set , thanks to what I learned in the first part, and launch yourself in a desperate attempt to defeat them in an unequal duel, but thanks to a careful strategy, nothing will be impossible. There is more, always keep an eye on the time that passes , you will only have eighteen hours, a single day on ETEREA, then everything will be lost. Only an Architect will be able to succeed in the heroic action, but everyone will be able to perish in battle leading everything known to ruin. Good luck, that the glow of ETEREA accompany you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
