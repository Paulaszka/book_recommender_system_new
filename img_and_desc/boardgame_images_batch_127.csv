14497,,"STARLORD was an independently published Science-Fiction Strategic level, Empire-Building board-wargame. The game came in a large manila envelope. It came with 4 large blue-print card stock star maps, a small rule book, and four sets of tables and record sheets in plastic covers to allow writing with grease pencils. Each set had a star system record sheet, a distance chart, a ships log, and a Ship Statistics Table. Players had to provide a die and grease pencils.&#10;&#10;The die was only used to determine the number of planets at each star explored. There were no other random elements in the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players would write movement orders for their ships. Then if players encountered each other at a Star, combat could be resolved. Finally minerals would be collected at each controlled planet and loaded on transports for shipping to industrial planets for construction of ships.&#10;Each player kept all their activities secret on their record sheets, and the dice-less system of resolving combat allowed the players to know how many ships the opponent had in a combat, but not what type.&#10;&#10;The game worked best when there was a referee processing the players' input, and thus was very amenable to play by mail. However it could also be played without a referee.&#10;The game also included rules for alternate species that had special abilities and significantly different motivations, represented by different victory conditions.&#10;&#10;"

The object is to get all your plane pieces into the base of your color in the center of the map.&#10;&#10;Each player has 4 planes in their starting base. Each turn you roll the die and move one plane of your color on the board.  To get your planes out of your base and onto the board you must roll a 6.  You get an extra turn whenever you roll a 6. If your plane happens to end up on top of another person's plane, that person's plane must go back to their base until he or she rolls a 6 again to get it out onto the board.&#10;&#10;On the board there are colored spaces that coincide with each player. If you land on your own color, you can immediately jump to the next block of your color.  There are also certain colored squares that offer shortcuts across the board.  You may only use the shortcuts that coincide with your color.  If you land on a colored square and subsequently jump to a shortcut square, you may also take the shortcut (essentially jumping twice in one turn).  If you ever land on your own piece, you may &quot;stack&quot; the pieces and move them as one piece until they reach the center or are landed on by an opponent and sent back as individuals.&#10;&#10;The first player to get all of their planes to the center of the board wins, and the rest play until there is only 1 loser. To land in the center of the board, you must roll the exact amount of spaces.&#10;&#10;It is very similar to Pachisi and especially Aggravation.

14561,,"&quot;Second Empire&quot; is a Sci-Fi 4x multi-player board-wargame published more than a decade before the term &quot;4x&quot; was even coined by Alan Emrich in his &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; September 1993 preview of Master of Orion.&#10;&#10;Loosely based on any of a number of Science Fiction stories (such as the Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov) where a Galactic Empire reached its zenith and subsequently collapsed plunging civilization into the dark ages without FTL travel.  And then eventually several of the remnant groups head back to the stars, begin reclaiming old colonies, and attempt to form the Second Empire.  &#10;2-4 players attempt to reform the empire through aggressive exploration and expansion -- confronting each other when encountered.&#10;&#10;According to Sid Sackson's &quot;A Gamut of Games&quot;: Using a stock of raw materials, each player constructs his own space navy. The ships are sent into space, to do battle and to search for raw materials and the lost technologies of the First Empire.&#10;&#10;This game has been supplanted by more sophisticated 4x games such as Throneworld, Twilight Imperium, Space Empires, and Eclipse, but if you are a student of the genre or just looking for a nostalgic old-school experience, you owe it to yourself to give this title a whirl.&#10;&#10;"
