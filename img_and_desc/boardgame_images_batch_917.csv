At the end of the round, knowledge can also be used to control a golem that surpassed its students, but if one of these creatures is uncontrolled, it may become dangerous and destroy the neighborhood, after which you will have to destroy and bury it!&#10;&#10;The marble color also matters, because at the end of the round, if you get the correct combination of two colors, you receive the favor of one of the powerful Prague characters, which will differ each round.&#10;&#10;At the end of the fourth round, players score points for active or buried golems, artifacts, books, development on their personal board, and collected goal cards.&#10;&#10;"

The game has three wooden boards with 4x4 grids, and 48 chips marked on one side.&#10;&#10;Donden was created through collaboration, born out of a project to see if something could be done using thinned wood from Sagamihara City. The game is packaged in a wrapped sleeve, made of Japanese paper. The chips are stored in the back side of the boards.&#10;&#10;The three boards are arranged in a line. The players place two chips each from their supply in the centre, one player using the marked side.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, a player either places a chip on the board, looking to attack as in Reversi, by flipping opponent's chips. Or a player may discard a chip and move one of the three boards around (a disturbance), thus causing an attack.&#10;&#10;By taking an end board, for example, the player can place it at right angles, making an L-shape. This puts one of their pieces outside their opponent's, causing an attack.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player runs out of chips. The other player gets a final turn. Then the players get a point for each chip they have on the board, plus a point for each chip left in hand (not discards). The player with the most points wins.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Various sizes of boards are possible, from short games on a 5x5 grid played with pencil and paper, to longer games on a Go board (9x9, 13x13, or 19x19). &#10;&#10;&#10;THE BASIC IDEA:&#10;&#10;The game begins with an auction phase -- a sort of mini-game of chicken (reminiscent of Unlur), in which an initially empty board is gradually seeded with a growing number of initial stones.  The auction phase determines who will play the role of &quot;Pip&quot; (using black stones) and who will play the role of &quot;Zip&quot; (using white stones).&#10;&#10;After the auction phase ends and the roles are thereby determined, the players take turns playing stones of their color to the board.  Play continues until a winning condition is reached. (Draws are impossible.)  Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides of the board via a chain of orthogonally-adjacent black stones.  Zip wins connecting all FOUR sides of the board via a chain of 8-way-adjacent white stones. (&quot;8-way-adjacent&quot; = either orthogonally or diagonally adjacent.)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;IN MORE DETAIL:&#10;&#10;There are two varieties of play, &quot;Zipline&quot; and &quot;Pipline&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Pipline:&#10;&#10;This is the standard version of the game. The game begins with an empty board and an &quot;auction phase.&quot; In this phase, on his/her turn a player places 1-3 BLACK stones onto empty points on the board. (Each player has a free choice of whether to place 1 black stone, or 2 black stones, or 3 black stones on his/her turn.) Players alternate turns, playing black stones exclusively in this phase of the game, until one player on his/her turn says &quot;Take&quot; instead of placing any stones.  This taker is henceforth known as &quot;Pip&quot; and will play a SINGLE black stone on each future turn.  The opponent (i.e. the non-taker) is &quot;Zip,&quot; who will play a SINGLE white stone on each future turn.&#10;&#10;Immediately after &quot;take&quot; is announced, the non-taker (i.e. Zip) has his/her turn and places a single white stone, followed by a single black stone from Pip, then a single white stone from Zip, etc.  Turns alternate in this fashion until one player achieves his/her win condition (or until one player resigns). Zip wins by connecting all FOUR sides of the board with a chain of white stones that are orthogonally and/or diagonally adjacent; Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides with a chain of black stones that are orthogonally adjacent.&#10;&#10;Pencil-and-Paper Play: Pipline is the recommended version of the game for pencil-and-paper play (draw four vertical lines and four horizontal lines to make a 5x5 grid, as depicted here: https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5173760/cdunc123)&#10;&#10;&#10;Zipline:&#10;&#10;This is an alternative version of the game. To start the game, on each turn a player places 1-3 WHITE stones in the auction phase. (Each player has a free choice of whether to place 1 white stone, or 2 white stones, or 3 white stones on his/her turn.) Players alternate turns, playing white stones exclusively in this phase of the game, until one player on his/her turn says &quot;take&quot; instead of placing any stones.  This taker is henceforth known as &quot;Zip&quot; and on future turns Zip will play a SINGLE white stone per turn.  The opponent (i.e. the non-taker) is known as &quot;Pip.&quot; On future turns, Pip will play TWO black stones per turn, with the following restriction:  Pip's second black stone of a given turn is NOT allowed to be placed orthogonally adjacent to the first black stone of the turn. (Placing two diagonally adjacent black stones in the same turn IS allowed. Also, note that in the extremely rare case where ALL remaining empty cells are orthogonally adjacent to first black stone, the second black stone is forfeited.)&#10;&#10;Immediately after &quot;take&quot; is announced, the non-taker (i.e. Pip) has his/her turn and plays two black stones, followed by a single white stone played by Zip, then two black stones from Pip, then a single white stone from Zip, etc.  Turns alternate in this fashion until one player achieves his/her win condition (or until one player resigns).  Zip wins by connecting all FOUR sides of the board with a chain of white stones that are orthogonally and/or diagonally adjacent; Pip wins by connecting any TWO opposite sides with a chain of black stones that are orthogonally adjacent.&#10;&#10;&quot;Freestyle&quot; Variant: For variety you can play Zipline with free placement for Pip's two black stones, that is, with no ban on orthogonally adjacent placements in the same turn.&#10;&#10;Three-Person Pippinzip: The Zipline version of Pippinzip can also be played as a 3 player game.  In 3 player Zipline, the taker plays as Zip and the two non-takers play as a single Pip team.  Each non-taker plays a single black stone on his/her turn, for a total of two black stones for Pip for every one white stone for Zip.  Roles are determined in the auction phase using the same process described for 3 player Unlur in this thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1706872/unlur-three-people.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;MISCELLANEOUS NOTES&#10;&#10;&#10;     Before the game, players should agree whether to place stones on the intersections of the game board grid (as in Go) or alternatively, place stones within the cells of the game board grid.  Either mode of play is fine; it is a matter of personal choice.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The board starts out empty.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Placement must always be to an EMPTY intersection or cell (depending on which mode was agreed before the start of the game).  There is no capture or displacement of enemy stones in Pippinzip.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Once placed, stones never move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     If during the auction phase, a player creates the win condition for the color being used in the auction phase, then that player wins the game.  (However, this won't happen if both players play competently!)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Ltd. In the same way that European language fonts come in different designs (Times New Roman, Gill Sans) and different styles and weights (Gothic, Bold), many fonts are also designed for the Japanese alphabet Hiragana. Fontworks produced a popular commercial font called &#231;&#173;&#145;&#231;&#180;&#171; (Chikushi), which is then produced in various styles and weights.&#10;&#10;The game uses a set of tiles which only show a single character &#227;&#129;&#130; (A). The tiles are all varied though, because of the variations in the different Chikushi fonts used.&#10;&#10;The game Font HUNT comes in three different foil packs.

But if a player cannot make a connection add to 10, they are not penalised.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to connect their starting tile on the outside of the board to the central tile.&#10;&#10;The designers suggest an alternate for children who cannot add up, so that they need only have numbers match when played.&#10;&#10;Alternately, they suggest you play the game in a terrible windstorm.&#10;&#10;"

Lovecraft. In this game you will assume the role of Abdul Alhazred with the aim of completing all sections of the aberrant book. It is a game for 2 to 4 players with game modes for 20 or 60 minutes. Necronomicon is presented in a limited edition that continues The Writer, and comes with the amazing art of Fran&ccedil;ois Launet (Goominet), with exclusive Cthulhu pawns for the sanity count (collector&rsquo;s edition) and an impressive Necronomicon book case made by hand, in wood, in antique book format (Deluxe edition).&#10;&#10;How to play: The objective of the game is to complete the Necronomicon. Each player is dealt five cards at the beginning of the game. Each card represents part of a section of the book. Each section of the book is completed by collecting at least 5 cards from that specific section, identified by a symbol. The game is divided into several rounds, each of which ends when a player manages to complete a certain number of sections of the book (each round will be more complicated than the previous one). The complete sections of the book are marked with tokens until the Necronomicon is completed and the game is won.&#10;&#10;During a turn there are only two moves: draw card (to choose from the deck or the discard pile) and perform an action by placing a card on the table, which will serve to bring new cards into the hand or to get rid of others mainly. You'll have to decide whether to sacrifice an important card to take advantage of the card's action or to play more conservatively. The card that is played on the table is available for the next player, who in turn will decide whether to draw it or take a new one from the deck.&#10;&#10;Once a round is finished (managing to complete the sections of the book and discarding the remaining cards) the tokens are placed on the completed sections of the book and the players who have been left with cards in hand will lose sanity points.&#10;&#10;The rounds follow each other until all the sections of the Necronomicon are completed and the game is won.&#10;&#10;"

Set in Portugal in the late 15th century, King Afonso V enters into a trade agreement with Lisbon's great merchant Ferdinand Gomez. Instead of granting subsidies to explore, the agreement entitles Gomez to exclusive trade in the specialty products obtained from the voyages. Players become one of the admirals employed by Ferdinand Gomez, pioneering the wilderness, discovering unknown creatures and natural wonders, building harbors and trading posts, trading, and preaching Christianity. Players want to increase their fame and become the world's best admiral.&#10;&#10;Proving that the world is round, a new world map similar to &mdash; but not identical to &mdash; the real world will be created. Initially the game board shows a large map of the world known to Europeans in the 15th century, with all of Europe being depicted along with parts of Asia and Africa. The rest of the board is blank, and players place land tiles as they travel across the seas. In this way, they literally complete a new atlas (rather than trying to mimic the actual globe), and the game will play out differently each session.&#10;&#10;As players draw tiles and discover new lands, they also close off potential sea routes. Balancing the need to discover and the need to trade is one of the game's challenges. Building a church and propagating Christianity to a greater extent also increases a player's fame.&#10;&#10;"
