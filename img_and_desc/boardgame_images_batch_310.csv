Ten clues are provided on each card. Ten points are given for the correct answer on the first clue, nine for the second, eight for the third, etc. However, no set amount of points for victory is specified in the rules; perhaps that's the Bible Secret in question. As Ned Flanders might say, see how long it takes you to answer 100 points worth of Bible questions, then try to break that record.&#10;&#10;From box front:&#10;&quot;Leisure time activities that sharpen the mind and improve the character are true Christian recreation.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Each move is a random length and takes a random time (rolled on two separate dice); the game starts with 72 hours before the eclipse - the duration of each move is deducted from each player's personal 'clock'.  In the process the players also have to earn money by doing bits of casual work here and there in order to have the &pound;50 entrance fee that admittance to the &quot;optimum viewing site&quot; requires for admittance.  If time gets tight the players even have the opportunity to visit Merlin's Cave at Tintagel to be sent back in time after completing a task for him.&#10;&#10;It's a strange game, probably more interesting as a curiosity/souvenir than for gameplay.  The quality of components and printing is very good, although most of the graphics used in the game appear to be royalty-free clip art, along with a rather varied selection of fonts.&#10;&#10;"

(Clangers lived on the moon and used dustbin lids as doors - just accept it.)&#10;&#10;The players (there's no upper limit stated) are dealt out the twenty five cards in the deck, taking turns to turn over a dustbin lid and if the revealed character matches a card in their hand, they take the token.

They get points for each move they make. The more fingers there are in &quot;holds&quot; (holes on cards) at the end of a move, the more they get points. Performing complex manoeuvres is the key, since each hold is bordered by a color. One finger can only go in one color! Beware, if the cards move, your turn ends.&#10;&#10;The route is changed a little bit between each round.&#10;&#10;The player with most points after 3 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;"

Players erode their mountains with the processes they successfully bid on and acquire. The sediment supplied to the delta becomes the coinage used in the bidding process. Mountains uplift 1,500 meters per turn until one player reaches 8,000 meters, or until the &quot;Active Uplift Shutdown&quot; event card is drawn. Then, it's a race to see who can erode their mountain away the fastest. When a player successfully erodes their mountain, the game ends. The winner is the player with the most sediment in their delta, after subtracting any sediment that remains in their mountain.&#10;&#10;To the play the game, you need to print out a copy of the rules, the bidding row, the game cards (the card types include event, process, mountain front, and mountain type), and enough game boards for the number of players that will play. A cool rock and a cup to hold the sediment is also needed. You will also need to buy a couple boxes of Jujubees (you can eat them while you play), as they are the &quot;sediment&quot; used in the game.&#10;&#10;The designer recommended printing the game materials (except the rules) in color, on 11&quot; x 17&quot; cardstock. To make the game, the designer recommended using a paper cutter, a glue stick, scissors (for minor clean up), and scotch tape.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Erosion&quot; v. 1.0 ZIP file was available for download as of May 9, 2008 at the designer's former webpage&#10;&#10;The files have been unavailable since Sierra Madre Games announced that they were publishing a revised version of Erosion in 2009.&#10;&#10;"

You will meet the various personalities that make up the island and must bribe, steal or buy to accomplish your mission.  However, others will be attempting to do the same.  So, be smart.  First you must try to earn the ear of the council person to tell you where the best deal in town can be found.  Only the highest bidder will get the location known only to them.  Being a smart treasure seeker, you may follow quietly and search the area around where the high bidder goes.  Unfortunately for everyone, people only have a limited number of crystals.  Once a site has been visited, no one may visit again.&#10;&#10;"
