The nine different Barbapapa figures are placed on the board with the card faces down.&#10;Movement consists of rolling a die and moving. There are spaces on the board that will cause the playing piece to be moved to another space when it is landed upon.&#10;The game is aimed at children, from about 5 years of age. It is very simple, but an easy to learn entry game.&#10;&#10;"

Stores are established in spaces on the apple-shaped board, and players manage their inventory by holding onto cards representing goods.  These cards are purchased from warehouse spaces and frequently change hands since a player is obliged to purchase a card whenever he or she lands on an opponent's store.  The maximum price which may be charged for an item depends on the number of floors in a store, so players are constantly expanding their outlets.&#10;&#10;The game deals with more than just cash -- every player gets a balance sheet used for tracking bank loans and credit with other players.  Credit limits are determined at the start of the game and affect the length of the game -- a $300 limit is recommended for an hour-long game, while $500 can last two hours or more.  As players reach their credit limits and are unable to pay back their creditors, they go bankrupt and drop out of the game.&#10;&#10;In addition to the normal flow of buying and selling, the game features board spaces and cards that spice up gameplay with random events.  There are also some special transportation spaces (taxis and subways) which allow players a little more control over their movement to add variety to the normal rolling and moving.&#10;&#10;Big Apple obviously draws a lot of inspiration from Monopoly, but it's not just a retheming -- there are enough differences to make it distinct from its more famous predecessor.&#10;&#10;"

One player is selected as the caller, shuffles his/her tiles and draws them one by one from a bag. He/she calls the number drawn. Each player takes that number from one of his/her horizontal rows. If it is a 1, he/she can start one of his/her three new main rows. If it is any other number, it has to be placed in an auxiliary column first.&#10;&#10;Each player may have up to 5 vertical auxiliary columns of any length. There must not be any gaps (i.e. tiles must be placed directly below one another), and tiles must not be rearranged later. Tiles need not be placed in sequence, but they should be placed in a way that allows for efficient removal to construct the main rows. Tiles may only be taken from the auxiliary columns starting at the bottom (not in the middle or top), and main rows can only be started when a 1 has been called.&#10;&#10;Each of the three new rows has to be started with a 1. The tiles have to be placed in correct sequence here. A 3 can only be placed after a 2, and so on. Tiles can be taken from the auxiliary columns (without being called again) as soon as the number at the bottom directly follows one at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows. E.g. if there is a 3 at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows and a 4 at one of his/her auxiliary columns, the 4 may be taken and placed next to the 3 in the main row. Tiles can be taken from the bottom of the auxiliary columns as long as they are in matching sequence.&#10;&#10;The player who first completes his/her three rows wins the game. If no player is able to complete all three rows by the time the caller calls the last number, the player with the fewest tiles left wins instead.&#10;__________________&#10;&#10;One of Ravensburger&#039;s Traveller-Series games.&#10;&#10;"

Play several games of Feud with the Basic Rules.  Once you have grasped them soundly, the Advanced Rules will bring the true excitement of Feud to light.

It is similar in mechanics to Sorry! with dice in place of cards and marbles in place of movers. The players roll a die in hopes of throwing a 1 to leave their start space in the moulded plastic game base. Traveling the track of the board, it is a race to see who can get all 4 of their marbles into their home first. When you land on a space occupied by another player you call out &quot;skat&quot; and send that player back to their starting spot.&#10;&#10;In a 4 player game, you can play as teams with the goal of getting the 8 team marbles back prior to the other team. Once a player has all 4 of his in the home spaces, he can begin to move his partners marbles.&#10;&#10;Another version of the game is Wild Skat, using an extra hole in the center of the board. This extra hole allows you the opportunity to cross the board in fewer moves, but increases your chance of being &quot;skatted&quot; by your opponent.&#10;&#10;"

When it passes the stable stone, the turn player may take one kernel stone out of the circle.&#10;The player with the first 3 colored kernel stones wins.&#10;&#10;"
