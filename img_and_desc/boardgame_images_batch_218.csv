Some of the doorways are blocked by barrels.  Each turn, a player rolls a die to determine the number of steps to move from room to room.  For each step, the player moves her marker one space, may then reposition one barrel, and then must move the ringmaster one space towards herself following the shortest path.  Players can't move through barrels or into occupied rooms.  The ringmaster can't move through barrels (or reposition them) but may move through other players.  If the ringmaster 'catches' the active player, the game ends and all other players win.&#10;&#10;Stumpy the Cave Boy was originally slated for release as CAG 012 in October 1997.  A last minute decision removed it from the production schedule.  The game was retooled as Escape from Dork Tower and published in John Kovalic's Dork Tower in 1999.  Stumpy the Cave Boy became a celebrated martyr of Cheapass Games, and stock number 012 has been retired.  It was finally published in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.&#10;&#10;"

Each radar is surrounded by three rings, marked 1 (=inner) to 3 (=outer), and each radar zone is divided into 6 pie-parts, except for the central radar zone, which has 12 pie-parts. The radars themselves are small dots at the center of each zone. The outer 6 radars each have 2 pie-bits connected to a neighbor. One movable radar beam is placed on each station, covering a sixth of each circular area, and a beam half that size is  placed in the central zone. Each player takes ownership of an equal amount of outer radar posts, and gets a small squadrons in the same color. These are then placed on the starting fields on the outer edge of the board, just outside their own radar post zone.&#10;&#10;Using dice, 2-6 players try to keep their fleet of planes under the radar, and the first one to sneak 3 planes of one color into the center zone is the winning commander.&#10;&#10;In turn, players will first move the radar beam at their own station forwards. The beam speed depends on the activity within the zone. Any planes that get caught by the sweeping beam have to abort their attempt to reach the center, and return to their start location to start another approach.&#10;&#10;After that, the planes move, by rolling 4 dice. Planes are under no obligation to move, but when a die gets allocated to a plane, the entire move has to be made. Planes start on the outer rim and move, avoiding the area covered by the radar beam, clockwise or anti-clockwise, along the ring it is currently occupying. However, in the pie-part that touches its neighbor, planes have an opportunity to &quot;flop&quot; radar stations instead of continuing on their current track. When they do flop, they move their plane to the other station's pie-part, but place the plane one ring closer to that's station's radar than the one they just left.&#10;&#10;When a plane leaves the most central track and flops right on top of a neighboring radar, called the blitz-field, that plane is then immediately moved to the outer ring of the central radar, which is surrounded by 2 rings. Each subsequent plane of that color that manages to make it to the central zone undetected, arrives one ring closer to its center. When the third plane of a color pops up on the most central ring, that player is the winner.&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, the central radar also sweeps forwards, the speed again depending on how crowded the central zone is, and detected planes must abort and start their mission again from the beginning. After each round a new turn-order is established.&#10;&#10;This is a fairly abstract race game, using a novel mechanic, that works quite well. It is probably slightly more complex than the average Spielbox game, but simple enough to appeal to a family audience.&#10;&#10;Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (4/1984 oct-dec), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. Its novel movement mechanism made it the winner in Spielbox' &quot;Invent-a-Game&quot; competition.

When a rendezvous takes place, the visiting player needs to guess the local way to say &quot;hi&quot;, which is made through a sequence of gestures and salutations, 4 in all. Depending on how accurate a player's greeting is, that player will receive a gift, which gives a clue to how close the attempt was to the real McCoy. The question is, which mastermind can deduct all the secret alien handshakes?&#10;&#10;The board shows six solar systems arranged in a circle. A seventh solar system is placed at the center of this. Each solar system has 13 planets orbiting a sun, in 3 orbits. Where solar systems touch each other, there are planets facing each other on the outer ring, creating places where UFOs can hop between systems. With the exception of the central system, each solar system has one distinctive home planet. There are unique 24 handshake cards, grouped in 4 sets of 6. Each player gets 5 gift counters.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player picks a home planet and places the two flying saucers on it. All players then get their unique 4 part hand-shake sequence, which gets written down on a private note sheet. Unused cards are exposed, so players can cross them off as possible candidates. Each player then allocates the values 0-4 to their 5 gifts, which is also written down on the sheet and kept hidden from opponents.&#10;&#10;In turn, players can allocate between 1 and 4 movement points to their 2 UFO's, in any way they see fit. UFO's move clockwise from planet to planet, and are allowed to change orbit, and even solar system. Each planet offers room for only 2 UFO's though, and these have to belong to different players too. When 2 UFO's meet on the same planet, a rendezvous takes place.&#10;&#10;The arriving player takes a guess (aloud) at the correct greeting sequence of the other alien. Depending the amount of correctly guessed elements, the alien will return a gift to this player. This gift has the same value as the amount of correct guesses, but what that value is, is another thing that has to be deduced by the other players. When a player has already handed over the gift with that value, the visiting player will be told that no gift can be made. All this information is available to all players.&#10;&#10;Landing on another player's home planet opens up another opportunity to get that player to reveal another clue. When a player gives back a gift previously obtained from that tribe, the owner of the home planet must return a greeting that has the same value as the returned gift, but also one that has not been made before.&#10;&#10;A players cannot establish a rendezvous between the same two spaceships in 2 subsequent turns, and must leave a solar system before another landing on the same home planet may be made.&#10;&#10;When a player greets all other players with the correct salutations, than that player is the winner. You're only allowed one guess though, so don't expect it to be made fast.&#10;&#10;This is a great addition to the deduction genre, sitting comfortably next to Cluedo and Mastermind, despite lower production values. With each additional player, game length increases a bit, and an alternative victory condition, guessing only the handshake of the players on your immediate left and right, is suggested for 5 and 6 player games. Where most of these games use indicators that give players direct clues about the accuracy of a guess (for instance, a red peg is a correct guess but not in its right place), here the added complication is that the true meaning of these pegs (the gifts) must also be established, setting player's quite a puzzling logic challenge.&#10;&#10;Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (1/1985 feb-mar), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It was the runner up in Spielbox magazine's &quot;Invent-a-Game&quot; competition, losing out to Radar Flop.

Too many of these game systems require an excessive amount of log keeping and the use of overly long sets of tables. A need for referees and a lot of pencil pushing detracts from the enjoyment of the game.&#10;&#10;The other problem with many fantasy rules is that they bear little relation to the literary fantasy tradition. These games tend to rely upon vast numbers of omnipotent beings and spell-casting wizards rather than the strategic capabilities of a kingdom's legions of ordinary soldiers.&#10;&#10;Archworld is intended to provide a reasonable and easy-to-understand accounting of the uses of weapons and armor of the period, and the strategy of empire making and the like. The gamer who is not interested in the re-fighting of Archworld battles may simply disregard the fantasy elements and still use these rules to create realistic battle situations for any period up to the late 1600s.&#10;&#10;Bases and Scale:&#10;&#10;Scales is given in terms of paces, with one real inch equaling ten paces, one scale pace equals 2 1/2 feet (or 1 mm. equals 1 foot). All movement and the proper sizes of bases can be worked our from this scale. As a rule, one figure equals twenty men, except in the case of personality figures, which obviously are one to one.&#10;&#10;Archworld also contains a complete set of rules for naval combat.&#10;&#10;Archworld also includes a 4 panel paper foldout map of Archworld, 3 single sided sheets of cardboard ship cutouts (these are not counters-the cut outs of the ships are much larger and are used for naval miniatures combat), and 2 single sided cardstock sheets of reference charts.&#10;&#10;"

The Tour was opposed by a coalition of anti-racist groups in New Zealand. The result was a watershed in NZ politics, as the previously peaceful and harmonious country was bitterly divided by the violence that resulted from the confrontation between these opposing elements. In particular, the NZ Police force emerged without its previous positive image as an agent of fairness and social cohesion.&#10;&#10;The name &ldquo;Political Football&rdquo; is a play on the common expression in NZ and elsewhere, where a contentious issue may be referred to in this way, particularly where the original problem has a non-political nature but when there may be an element of political opportunism apparent. In the case of the Rugby Tour, as well as being literally descriptive, there was an element of cynicism readily evident in the controversy.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Game Play is generally intuitive, and the number of Counters ( total 21 only) means play is readily comprehensible as well as fast moving. There are no dice, but some small randomness in the appearance of some features earlier or later. There is only one &ldquo;scenario&rdquo; and the whole Game must be played to determine a winner. Time for whole Game is about 2 hours&#10;&#10;The Game has four protagonists&#10;1. The Demonstrators, who seek to disrupt the Tour to the extent that it must be abandoned&#10;2. The Rugby groups, who seek to complete the scheduled Tour.&#10;3. The Police, who seek to allow the Rugby to conduct their lawful business of playing Rugby&#10;4. The Government, which manipulates the other Players, seeking to extract maximum political advantage from a Law &amp; Order issue&#10;&#10;Everybody except the Government has an inventory of Counters, which are able to move about the board under a movement allowance system, interacting with opposing counters. Players also have a suite of Action Cards which allow certain Actions to be played. Government uses its Turn to play certain cards influencing the other Players.&#10;&#10;The Board is a stylized representation of &#10;&amp;#61623; four Sports Grounds, where the Rugby matches are scheduled ; &#10;&amp;#61623; a Court, where arrested demonstrators are processed;  &#10;&amp;#61623; a Hospital, where &ldquo;injured&rdquo; Counters wait till released by Government. &#10;&amp;#61623; between these venues, a gridded surface of &ldquo;streets&rdquo;, across which the Counters move from place to place. Only one Counter is allowed on any one square; counters cannot &ldquo;jump&rdquo; other counters.&#10;&#10;The Tactics of the Game involve each Player trying to &#10;a. achieve certain mandatory objectives ( eg Rugby fielding sufficient Counters at the same time and place to actually play a match !).&#10;b. prevent Opposing Players establishing themselves in such a way as to frustrate opposition objectives.&#10;&#10;Progress is measured and the Game won, by accumulation of Points for performing certain Actions ( eg for Rugby ,&ldquo;Play the Match&rdquo;; for Demonstrators &ldquo; Destroy the Goal posts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confront Police&rdquo;).&#10;&#10;In short, each Player can ( and must) adopt a mix of Offensive and Defensive play.&#10;In general, all Counters can &ldquo;bash&rdquo; all other counters, putting them out of action for an extended but indeterminable time; while the Police have the power to arrest Demonstrators, removing them (briefly) from play. All counters can be also used to form defensive &ldquo;walls&rdquo;, preventing opponents from achieving their objectives (eg preventing Rugby Counters from getting to the Sports ground to play their game&hellip;).&#10;&#10;These tactics will be familiar to anyone who has ever attended a political demonstration, particularly a violent one.&#10;&#10;This Game has a number of very interesting features :&#10;1. the protagonists are a-symmetrical in numbers, capacities and objectives yet play is finely balanced,&#10;2.  Both the Police and Rugby lose Points by attacking Demonstrators, but may lose more by NOT doing so!&#10;3. While the non-Demonstrator Players have mutual interests, these are NOT identical &ndash; leading to subtle conflicts that preclude any lasting alliance.&#10;4. The result see-saws wildly throughout the Game&#10;5. Novice Players learn rapidly how their tactics need to change&#10;6. No Player is ever permanently eliminated, which upsets novices !&#10;7. Players offensive capacities are governed by non-recurring Action Cards : when to use them is a matter of judging opportunity.&#10;8. Play often appears counter-intuitive to novices, but in fact is an accurate simulation of this particular variety of conflict, ie the maintenance of Law &amp; Order in a democratic society where Police powers are limited by Human Rights considerations. Playing the Game itself demonstrates these principles powerfully.&#10;&#10;In summary, this is a unique and workable game system that provides for very subtle calculations of both short term tactics as well as longer term objectives, within a simple set of rules.&#10;&#10;"
