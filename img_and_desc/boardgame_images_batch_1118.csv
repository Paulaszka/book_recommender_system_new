Lay the 17 wooden bits in a circle around the cards, then place the arrow next to a bit to create a starting point in the line. Each player takes a set of cards numbered 1-6.&#10;&#10;The first player takes the first six bits in line, along with the building platform and sunglasses, then shuffles their deck and secretly looks at the bottommost card. They now have 30 seconds to use the wooden bits to recreate the image on the associated construction card, balancing bits as they wish, but not moving them to create an animated scene.&#10;&#10;The other players can each play one card face down into the central hexagon to guess which construction card the active player is building. Once time runs out or everyone has guessed, the active player forecasts how many others correctly guessed the answer, then reveals all the cards. Whoever first guessed the correct answer scores 2 points, with the second correct guesser earning 1 point. If at least one person guessed correctly, the builder scores 1 point, and if they forecast correctly, they score a bonus 1 point.&#10;&#10;The builder then places all used bits at the end of the line and passes unused bits to the next player clockwise, with that player taking bits from the line as needed to have six on hand.&#10;&#10;After everyone has been builder twice (with 5-6 players) or thrice (with 3-4 players), whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Place the 36 coffee/milk tiles in the bag, then draw five tiles to fill the milk side of the espresso machine, then five tiles to fill the coffee side. Each double-sided coffee/milk tile has a value from 1-4 as well as a symbol for cold, hot, or foamy. Each player starts with 4-5 coins. Place completed drink tiles in the center of the playing area; each drink (cappuccino, latte macchiato, etc.) has tiles of varying values.&#10;&#10;On a turn, take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take 2 coins from the bank.&#10;     Buy a tile from the espresso machine, with the cost of the tile being equal to the adjacent tile on the opposite side of the machine. If you're buying a milk tile, for example, the cost is the value on the adjacent coffee tile. Tiles in the top two rows have a 1-2 coin surcharge. Place the tile in the lowest empty matching space on one of your drink tiles, then draw a tile from the bag to refill the machine. If you buy a 1 tile, it comes with a bonus sugar cube.&#10;     Serve one or more completed drinks. For each glass tile that has all its spots filled, first gain coins from the bank, earning more coins if the drink has fewer symbols in it. (Mixing cold and hot tiles isn't good!) Next, take a completed drink tile of the same type that has a value equal to or less than the sum of the tiles, gaining coins to make up the difference. You can raise the value of a drink by 1 for each sugar cube spent.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you can spend 2 coins to flush one side of the espresso machine, then refill it.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has served all five types of drinks, complete the round, then sum the value of your completed drink tiles, with each pair of sugar cubes counting as 1 point. Whoever has the most points wins, with coin serving as a tiebreaker.&#10;&#10;"

The sea level is irrevocably rising, and the vast depths of the ocean now lie above the former land areas. Inspired by Jules Verne's visions and equipped with the latest technology, a deep sea city &mdash; &quot;New Eden&quot; &mdash; is being built, with the main dome standing on a &quot;White Smoker&quot;, a spring at the bottom of the sea from which hot water flows at up to 300 &deg;C.&#10;&#10;This current forms a basic supply for the inhabitants (represented in game by coins), and from there, the station is constantly being expanded and enlarged with useful modules from the last mega-factories on the coast of Mount Everest or from the black market in order to receive further resources, points, and lucrative advantages. Many of these well-intentioned actions can damage &quot;New Eden&quot;, however. Will the station withstand this damage, or will it collapse in on itself? Only those who keep an eye on the balance between progress and destruction can collect points in the final scoring. Whoever has built the most points and thus the safest and most livable station wins &quot;New Eden&quot;.&#10;&#10;In more detail, New Eden lasts three rounds. Each round, first reveal the module cards and place them in four rows. Players take turns buying a card from the display, using oxygen to take an action with a diver on a module, or passing. When you buy a card, the cost can vary from 10 coins + 3 repaired damage to 1 coin + 1 damage. When a row is empty, all cards drop down one level, making them cheaper, but potentially damaging. Discard all cards on display once everyone has passed.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, enter the black market phase. Each player takes three cards from the black market deck, with remaining cards placed in rows on the display. Pay for any cards with coins and damage, then place the remaining cards in a row of the display.&#10;&#10;Players then bid on a row in the display, with each row having a combination of discard black market cards and empty spaces, which allow you to move a diver and activate a module. Once all four rows have been auctioned, players have a brief scoring and clean-up before the next round.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, if your level of damage exceeds the meter on your board, you score no endgame points, keeping only those points scored during play. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

Like its predecessor, it covers the German Wacht am Rhein offensive in December 1944 against the heretofore &ldquo;quiet front&rdquo; of the Ardennes Forest.&#10;&#10;Despite heavy losses on both the Western and Eastern Fronts, the German Army attempted to re-invigorate its offensive forces using drafts of the elderly, infirm, and very young.   The defending US forces were recovering from the dash across France and using the Ardennes area to give exhausted units a chance to refit and to give their new reinforcements some modest battle-zone experience.&#10;&#10;The result went down in history as the Battle of the Bulge.&#10;&#10;Overcoming the initial surprise, the US forces put together a series of determined defenses, numerous timely bridge destructions, and the incredible power of their well-supplied artillery to stop the vaunted German Panzer troops nearly dead in their tracks.&#10;&#10;Ardennes II covers all this action in turns representing one day of combat and a hex scale of 1 mile per hex. Units are usually reinforced battalions (or smaller). The full campaign game lasts only 16 turns from 16 Dec to 31 Dec 44.&#10;&#10;In addition to spotlighting the better OOB and map research first used in Last Blitzkrieg, the game differs from its predecessor by highlighting the unique nature of the artillery on both sides, correcting the original&rsquo;s &ldquo;Supply Wagon&rdquo; supply system, as well as giving units the opportunity to withdraw before an enemy attack. It also cuts back on the amount of chrome rules which the player needed to wade through, and which exaggerated the effects of some marginal forces.&#10;&#10;The game continues the SCS tradition of a very clean and easily played Sequence of Play, clear unit interactions, and straight-forward victory determination.&#10;&#10;This game is highly recommended for those interested in learning for the first time or teaching the fine hobby of wargaming to beginners.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;Ardennes Campaign, 2 maps, 16 turns&#10;Breakthrough Campaign, 1 map, 6 turns&#10;KG Peiper, part of 1 map, 5 turns&#10;The Goose Egg, part of 1 map, 5 turns&#10;Bastogne: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, parts of 2 maps, 8 turns&#10;Tip of the Spear, 1 map, 4 turns&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The deck features 4 suits (Knights, Archers, Spearmen, Swordsman) ranked 1 to 10. The deck also includes 2 unsuited Ambush cards. The goal of the game is to avoid getting eliminated from play and to take the final trick of the game.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over 6 rounds. At the start of each round players are dealt a hand of cards, receiving one less during the deal in each subsequent round (6 in round one, 5 in round two, etc). A random trump suit is revealed from the top of the undealt card deck. Players will try to take tricks using standard &quot;must follow&quot; rules. The winner of a trick is determined by assessing who played the highest value in the lead suit or the highest valued trump. When following suit, the unsuited Ambush cards may be played at any time whether suit can be followed or trumped. Ambush cards rank higher than any suited card, including trump. However, when resolving a trick that includes an Ambush, if a 1 rank card in any suit is present the Ambush is ineligible to win the trick. If both Ambush cards are played to the same trick, the second played wins.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, any players who have taken zero tricks are eliminated from the game. The player who wins the most tricks in a round will be the lead player of the next. The game continues until one of the following occurs:&#10;&#10;1) A player wins the game by collecting all tricks in a round, leaving all other players with zero tricks.&#10;&#10;2) A player wins the game by making it to round 6 and winning the final trick.&#10;&#10;There is an optional variant called &quot;Guerrilla Operations&quot;. The game is played the same, except the first time a player takes zero tricks in a round they are not eliminated. Instead, in the following round they are dealt a single card. During that round, on their turn they may play this card into any trick of their choosing. If they don't want to play it into a trick they may pass. If a player can use this card to win a trick they will re-enter the game in the following round. A player is only eligible to receive the single card second chance if it's the first time they end a round with zero tricks. If a player collects zero tricks for a second time after having re-entered the game previously or fails to win a trick with their single second chance card, they are eliminated.&#10;&#10;"

Players will take the role of agents from one of the six great rail factions, assemble their train and crew, and brave the wilds in order to keep humanity&rsquo;s few remaining cities connected and supplied. There&rsquo;s a fortune to be made and history to be written by those courageous enough to journey through the rail wilderness.&#10;&#10;Part wargame, part worker placement game, part resource management game, Derailed is a fun and exciting experience for 1-6 players with numerous ways to play, adding levels of depth and complexity to suit any player; casual boardgame players through to avid wargamers will find something to love, from the rich setting with a wealth of lore, to a ruleset that's easy to learn but hard to master. Six different factions offer a variety of play styles based on their unique special rules.&#10;&#10;The objective of Derailed is simple enough: complete your journey alive and with the most tickets in hand. To do so, you first build your train, hire crew and purchase supplies for the voyage. Six different engine types, eight different carriages and a wide selection of weapons and upgrades affords you plenty of options to create your own unique train. Crew are your resource for performing actions aboard your train, represented by dice. Once you have your train and crew ready, load up with fuel, cargo and passengers to make your trek as profitable as possible.
