Don&rsquo;t smell the gunpowder in the air or the scent of perfume coming from the whorehouses or the aftershave of the mobsters hanging around the corner.&#10;&#10;Stay alert, grab your bucks before your enemies beat you to it, build your gang fast and better than all the rest.  Because the next thing you smell could be the flowers on your grave.&#10;&#10;The game is based by an innovative system of play called &quot;confronts&quot;: each mobster, according to his skills to do an action, must confront the power of the Gang (coming from influence tokens) with all other powers in the same district.&#10;&#10;Each of the players plays a Boss of a Gang on Chicago or the Police Chief at the beginning of the 1920. To rule the city, as Boss, you must command your mobsters as pawn to earn money coming from robbery, run clubs and assassinate enemies. If you represent the Law, instead, you must fight the crime with your policemen, closing the clubs, capturing mobsters and also try to send one of the Bosses to jail.&#10;&#10;"

However, the right cards needed in this game may not be the right cards in another game. True, you may pull the same set of cards, but it is highly unlikely there are 531,441 different combinations. You could push ahead getting the right cards in the positions you need them to be in, or do you work to thwart other players efforts. Adding the change a winning combination of the ideal kingdom allows for changes in strategy from one game to the next. Each player starts with three cards and needs to work to create the &ldquo;Ideal Kingdom&rdquo; which is a combination of six cards. Each color of card has specific attacks, defense, and special action. Certain colors cards can only sit next to other certain color cards, and coming in contact with opposing cards leads to inactivity or removal. That has something to do with court politics. Cards are drawn and played in turn order, with actions being directed by the cards you have laid out in front of you. Some of those actions allow you to draw extra cards, look at another player&rsquo;s cards, steal cards, or battle. But, your strategy has to be planned so you can create the ideal kingdom to win. There are 9 major game changer cards in the deck, like creating Immunity from the Black Plague, or Jesters that will play tricks and change the cards. This actually helps the player with the least amount of cards to actually come back and try to win.&#10;&#10;"

Whoever has the most madness in a round either scores 4 points or discards 1 madness token &mdash; and the latter option is valuable because if you ever have nine or more madness, you lose the game immediately.&#10;&#10;"

Upon being attacked combatants will be able to parry or even redirect the attack just like in a true sword fight.

You will inevitably find yourself asking questions like what stance I  need to be in next, should I block or should I hold for a bigger attack, is the opponent faking their threat level, and can I get my attack off before theirs?

Ireland was a poor country, but there is no lack of enthusiasm for railways among investors. Up to 13 5-share companies will start in a random sequence. Some of these companies will become successful, others, as a result of underinvestment, isolation or poor timing will struggle to survive. All is not lost for the strugglers, however. A unique shareholder voting mechanism allows companies to merge into 10-share companies(sometimes against their director&rsquo;s wishes) with their more or less successful neighbours.&#10;Track laying provides its own problems as many track tiles are unique. Often, there is no available tile to provide the most efficient route so a roundabout route sometimes must suffice. There are two types of track that can be built: broad gauge and narrow gauge. There are no purchasable narrow gauge locomotives; instead narrow gauge track operates in an abstract way and boosts the value of the broad gauge stations to which it connects.  &#10;Trains in 18Ireland are hex trains. They become obsolete in two stages: rusted trains may be bought back from the bank at half price (but also half capability) and continue to operate until they rot and are then removed. As the game progresses the train rush becomes brutal. Player bankruptcy does not end the game and survivors continue until they have broken a bank that starts with just &pound;4,000.&#10;18Ireland can be played by 3 to 6 players. Experience has shown that at a low player count, this is a &ldquo;run good companies&rdquo; game. At a higher player count, the game is more combative as share portfolios are more diverse and the hostile merger becomes a bigger factor in the game. By choosing the player count, players can select the style of 18xx game that they prefer.&#10;&#10;"

Should you use your own sticks or those of your opponent?  Taking the risk that they will be used up; should you   play them?&#10;Game of observation: which sticks are holding up which others ? You need a good sense of three dimensions.&#10;&#10;

The hand cards are used when racing against opponents (in the form of car cards) or other players.&#10;&#10;When racing, first you pick the track to race on (drag race, Mulholland Drive, or Aqueduct Race). Next, determine your score on the chosen track based on the cards in your hand. The player with the highest score has the best chance to win -- but luck factors into the equation. Draw the next card from the deck and check the Bad Luck number to see whether you won the race or not.&#10;&#10;The player who beats The King, the best opponent in the deck, wins the game!&#10;&#10;"
