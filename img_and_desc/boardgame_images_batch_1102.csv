Each player looks at their Assignments, then chooses 1 to place faceup in front of themselves as their Private Assignment and 1 to place faceup in the Public Assignments area in the center of the play area.&#10;&#10;2.

Each player looks at their hand, chooses 1 card, and places it in a facedown stack in front of themselves.&#10;&#10;Each player then passes their remaining 7 cards to the player on their left. Each player again chooses 1 card and adds it to their facedown stack, then passes their remaining hand to the left.

Players then take turns revealing and activating cards, starting with the player who has the Bus standee and going clockwise around the table.&#10;&#10;On your turn, take the following steps in order:&#10;3.1. Reveal Card: Choose 1 card from your hand and place it faceup in front of yourself.&#10;3.2. Activate Abilities : You may use abilities on your faceup&#10;Cryptid cards. To use each ability, you must activate the card (turn it sideways) along with the required number of cards of the same type (see &ldquo;Activating Cryptid Cards,&rdquo; next page).&#10;3.3. Complete Assignments: If your faceup cards meet the requirements to complete a Public Assignment, claim the card from the center of the play area, place it in front of yourself, and turn it sideways to show it&rsquo;s completed. If you complete your Private Assignment, simply turn it sideways to show it&rsquo;s completed.&#10;&#10;4. End of Round&#10;The round ends once no one has any cards left in their hand.&#10;Gather all Cryptid cards in front of all players (both activated and unactivated) and place them in a discard pile next to the deck. (If a player completed an Assignment that lets them keep a card, they may keep it instead of discarding it.)&#10;&#10;Each player keeps their completed Assignments, as well as their Private Assignment if it wasn&rsquo;t completed. All uncompleted Public Assignments are left in the center of the table for players to complete the following round.&#10;&#10;Pass the Bus to the player with the fewest points from completed Assignments (not counting hidden Reward tokens), or the fewest Reward tokens in the case of a tie.&#10;Begin the next round by dealing each player 2 new Assignments from the deck.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;The game ends after 3 rounds.&#10;Players reveal their Reward tokens and total up the points on their Rewards and completed Assignments.

Each tile depicts two sandy spaces, two turtles, or sand and a turtle.&#10;&#10;On a turn, first move two of your tokens one space each or one token two spaces. Tokens move orthogonally and can land on other tokens, whether yours or the opponent's, but you can never land on a turtle.

Any tokens on this tile are returned to their respecting starting zone.&#10;&#10;Tokens can be stacked up to three high; when a token moves from the top of a stack, it moves 2-3 spaces depending on the height of the stack and can jump turtles while moving.&#10;&#10;If a token reaches the opponent's starting zone, it remains there, and the first player to cross the board with five of their tokens wins.&#10;&#10;"

To use an attack card or special move, you must pay the cost with your controller cards. The opponent can counter those attacks by blocking or using instant cards on the opponent's turn. Some attacks require power points. Accumulate power and spend it at the right time to deal the final blow and claim victory.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The battle was fought near the Bzura River, west of Warsaw, between 9 and 19 September, 1939. The first stage of the battle was a Polish counter-offensive, which was successful. However, gradually, the Germans managed to halt it, outflanking the Polish forces and counter-attacking. Eventually, as a result of the battle, Polish Pozna&#197;&#132; and Pomorze Armies that took part in the battle were destroyed. The road to Warsaw was now open to German armies marching from Silesia.&#10;&#10;This is a new edition of the &quot;Bzura 1939&quot; game that is based on the WB-95 wargaming system developed by Taktyka i Strategia. The previous editions of the game were based on different wargaming systems (e.g. W-39).&#10;&#10;"

No  score  is  tallied for  this  first  piece played.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The  next  player  then  places  their  Trominii  to  match  the numbers  butting  them  to  the  angled  end, in  any  direction.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The score  comes  from addition  of  the same touching numbers.
