Two British and two American divisions land in the Bay of Salerno defended by the full strength 16th Panzer Division, which is soon reinforced by five other German mechanized divisions. For 8 days the survival of the beachhead is in doubt, and emergency measures are taken to reinforce the beachhead with the 82nd Airborne Division. With their counter-attack stopped and the British Eighth Army approaching from the south, the Germans withdraw their left flank to avoid being trapped. However, their right flank stubbornly holds back the British from pushing north to Naples.&#10;&#10;Salerno &rsquo;43 uses the exact same map, unit, and time scales as Normandy &rsquo;44, providing an excellent way to compare these two invasions. Salerno &rsquo;43 uses a modified Normandy '44 game system. With a smaller size, the game is easier to learn and play than its predecessor.&#10;&#10;Salerno &rsquo;43 includes two scenarios: an 8-turn Invasion Scenario and a 24-turn Campaign Game. In the Campaign Game, the Allies must exit the north map edge by the end of September 1943. The Germans must delay the Allies to give time for the construction of the Gustav Line further north. The 8-turn scenario can be finished in an afternoon.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 1 day&#10;Hex: 2.3 miles / 3.8 kilometers&#10;Units: Battalion to Brigade (mostly Regiments)&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22x25.5&quot; full color map&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet of 192 9/16&quot; counters (includes 6 blank counters)&#10;One 32-page rulebook&#10;Two 4 page Player Aid Charts&#10;Two Set-up Charts&#10;One 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: Medium&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2 to 6 hours&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is for the Californians to retain Alta California while the goal of the Bear Flaggers and United States troops and sailors is to seize the soon to be Golden State. The fighting itself was not particularly bloody and involved relatively small numbers of troops. There are two major events that influence the course of the game. One is the outbreak of the Bear Flag Revolt just before the formal Declaration of War between the United States and Mexico is known of in California. The other is the rebellion of Southern California over the initial occupation by the Americans. The game is a TWO-ACT play. Several key and often-random events may play a powerful role in he final outcome of the fighting. The game will take 1-3 hours to play to completion.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;
