The players take turn moves a tent vertically, horizontally, or diagonally into a free space (without jumping or capturing). After moving, the player moves the movement marker one space clockwise, which chenges the rate of movement for the opposing player. The player who moves his pieces such that none of his tents are adjacent to each other is the winner. A nice little game from Abacus (weisse Serie).&#10;&#10;"

It was depicted as leisure activity for the characters in the television show. Later on, rules and decks of pyramid playing cards were made available commercially to fans of the show. Both are currently out of print.&#10;The game uses a 55 count deck of hexagonal cards separated into three kinds of suits and three ranks as well as a 'capstone' card which is used as a wild card. The game is played very similarly to poker. Players are dealt hands and place bets based on how strong their hand is. There is a discard between bets and players reveal their hands to determine the winner of that round.&#10;&#10;Winning hands are determined by a number of factors including suit, rank and matching sets. There are approximately fourteen different hand combinations possible in the game. There is no 'end' to the game, players merely quit at their leisure.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 55 hexagonal cards, which is divided into 3 suits: purple, green and orange. Purple ranks highest and orange ranks lowers. The deck also contains a Capstone (*).&#10;&#10;Each suit contains:&#10;- 3 First level cards&#10;- 6 Second level cards&#10;- 9 Third level cards&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;Each player is dealt 6 cards. If a player feels a better hand is possible, he may discard up to 4 cards and receive replacements from the dealer. This may only be done once per hand, much the same as &quot;Draw Poker&quot;. Players then construct their best possible pyramid and compare to the other player hands to determine the winner.&#10;Ranks of Hands&#10;A pyramid is made up of at least three cards.&#10;&#10;1. First level pyramid consist of 2 third level, and 1 second level card.&#10;&#10;2. Second level pyramid consist of 3 third level, and 2 second level card.&#10;&#10;3. Third level pyramid consist of 3 third level, 2 second level cards, and 1 first level card.&#10;&#10;4. Any of the above may be considered &quot;perfect&quot; when all of the cards used are of the same color. (&quot;Perfect&quot; pyramids rank higher than non-perfect pyramids.)&#10;&#10;5. If two or more perfect pyramids are the same level, then the highest suit would win. (NOTE: Only perfect pyramids can be ranked by suit; non-perfect pyramids are considered to have no suit.)&#10;&#10;6. If two or more pyramids are still equal, then the persons play another hand to decide the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;    ) The Capstone can be used in place of the first level card in a Perfect third level pyramid.

The general uprising never occurred, and in fact the communist's disappointment led to atrocities when they massacred hundreds of &quot;collaborators&quot; after they took control.

The designers had been playing Go, but couldn't find a balanced way to play three. So they created a grid composed of triangles laid into a hexagon shape, and designed Triplexity. Stones are played on the intersections of the grid-lines. The object of the game is to be the first player to get five or more stones in a row. Opponents' rows may be blocked, or their stones may be captured.&#10;&#10;The designers describe the game:&#10;&#10;&quot;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents' play. Every placement of a game stone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is an aggressive, every one for themselves game; defensive alliances are short lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game taking generally not more than 10-15 minutes to play.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Offense writ large should be your plan; defense will follow from a superior offense. Quick moves will facilitate play and learning of the games.&quot;&#10;&#10;From the original game manual (Copyright 1984):&#10;&#10;&quot;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a unique system that allows the playing of several different games. Presented here are the two best, TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM).  Although these two games are played with the same gemstones and on the same grid, they are significantly different, each involving different dynamics and requiring different strategies.&#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 3) and its partner game TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 6) offer something we have not seen before, a pure strategy game involving three adversaries.&#10;Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents play.  Every placement of a gemstone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities. As your skill improves you will realize more the dimensions and subtleties of this game.&#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a surprisingly fast paced game.&#10;It is an aggressive , every one for themselves game, defensive alliances are short-lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game typically taking no more than 10-15 minutes to play.  TRIPLEXITY(TM) fits in well with the fast pace of our modern society, and by its nature is an appropriate metaphor for our times.&#10;DUPLE(TM) (a game for 2) and its partner game DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) (a game for 4) are closer to the traditional strategy game, in that the third adversary, the wild card of TRIPLEXITY(TM), is missing. But the unique dynamics of the TRIPLEXITY(TM) grid remain, as well as the added dimension of playing two stones per turn.  This simple difference alters the strategy significantly.&#10;In DUPLE(TM), even more so than in TRIPLEXITY(TM), hesitating to seize control can cost you the game.  Yet going for control too soon can be disastrous.  DUPLE(TM) is a game of timing as much as it is a game of position.&#10;From the feedback we have gotten we have found some people preferred one game over the other.  We find comparisons difficult because of the unique qualities of each game.  &#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM), along with their partner games TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) as well as MONOTONY(TM) (a game for 1), cover such a range of possibilities that a truly excellent strategy game can be played with any number of people up to and including 6.  (Except 5, we have never been able to get this number to work well.  If you come up with something, we would enjoy learning how to play it!)&#10;TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM) offers what we think are two of the best strategy games to have been discovered in a very long time.  If you are only an occasional game player we think you will find this to be one of the most fun and challenging game sets you have ever owned. If you are a frequent strategy game player then this one is a must and you will find, as we have, that it is a joy to play.&#10;In keeping with the quality of the games themselves we endeavored to bring them to you in a quality form. This is not cardboard and plastic and with proper care, your game should last you many years.&#10;Have fun.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;HISTORY: In early July, the summer of 1984, John and I were playing Go - the ancient game of territory capturing and strategy of lines. While we were playing Mario came over so we decided to see if the game could be played by three. Well we played our version of Go-moku-narrabe and had a measure of success and fun. However, we were not very satisfied.  So we discussed rule modifications and also the idea of a different playing grid. We were all in agreement over this advance.&#10;After this the rules just seemed to come with the playoff this new game on our grid.&#10;The snatch and snug came as developments of our play over the next several weeks.  I remember suggesting the snatch and we were all in agreement, but thought it would have very few applications.  Then Mario said why not, since w e were able to capture a stone, be able to secure a point.  We all agreed on this advance and the game was set.  But as our skills grew we got closer to the edge and John did his blitz edge game on us.  Well, we are all wiser now.&#10;So when we got tired of sharing the world championship game among ourselves we decided to offer you these games of which we are so fond.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

The King lies dead without an heir, slain by a villainous hand. Will a leader rise up and rally the support of the people, or will the shadow of anarchy spread over the land?&#10;&#10;In Warrior Knights, each player takes on the role of a Baron vying for control of the Kingdom. Each Baron commands four faithful Nobles who lead his armies into battle. Each Baron seeks to capture cities in order to gain Influence (victory points), which is used to measure his claim to the throne. Barons may also seek to gain advantage by increasing their income, gathering Votes to use at the Assembly, or by amassing Faith, which can be used to gain a measure of control over chance events. Only through cunning strategy and careful diplomacy can a Baron hope to attain victory.&#10;&#10;Warrior Knights has a very clever mechanism.  Each player has a selection of tasks they can accomplish each turn, such as move &amp; attack, gain political strength, hire mercenaries, and gain religious faith.  Only 6 of these are done in any turn.  Each player selects 2 tasks for each 1/3 of the game turn.  The cards of all the players are then shuffled together, so the players know only the two tasks they will perform in each 1/3 of the game turn, but not the order they will be played.&#10;&#10;In addition, the game has four special phases that are triggered based on how frequently players are choosing a particular task.  Collecting taxes individually, once done often enough, will trigger a taxation phase.  Players collecting political power trigger a session of Parliament.  When enough players want to hire mercenaries there is an auction for their services.  The flip side is that the more mercenaries that are hired the more often they want to be paid in the wages phase.&#10;&#10;The mixing of these two clever mechanisms, choosing tasks but performing them in a random order and triggering the 4 special phases at somewhat unpredictable times makes for a tense game.   Players can often be caught short of cash if wages are demanded more frequently than taxes are collected.  If the other players all collect political influence a Parliament might be called when one or two players have only a single vote.  These elements of variable turn orders and variable phases give the game a highly addictive quality.&#10;&#10;"

Players take turns moving one piece per turn, starting with the Black player.  All pieces move in a straight line through unoccupied spaces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  Zin pieces may end their turn on top of Wall pieces.  The numbers on standard Zin pieces determine the maximum number of spaces that they may move.  Rogue Zins can move up to three spaces and have some special powers which make them more flexible than standard Zins.  Walls move only one space per turn, and only if they are unoccupied.&#10;&#10;Pieces are captured by being landed on by an opponent's piece.  Regular Zins may only capture opponents on the same or a lower plane (i.e. they can't capture an opponent on a wall if they are on the surface of the board).  Walls may be either captured or landed upon at the player's discretion.  They may also be promoted to other types of pieces of they reach the opponent's side of the board.
