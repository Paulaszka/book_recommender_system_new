This goal is achieved by gathering magical items that are most compatible with their character.&#10;&#10;At the start, each player is given a secret Wizard card (each with its SpellName and element type) and a hand of cards.  A Magic Item card is then revealed, starting off a round of fighting for it.  Taking turns, the players draw a card from the common deck and play, keep or discard it.  Through these cards, the players deploy heroes and monsters to fight, boost them up with equipment and spells, and kill off certain types of units.  The player with the highest value from his cards wins the Magic Item.  Played cards are discarded, and the next round begins by revealing another Magic Item.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cards in the deck have been drawn.  The players reveal their wizards and tally the points for their artifacts' affinity with their wizard's element type.  The player with the highest score is the winner.  During the game, each player has one chance to guess another player's element type.  If the guess is correct, the target cannot win the game at the end even if he or she has the most points.&#10;&#10;"
