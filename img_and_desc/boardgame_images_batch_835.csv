The player&rsquo;s individual aircraft, each represented by a stickered block, must confront the mighty &ldquo;combat box&rdquo; formation of the United States Army Air Force, a deadly terrain of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. Like its counterpart, Skies Above the Reich, the game is a broad strokes depiction that presents the arc of the desperate air war. Stretching from late 1942 to early 1945, Storm Above the Reich follows that trajectory in a series of missions strung together to make a campaign. Each mission will take a half hour or more to play, while a campaign can last anywhere between 6 to 60 missions.&#10;&#10;Stand-Alone and an Expansion: &quot;Storm Above the Reich&quot; is a stand-alone game; you don&rsquo;t need &quot;Skies Above the Reich&quot; to play. However, it can also serve as an expansion for that game. Storm uses the same rules as Skies, and components in one game transfer seamlessly to the other. Combined, Storm and Skies present eight formation maps, six pursuit maps, B-17s and B-24s. In Storm, you get an oversized staffel of 18 Fw190s, with the option of augmenting it into a Sturmbocke staffel. In Skies, you get a staffel of Bf109s, and with the games combined, the staffels can also be combined.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Simple rules lead to beautiful complexities in this abstract area control tile placement card game. It's smart, fun, approachable and addictive.&#10;&#10;Card placement and area control is all resolved orthogonally to other cards. So up, down, left and right only. Players try to control more of the board through influence from the base cards they play on each turn. Then they check up, down, left and right of the base they place to see what player (if any) has a majority of base cards around it. If no one has more bases than anyone else around it, that square is uncontrolled, and any flag there is returned to its owner, which they can again either as a base or a flag as required.&#10;&#10;This makes for a dynamic board that gets built out into a square as play continues (6x6 for 2 players, 7x7 for 3 players, or 8x8 for 4 players). Once the boundaries are established, play continues until all the board is filled. The winner is the player who has the most cards of their color on the board. If there's a tie, the player with the largest &quot;island&quot; of their color cards touching is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description of the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Inspired by the greats, like UNO, Skip-bo, Phase 10, and Rack-O.&#10;&#10;Players control time to play all of their cards before their opponents!&#10;&#10;Components: 1 travel case/game board, 1 instruction sheet, 168 cards, consisting of 12 each #1-#12 (clock cards), 18 n (wild) cards, and 6 Reverse time cards.&#10;&#10;Reverse time cards: These cards dictate the counting order of the game. The first time they are played, they are played face up to change the direction to counterclockwise (backward) counting direction. The second time they are played face down to indicate clockwise direction. They are played to the side of the time zones, separate from the counting piles.&#10;&#10;Objective: Play all of the cards in your countdown deck before your opponent! The game ends when a player has accumulated 365 points, and then the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;&#10;     Deal 12 cards face down to each player, each player flips their top card over and places it on top of their cards to create the countdown pile.&#10;     Reveal 4 cards face up in the 4 time zones in the center.

They may use cards from their countdown pile, hand, or discards to count the hours of the clock in the time zone, according to the direction (forwards or backwards) in the directional area.&#10;&#10;Counting in Tempus is cyclical, like a clock. Players will count 11-12-1 in forwards direction, and 1-12-11 in backwards direction.&#10;&#10;If a player can play all 5 cards from their hand in a single turn, they can draw 5 more cards and continue playing&#10;&#10;All n cards must be covered by the next clock card in the sequence before that players turn is over. If it cannot be covered, it is removed from the time zone and placed at the bottom of their countdown deck.&#10;&#10;A player MUST count at least one card in the Time Zone from their countdown pile, hand, or discard per turn. They must draw cards into their hands until they can. If a player has more than 5 cards after discarding, they must place the excess cards at the bottom of their countdown pile.&#10;&#10;A player ends their turn by discarding 1 card into one of their four discard piles. Cards may be stacked, but only the current top card of each discard pile is playable. Any remaining cards in a players hand carries over to their next turn, where they will draw until they have 5 again.&#10;&#10;Play continues to the left until one player has used all of the cards in their countdown pile. All other players add up their cards remaining in their countdown piles and add it to their score.

The artwork in the gameboard portion is highly detailed, with images of furniture, seamen at work and varied ship's stores, but in a plain red ink against a white background.&#10;&#10;There are six playing pieces, highly detailed human figures in different uniforms and dress, printed on cardboard and standing in coloured wooden disks.&#10;&#10;Both the cover illustration and the board take considerable artistic liberties with technical details. The ship on the cover looks very much like the 1898-commissioned pre-dreadnought battleship Kaiser Wilhelm III, but has an extra funnel and is missing a side turret. The ship on the board has the correct two funnels, but is missing the barbette gun beside the main forward turret as well as one of the three side turrets, and has no rear turret. The ships fly non-existent and therefore neutral flags of horizontal stripes, but are red-yellow-blue on the cover and red-blue-yellow on the board.&#10;&#10;The cover art is signed with the initials SR, while the board art is unsigned, which may explain the differences in detail.

Once those resources are extracted, the Beta Bots' task is to deliver them to the corporation's ships.&#10;&#10;It won't be a piece of cake. To start with, the exoplanet is unstable, so the Beta Bots will have to adapt to a constantly changing environment.  On top of that, each corporation ship requires different resources, and each payload delivery requires perfect timing &amp; alignment with the orbiting trajectory of the matching ship. And last, but not least, the rival corporation Cylindroids INC&reg; has sent its own bots to snatch resources and interfere with your bots.&#10;&#10;But do not fret! Beta Bots can count on Alpha Bot&rsquo;s help, a support robot with a (very) short-tempered AI. Alpha Bot will unlock new places to mine, give the Beta Bots more actions and generally make their life easier...but keep an eye on those pesky Cylindroid bots, since they won't pass up the opportunity to damage your guardian!&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;Mechanical overview:&#10;&#10;The game is organized in rounds. In each round, an event takes place (which might involve trouble for the Beta Bots!) and the players will program actions to interact with the planet's resource-laden chambers, with enemies, with Alpha Bot, or with each other. Actions are chosen in secret and players commit to them before any are revealed. The stress level of each bot determines the turn order as well as its possible resource deliveries. Then players take turns to reveal their programmed actions, and execute them.&#10;&#10;Each player has their own robot's blueprint, where they store resources using multiple containers of limited size. Those resources can be delivered to the passing ships, or they can be transformed or spent to enhance the robot's capabilities.&#10;&#10;During the adventure, the autonomous Alpha Bot will advance through the planet's chambers until it reaches the surface. Players can interact with Alpha Bot to obtain advantages or to steer it out of harm's way, since it is vulnerable to enemy attacks and the planet's adversities.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, there's a maintenance step that includes the activation of enemy robots (Cylindroids). They can move, attack, or occupy resource chambers. Additionally, players will receive benefits or penalties (stress) according to their distance to Alpha Bot.&#10;&#10;The game ends when Alpha Bot reaches the last chamber. The players tally the victory points, which can be earned in different ways: Through successful resource deliveries, by upgrades on their robot, by fulfilling other objectives, etc. Then, each player's victory points is reduced by the amount of stress they incurred during gameplay, and the player with most remaining points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
