However, variant rules are provided in which the stones are allocated at the start of the game, and there are also alternative scoring methods.&#10;&#10;In addition to the Kwaz game itself, there are two puzzles given, three solitaire games (Doubletz, X Squared, and Super X), as well as a completely different two-player game which does not use the cards. In this game, called Perziztence, the players move and jump stones in an attempt to occupy three of the corners of the board.&#10;&#10;"

Like Chess, Martian Chess is turn based, and played on a chessboard.  In both games, players move and capture individual pieces, and each type of piece has distinct moving rules.&#10;&#10;However, Martian Chess differs from Chess in critical ways:&#10;&#10;     Piece ownership is determined not by color but by location.&#10;     Instead of capturing a specific piece, winning is determined by points, making it possible to force the end of the game and still win with no pieces left in that player's control.&#10;     Lastly, Martian Chess easily supports 4 players as well as two, and can also be played with 3, 5 or 6 players if you use geomorphic chessboard sections; see this photo for an example.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The aim of the game is to be the first player to return both pieces to their starting positions, moving one pawn round clockwise, and the other anti-clockwise.&#10;&#10;It is a diceless game: players are in control of their own movement. Any unoccupied space can be reached as long as, and here&rsquo;s the twist, the player has enough &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; to reach that square. Remember those chips? For each square traveled, one chip has to be handed in. The landing space determines which colour those chips should be. Used chips are then put through the slots of the containers in the middle, spread between them at will. At the start of the game, each player only has enough chips to get one pawn round the board. To get both pieces round additional fuel need to be bought. During your turn, you can buy the hidden contents of one of the containers by discarding one of your three sticks.

Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

You must move your ball in a straight line (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as follows: (1) the total of both dice (2) the number on either die (3) the difference between the two dice.&#10;&#10;Playing from a sand trap has a potential penalty.

The next day, a reinforced Union army counter-attacked and drove the CSA line back in confusion and retreat. A CSA victory might have ruined the career of General Ulysses S. Grant. Instead, the battle ended with a Union victory, the death of Johnston, and the eventual demise of Confederate hopes in the West. Days 1 and 2 can be played separately or together.&#10;&#10;Shiloh was initially developed from the Gettysburg: Badges of Courage game system. However, the game mechanics have been completely overhauled. The map is divided into large areas and combat is resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division or corps. The game plays smoothly and quickly; each player gets to play one day on offense and one day on defense for a great gaming experience. Game time is 2-4 hours for both days of Shiloh.&#10;&#10;"

The game combines detailed individualized players cards for every player position with specific offensive and defensive play calls to generate action.&#10;&#10;Here is a brief description of play from the manufacturer's web-site:&#10;&#10;First, let&rsquo;s set the scene. It&rsquo;s the first round of the playoffs, with Miami hosting New England. Miami&rsquo;s got the ball on the New England 37 yard line with 4:23 to go in the fourth quarter. They&rsquo;re down by a touchdown.&#10;&#10;The Miami coach selects a passing play, &ldquo;F1 Cross&rdquo; (F1 is the flanker, and he&rsquo;s running a crossing pattern over the middle of the field).&#10;&#10;The play card is essentially a 3&rdquo; x 5&rdquo; card filled with information about the ensuing play. The larger letters (s, T, G, C, Q, etc.) represent offensive players. The boxes and ovals represent defensive zones which may or may not be occupied by one or more defensive players. The lines represent the routes each of the offensive players takes after the snap. The red line represents the route taken by the intended receiver. Blue lines represent secondary receivers, while black lines represent the motion taken by blockers.&#10;&#10;The smaller letters are the player ratings, which are followed by a number or range of numbers, which correspond to a 20-sided (d20) die.&#10;&#10;So let&rsquo;s roll the dice and see what happens&hellip;&#10;&#10;20 sided die = 2 &#10;12 sided die = 6&#10;2 six sided die roll = 1+3 = 4&#10;&#10;The d20 roll (2) tells us what the matchup is. In this case, the left guard is matched up against the defender in the zone opposite him (in this case, the right defensive tackle).&#10;&#10;Here are the two players involved on the play:&#10;&#10;J. Buckley [G - Miami 97]&#10;Hen. Thomas [DT - New England 97]&#10;&#10;The offensive player&rsquo;s &ldquo;D&rdquo; rating (pass blocking) is now compared to the &ldquo;B&rdquo; rating (pass rush) of the defensive player&rsquo;s. These two ratings are subtracted (6 &ndash; 4 = 2) and compared to the d10 (in this case, a 6 was rolled). Since 6 is larger than 2, the defensive player wins the matchup.&#10;&#10;Now, the two d6 are added together (1 + 3 = 4). Since Thomas won the matchup, we look under his &ldquo;B&rdquo; column across from &ldquo;4&rdquo; and find the result code of &ldquo;47&rdquo;. This is a sack! (Result codes are listed on the field&hellip;there are approximately 90 of them.)&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s it! All other plays are completed in a similar fashion.&#10;&#10;"
