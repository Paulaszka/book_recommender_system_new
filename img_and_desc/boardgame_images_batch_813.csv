A card is set aside, such as the rear half of the bulldog, shares and plays according to the known rules of &quot;Black Peter&quot;. Matching front and rear halves can be stored. Whoever keeps the head of the bulldog as the last card, gets the name of the animal.&#10;2. Players are dealt with the cards that are placed face up on the table. The player sitting to the left of the dealer may now begin to trade. He asks a player who has an animal half that he wants to own, whether he gives it to him, and which card he wants instead of him. The interviewee is now allowed to trade with another player. If someone does not want to trade anymore, because he can not get anything suitable, his left neighbor can continue. It is exchanged until nobody wants to exchange more. The aim of the game is not to collect the animal halves, but to invent as fantastic as possible new species of animals. At the end it will be decided who has put together the most beautiful animal and which name it should receive.&#10;3. Of course, you can also set up new adventurous species on your own. Bull Medar and Naspferd, Papafant and Warzengei, Antibarsch and Nilguruh, and many others. By the way, 484 different animal combinations are possible.&#10;&#10;"

The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.&#10;&#10;But, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council's demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead.

With some sketchy building permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone. However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: As soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there.

First, each player is dealt an equal number of Money Cards, of which there are four denominations. Then a deck of Item Cards is placed in the middle of the table, within everyone's reach. Points Tokens, Priority Tokens and the Dealer Token are placed near the Item Deck as well.&#10;&#10;Each round consists of four Phases:&#10;&#10;1. Evaluation Phase&#10;A number of Item Cards equal to the number of players are turned over. During this phase players assess the value of the cards relative to how it can earn points for their personal set of Item Cards, called the Cabinet.&#10;&#10;2. Auction Phase (auction mechanic)&#10;During the Auction Phase, players will use their Money Cards to make bids to acquire one Item Card for their Cabinet. However, in this style of auction, players don't declare a bid on a specific Item Card, rather they bid to win the highest 'Priority' among their competitors. Priority is the order in which each player chooses an Item Card in the next Phase. This means that a player cannot be entirely certain what card their opponents are trying to obtain.&#10;&#10;Starting with the Dealer of that round, each player takes a turn to either bid or pass. If they bid, then they will place an amount of money greater than the last player's bid on the table.&#10;&#10;If the player instead chooses to pass, they may not participate for the rest of that round's auction.&#10;&#10;Passing is actually what determines Priority for the round: the first player to pass in the Auction Phase will be the last player to choose an Item Card during the Curation Phase. The second player to pass will be the second last to choose a card, and so forth. Priority tokens help keep track of this order.&#10;&#10;When all of the players but one have passed, the Round will transition to the Curation Phase.&#10;&#10;3. Curation (Tile Mechanic)&#10;In the Curation Phase, each player will choose one of the Item Cards in order of Priority, as determined in the Auction Phase. When all of the players have chosen a card, they will add it to their Cabinet by placing it on either the leftmost or rightmost end of the series (in the case of the first round, they will simply place the card in front of them). Item Cards are never placed above, below other cards in the Cabinet. Furthermore, once placed in the set, cards may not be moved or rearranged in any way.&#10;&#10;In order to earn points, a newly placed Item Card must share one or more Category icons with its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category between adjoining cards, one point is earned.&#10;&#10;4. Appraisal Phase&#10;In the Appraisal Phase, players will count the number of categories shared between the newly added Item Card and its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category, a point is earned; the player will then take an appropriate number of Point Tokens and place them between the two cards to track score.&#10;&#10;After the Appraisal Phase has ended a new round begins (unless it was the seventh round, see below). The player that won the highest Priority in the last round becomes the Dealer for the new round (and receives the Dealer Token).&#10;&#10;After the seventh round the game ends, and players add up all of the Point Tokens in their Cabinet. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"

This simple game was designed for postal play (play-by-mail) and cannot be converted to face-to-face play because turns require one week of real time.  At least two players are needed, though the game may facilitate any number of players (8 players is considered optimum).  At the start of the game, one player is selected as the &quot;investment manager&quot; and this player will execute all of the turns and make a report of results (including their own).  The game runs for a number of weeks (turns) determined at the start of play.&#10;&#10;The game is run by selecting any newspaper published at least once a week that carries at least some financial news and stock listings (the author suggests the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as appropriate).  All players begin with a &pound;100,000 loan taken at interest.  Players submit one turn per week in writing, containing a buy/sell order or orders.  Players may buy or sell any number of shares they can afford in any stock, bond, or security that is routinely reported in the selected newspaper.  Players may also repay a loan, in whole or in part, if desired.&#10;&#10;The &quot;investment manager&quot; player calculates a trade expense using a standard (given) formula depending on the type of security, and then adjusts the player's portfolio as appropriate.  On the weekly mark, the newspaper issue of that day is used to determine the net value of all player holdings (including appreciation, depreciation, and dividends).  The loan rate for outstanding loans is deducted, and players that are &quot;in the hole&quot; are forced to take overdrafts at higher loan rates (loan interest rates are fixed by the rules).  The &quot;investment manager&quot; player then makes a report to all players.&#10;&#10;After the determined number of week (turns) has elapsed, all shares in any security are sold, all costs are calculated and deducted, all loans are repaid (if possible), and a final valuation is made for all players.  The player with the highest monetary value is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

On your turn, you will be tracking down a variety of the universe's most notorious fugitives.&#10;&#10;You start with a hand size of 4 cards, each representing the fugitives you are currently tracking. On each turn, all players will secretly select one fugitive to catch. Once all players have chosen a fugitive, the fugitives are revealed and placed in each player's Temporary Holding Cell aboard their ships. Then, in turn order, starting with the 1st player, each player has the opportunity to activate the Special Action that is awarded for the fugitive&rsquo;s capture.&#10;&#10;After all actions have been taken, the fugitives are then moved from the players&rsquo; Temporary Holding Cells to their ships&rsquo; Brigs.

This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each region of the board contains five areas, each one of five different types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving, if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty areas, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends, and each scoring will either gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type in which scoring occurred and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, then players reveal their colors to find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;"

In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:&#10;&#10;Buy new cards from the common display&#10;Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)&#10;Train/Educate your people&#10;Build/found cities&#10;Take money&#10;To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.&#10;&#10;It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.&#10;&#10;Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols.

Points start at 0 and will evolve throughout the game. While players get ready to play, a Hero or Heroine card is laid down on the table &ndash; this card becomes the object of affection for all players. Each of these Hero or Heroine cards have attribute points, and  once these points are met by a player, he or she can play the Happy Ending card and win the game.&#10;&#10;Once players decide which Hero or Heroine will be on the table as the goal of the game, the remaining Hero and Heroine cards are put aside and no longer a part of the game.&#10;Action Cards, Actor Cards, Song Cards and Counter Attack Cards are shuffled and SIX CARDS are then distributed to each player, and cannot be displayed to anyone.  &#10;The remaining cards become the game deck and will be put face down on the table. This is the deck players will draw cards from in order to advance in the game.  &#10;During his turn, a player can play any card he has in hands. His turn will finish when the player discards all the cards he wishes from his hand to the &lsquo;discard deck&rsquo; next to the original &lsquo;playing deck&rsquo;. Cards will be face up on the &lsquo;dicard deck&rsquo;. &#10;The player can also finish his turn by simply choosing to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; without discarding any cards during his turn. But the player cannot end his turn with more than 3 cards in his hand, if a player has more than 3 cards in hand at the end of his turn he must choose a remaining card to be discarded. &#10;All the cards used during a turn (i.e.: Actor Cards, Song Cards, Counter Attack Cards) will be discarded to the &lsquo;discard deck&rsquo; as well. &#10;After all players complete their turns, the first player will draw as many cards as necessary from the playing deck until that player has 6 cards in hand&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player controls a side or a Front in this multifaceted game, seeking to defeat the opponent by winning the most Battlefield cards before the end of play. There are no dice, tokens, counters or anything but cards in this game.&#10;&#10;Force and Unit Cards&#10;&#10;These cards represent military forces of various nations in the war. The Basic Game contains a selection of Axis and Allied divisions and corps and armies for the Soviet.  An illustration shows the type of troops, or a typical combat action, a unit insignia, or other distinctive element. The card often has brief comments on the actual unit. It will show a combat value.  Certain unit types have special abilities in the game.  In general, battles will be resolved based on the CVs of the Army Cards on both sides of the action. The player draws cards from a pile called the Mobilization Deck, holds them in her/his hand, and then deploys them to locations on the tabletop.  ,.&#10;&#10;Support Cards&#10;&#10;These cards represent important Leaders in the war, key command Headquarters, and Air Force units. Support cards by themselves have no Combat Value. Instead, they add their printed CV to other Army Cards present with them. This support value is shown by brackets printed around the card&rsquo;s CV. If alone on a Battlefield when the opponent attacks, Support Cards&mdash;excepting Air Force units&mdash;are eliminated. Air Force unit cards immediately fly to another Battlefield on the same Front where friendly cards are present. If unable to meet that condition, Air Force cards are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Special Cards&#10;&#10;Special Cards come in many varieties and have particular functions. The capture of Battlefield Cards is the player&rsquo;s main goal in the game. Battlefield Cards provide locations for combat, create a timeline for the war, and award Victory Points to the player who captures them. They are specific to one of three geographic Fronts in the game.  Event Cards add to the play and can upset the best of plans; they are self-explanatory. Fuel Cards represent economic resources and shape the actions the player can conduct in his turn. Battle Condition Cards set characteristics for a fight in progress.&#10;&#10;The Board&#10;&#10;The Board can be a game mat or any tabletop as a geographic space divided into three main areas called Fronts. The Fronts occupy the center of the space between the players and collectively are termed the Combat Zone. At each player&rsquo;s edge of the table, she/he will require three spaces. One of these is for the player&rsquo;s Mobilization Deck, which consists of all unplayed cards. One is the Discard Pile of cards that have been expended. The third is for the player&rsquo;s Strategic Reserve, which comprises cards the player has put into play but not yet deployed to a specific Battlefield.&#10;&#10;"

Each player has 2 cards face down in front of them that they are not allowed to look at. One card is placed in the middle of the play area.&#10;&#10;INTERROGATION&#10;The First player will peek at 1 card and must swap 1 of the 2 cards in front of the player they just &quot;interrogated&quot; (either swapping the card they just looked at or the other card in the player's possession).&#10;OR they may peek at the card in the middle of play and swap it with ANY card.&#10;DISCLOSURE&#10;After each player has Interrogated, the first player must flip over 1 card so that it is face-up.&#10;&#10;The first player card is passed to the left and play continues.&#10;&#10;END GAME: The game ends when one of the players is unable to make a legal move.&#10;&#10;SCORING: Each player will add their face-up card point values (and the value of the blackmail card face-up or face-down) The highest point total wins.

El Chapo&rsquo;s team is constantly moving around inside Mexico trying to evade the law, but the cartel leader has certain tastes and expectations. He&rsquo;s not just willing to sit inside a hole somewhere and is interested in leading an active, social lifestyle. Law enforcement has to use that against him.&#10;&#10;The key to the game is the facilitator. It&rsquo;s their responsibility to keep the game moving by interpreting the rules and feeding them to players on the fly. But in Kingpin, the facilitator also plays the role of referee.

In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.&#10;&#10;Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.&#10;&#10;Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &quot;on offer&quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"
