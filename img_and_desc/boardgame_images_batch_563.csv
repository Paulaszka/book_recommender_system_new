Each player becomes a producer of the movie, or hire the talent, we will increase the influence in the industry by creating a slush fund or been successful in investing, or making a movie variety. Rivals and won the &quot;psychological warfare&quot;, it becomes &quot;mastermind&quot; who do you think true...&#10;&#10;Game description from user:&#10;&#10;&quot;Film Fixer&quot; is a 3-4 player card game based on the theme of producing movies in the film industry. Although this game was made in Japan, the company has made it bilingual (although a few of the translations are a little strange).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a new talent card and 8 coins. The players use coins to purchase (contract) &quot;talent&quot; and send the talent to &quot;movies&quot; to earn money and victory points.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;4  - Newcomer Cards&#10;36 - Money Cards (9x 6 coins, 12x 3 coins, 15x 1 coins)&#10;37 - Movie Cards (15/Talent cards, 11/QE Film cards, 11/CP Film cards)&#10;1  - The End Card&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of 6 phases:&#10;&#10;1 - Investment&#10;2 - Change&#10;3 - Contracting&#10;4 - Shooting&#10;5 - Profit&#10;6 - Replenishing&#10;&#10;The instructions provided are a little confusing at first, but I'll do my best to try and summarize them.&#10;&#10;The movie cards (talent and film cards) are shuffled, the END card is placed two from the bottom, and 5 cards are dealt into the play area.&#10;&#10;1 - In the investment phase, the non-active players can invest money in what they think the active player will do. Money cards each have one of three logos on them: Yukidama Agency Corp. (for all talent cards [YA]), Qvinta Essentia Entertainment Inc. [QP] and Cosaic Pictures Inc. [CP] (the two movie companies). The invested money is placed face down until phase 5, where the non-active players find out which companies the active player has played.&#10;&#10;2 - In the change phase, the active player can choose to pay one coin to switch out one movie card with a new one. They can do this as many times as they like as long as they have the money to do so. They do not receive change from this transaction.&#10;&#10;3 - In the contracting phase, the active player can purchase &quot;talent&quot; which is then placed face up in front of them. Talent cards often have abilities that affect gameplay. Players CAN receive change from this transaction in this phase.&#10;&#10;4 - In the shooting phase, the active player sends talent (this includes their newest &quot;talent&quot; card) to any film cards in the play area. They can send multiple talent cards to work on different films as long as those films are being produced by the same company (you can't send one talent card to CP and one to QE in the same turn, for example). You can also send multiple talent cards to the same film (they act as co-stars). The active player collects money and the film card (film cards go into the victory point pile). If the sent talent card has a star symbol on it, it is discarded.&#10;&#10;5 - In the profit phase, the non-active players collect their rewards, if any, for investing wisely. For example: if Player B decides to invest a &quot;one coin&quot; card with the CP logo on it and the active Player A sends talent to a CP film, then player B is rewarded: player B can either put the invested one coin card into their VP pile or upgrade this coin card to the next higher value coin card. If player B invested in the wrong company, that invested coin card is discarded.&#10;&#10;6 - In the replenish phase, new movie cards are dealt into the play area until there are 5 cards again. It is now the investment phase again with the next player in turn order taking the active player role.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once the END card is dealt, the game ends after the NEXT player's turn. Once finished, each player counts their Victory Points. The player with the most VPs is the winner. In case of a tie, the player who made the most movies wins.&#10;&#10;"

Storm Over Europe uses a card-driven system for activation, with each side getting varying amounts of cards each turn. The cards generally allow special moves or combinations that break the standard rules of the game, or provide events that shape the strategic outlook.&#10;&#10;Players choose their hand each turn from a pool of sixteen Operations cards. Special Strategic cards are added to the pool once a turn from the third turn on; these bring new countries into the war, allow special tactics like poison gas, or provide game-turning events like the Russian Revolution.&#10;&#10;The rules are only seven pages, and the game is simple and fast enough to play in a short evening.&#10;&#10;"

Play is divided into two Phases: In Phase I, Creators alternate playing Tiled Cards to create a map, and use octagonal Origin Points to set where their Creations spawn from. In Phase II, Body &amp; Soul Cards are paired together to make 3 Creations per team. After their Creator describes them, pawns are placed on the map to represent them. As pawns are moved around the map, they will come into conflict with Rival Creations. Conflict is resolved by rolling 1 to 3 six-sided dice. A continually exchanged Event Card assigned to each Creation provides aid or presents challenges as the game unfolds, typically by modifying the number of dice rolled.&#10;&#10;By rolling successfully, Creations will lose Heart. When Heart is reduced to zero, the Creations is removed from the map. Origin Points have no Heart and are removed from the map when rolled against successfully, but are much harder to succeed against.

Should two or more people roll the highest number than they must roll off until someone has rolled higher.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn you must do the following.&#10;1.    Draw a card from the draw pile.&#10;2.    Use a power card, place a character card in play, or use a character card power.&#10;3.    Discard cards from your hand until you have only five left.&#10;&#10;Power Cards&#10;Most power cards may only be used on your turn. When you play a power card you immediately do whatever it says, then discard it. Well&hellip; not immediately, but before you do anything else game related. So you could eat a sandwich or something.&#10;&#10;Some power cards may be used at other times, which is indicated on the card itself. When in doubt, the card is right.&#10;&#10;Character Cards&#10;Character cards may be placed in front of you during your turn instead of using a power card or a character power. Place the character card in front of you and leave it there until something tells you to place it someplace else. This is now considered to be an &ldquo;in play&rdquo; character card. You may not use the Character Card Power the turn you place a character card in play. You may only have three character cards in play at a time. If you place a fourth you must discard one.&#10;&#10;Character Card Powers&#10;Instead of placing a character card or using a power card you may use the power on one of your &ldquo;in play&rdquo; character cards. This power works just like a power card, except you do not need to discard the character card to use it.&#10;&#10;Note, some character cards have passive effects that do not require you to use them on your turn.

Players go head-to-head in this fighting-strategy game with deck-building aspects. Players choose their favorite mech to battle it out, with each mech offering a different loadout of cards to start the game and unique powers.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players play a card face-down. When both players have chosen a card, they reveal them. Cards resolve based on their speed if they haven't been interrupted. Weapons deal damage and interrupt the enemy, while defending avoids weapon hits. Upgrading offers you additional cards to add to your arsenal but is vulnerable to being interrupted. Lastly, recharge reloads spent cards.&#10;&#10;As cards are played, they go to their owner's cool-down pile, where they remain until they're reloaded. As players take damage, the armor on their mech is destroyed. When enough armor is destroyed, an armor core becomes vulnerable and can be destroyed to stun that mech for the next turn. The game ends when a mech's armor is completely destroyed down to the last core.&#10;&#10;"
