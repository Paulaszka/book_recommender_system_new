Wigan borough place names have been excluded presumably because it upsets the symmetry of the board.&#10;As well as the board, the games use counters, different colour skittle pieces.  Some of the games use a die and/or cards.&#10;The rules to each game are brief (one A5 sheet or less) and simple.  They have varying degrees of tactical scope.  Some are race games but most are abstract strategies.  The main appeal is the use of local names, assuming that the player is 'local'.&#10;&#10;Some of the games use a random element in the piece set up (by drawing place name cards), some of the games use a random element in the movement allowance.  Only one game, Werneth, has no random element.&#10;&#10;The limits in the number of players for each game seems to be more a function of the pieces issued rather than game balance.  There would seem to be scope for adding players if extra pieces were drafted in from another game.&#10;&#10;ANCOATS (2-6 players) is a movement game.  Ability to move depends on the colour of the card drawn, the colour of the space the piece is on and the colour it is moving to.  The winner is the first player to land on the three places determined by a random selection of three cards at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;BURNAGE (2-6 players) a movement game collecting cards at each space visited, or challenging other players for the cards they have collected.  The winner being the first to collect a predetermined number of cards.&#10;&#10;In OFFERTON (2 players) the start location of pieces is randomised by cards.  After that, distance of movement is determined by the points on each space.  The winner is the fist player to get their six counters in a contiguous line.&#10;&#10;PRESTOLEE (2-5 players) is a die movement game.  The winner is the first player to move to all 16 spaces of the player's colour, collecting a card at each location space.&#10;&#10;RUSHOLME (2-6 players) has randomized set up, but movement is then dictated by the points and colours of each space.  The winner is the first to collect a specified number of counters distributed around the board.&#10;&#10;SEEDLEY (2-4 players) is a card game which uses the board for reference.  A player can only pick up a place name card off the discard pile, if they are discarding an adjacent place name.&#10;&#10;WERNETH (2 players) Players take it in turns to place a counter on the board, until there are 12 in total.  They then place their coloured skittle on the board.  They then take it in turns to move the their skittle according to the points on the space, restrictions on combinations of the colour of the current space, the space it is moving to, the colour of the skittle, or the presence of a counter or opponent's skittle.  The loser is the first player who cannot make a legal move on their turn.&#10;&#10;"

The simplest configuration therefore resembles a mini Stone Henge (hence the name).&#10;&#10;The space in between can be empty or occupied by a piece of either color.&#10;&#10;One player is attempting to connect the top and bottom of the board and the other player the left and right edges.

(For a non-trivial game, we should start with at least three heaps.) In &quot;standard play&quot;, the player who cannot make a move on his turn (because no objects remain) is the loser. A very general and far-reaching theory of such games is developed in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.&#10;&#10;In the commercial version pictured, the players take turns removing 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs together in a row. It would appear from the picture that &quot;rows&quot; can run in any direction, which means that the &quot;heaps&quot; intersect. This is not what most people know as Nim. Also, according to the original description, in this version the loser is the player who has to remove the last peg. This is so-called &quot;misere play&quot;, rather than the standard winning condition. Many combinatorial games allow mis&egrave;re play as a variation.&#10;&#10;Nim is solved, which means that from any initial configuration, one can readily determine whether the next player or the previous player has a winning strategy, and identify a good next move in the former case. For Nim, this can be determined surprisingly readily no matter the size of the heaps, but you're not going to get the secret from me.&#10;&#10;As most who would be interested in Nim know the solution, there isn't much of a game here. But Nim plays a central role in the theory of combinatorial games, as any two-player finite impartial game is in some sense Nim in disguise: any position in such a game corresponds to a unique Nim-heap, and one can play the disguised game perfectly by making the moves that correspond to winning moves in Nim. Sprouts is one example. This however does not mean that Sprouts itself is solved, as the &quot;disguise&quot; is only partially revealed.&#10;&#10;"

Also look Out For Refuge Squares, Avoid Capture, Closed Circuit TV, Alarms and the Baroom Card!!&#10;&#10;This Star Trek Game is a board game for two to six players produced in 1975 by Palitoy for the UK game market. This game is TOS-based, and was advertised as &quot;Taken from the popular BBC TV Series Star Trek&quot;. Much of the game's artwork seems to have been done by &ndash; or at least, influenced by &ndash; the artists who worked on the Gold Key Star Trek comic. Players play crewmembers of the Enterprise assigned to obtain alien crystals from two planets that can be used to destroy a nearby Klingon warship, while avoiding capture by either the Klingons or the indigenous creatures on either planet.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The object of the game is to land on two planets &ndash; the &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Ice Planet&quot; &ndash; to retrieve a sample of &quot;Zithium&quot; and &quot;Beton&quot; (respectively) to use against the Klingons and destroy their ship.&#10;As crewmembers of the Enterprise, you have been assigned to obtain a crystal of each substance from their respective plantes, while avoiding a giant alien spider (which protects the crystals on the Planet of Fire) and an amorphous blob called a Blurg (who protects the crystals on the Ice Planet).&#10;&#10;Each player starts in the Enterprise transporter room and tries to roll the number of the transporter pad to which they are assigned to &quot;beam down&quot; to one of the planets. (If they cannot do this within three rolls, they &quot;beam down&quot; automatically.) The player then traverses the game path on the planet to try and reach the cavern containing the crystals at the path's end. Players can obtain help from Kirk or Spock by landing on the space with their picture. They can also be captured if landed on by either creature or a Klingon (spaces on the path allow either the creatures to move or the Klingons to beam down to the planets), but by the player having Kirk and/or Spock with them, the player can have their &quot;senior officer&quot; &quot;stun&quot; their attacker and continue play.&#10;&#10;Once a player obtains the crystal from one planet, they return to the Enterprise and go through &quot;decontamination&quot; (moving along the red and white path near the transporter room). They then return to the transporter (via the yellow and green path) and attempt to &quot;beam down&quot; to the other planet and get the second crystal. They then return to the Enterprise and undergo &quot;decontamination&quot; again before proceeding to the Enterprise's &quot;airlock&quot; and attempting to board the Klingon ship. From their, the player must enter the Klingon bridge, plant the crystals, and beam back to the Enterprise and undergo &quot;decontamination&quot; a third time before landing on the &quot;Detonator&quot; space and playing the &quot;Baroom&quot; card on the Klingon ship, thus destroying it and winning the game.&#10;&#10;Source: Memory Alpha Wiki&#10;&#10;"

The game's distinctivie design feature is that batter-pitcher encounters are resolved by rolling the dice and consulting the pitcher's card. In some cases the outcome of the play is determined directly from the pitcher's card. In other cases the pitcher's card may direct you to a specific column (one of six) on the batter's card for the play result. The columns on the batter's card are organized to reflect the batter's normal, above-normal, and below normal batting average and slugging percentage.  Advocates of the game argue that dominant pitchers are more realistically simulated by this play design in that they exert more control over the outcome of each at bat than is the case for better-known baseball boardgames such as APBA and Strat-O-Matic.&#10;&#10;ASG also includes clutch hitting, errors, fielders' range, fielders' arm strength, infielders' double play ability, catchers' pitch calling, balks, wild pitches, stolen bases, stamina and unusual plays.&#10;&#10;The game was introduced in 1973 with player cards based upon the 1972 major league season.  The following year the company issued player cards based upon the 1973 season.  Afterward, faced with demands from the Major League Players Association for royalty payments for the use of player and team names, the game creator ceased production until the game was resurrected by 3W Games in the late 1980's.  Later, the board game was adapted to the personal computer and the software was sold under the name Diamond Dreams.

When you do this, put the card you&rsquo;ve matched in the middle of the game board and then turn up another card from you pile. If you roll the rainbow fish on your turn, you get to move to one of the pictures on the game board that matches one of your cards, and you get to choose another player to do the same. Look out for the shark, because if he turns up on the die, you lose your turn. The first player to get rid of all of their cards wins!&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;"

A player takes one action on a turn; an action can be moving a piece, attacking with a piece, or loading or unloading fighters (which can be carried by motherships).&#10;&#10;The different pieces move and attack differently. Fighters move two spaces a turn and can only attack adjacent pieces. Motherships can move one space or jump into hyperspace from the outer orbit (allowing them to re-enter any space in the outer orbit on a later turn), and they have beam weapons which can attack pieces two or three spaces away. Beam tanks and killer satellites also have beam weapons; beam tanks can only move around the inner orbit and satellites can only jump into hyperspace.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to remove all opposing pieces from the inner orbit.&#10;&#10;"
