Warriors who slay monsters, adventurers who grab loot, heroes who level up. Heck, halflings who stay at home eating pie all day. But the world of Munchkin is also sad and benighted, a place where those very same Munchkins are all too often backstabbed by buddies, dined on by dragons, and discovered by doom ducks. Heroes delve too deep, plummet down pits, and lose their loot &mdash; and that's before they die.&#10;&#10;Now what if you combined Gloom with Munchkin? Keith Baker of Atlas Games is doing just that! In Munchkin Gloom , players shepherd their parties through terrible travails and troublesome tribulations until &mdash; inevitably &mdash; they perish in pain. Naturally, the most miserable fellowship wins.&#10;&#10;"

The rules are simple: Play a card, comply the task and score the points.  There are three kinds of tasks:&#10; *A trivia question: Ask the question to another player. If his answer is correct, both you and that player gain points.&#10; *A puzzle: Make a certain card combination to score points.&#10; *A dexterity challenge: Complete some action that requires balance or sleight of hand.&#10;&#10;Based on a unique concept, Um Himmels Willen garantees fun, tension and variety for gamers of all ages.&#10;&#10;Um Himmels Willen is very interactive and contains also a special variant for Teams.&#10;&#10;Original description (German): &#10;Tante Lise hat gerade ein Farbenpaar ausgespielt, Oma Frieda der kleinen Hanna eine Quizfrage gestellt und Papa Ferdi versucht 10 Karten auf seinem K&ouml;rper zu verteilen, w&auml;hrend er eine Spielkarte auf seinem Kopf balanciert.&#10;&#10;Um Himmels Willen ist das Spiel der verr&uuml;ckten Karten. Denkbar einfach sind dabei die Regeln. Karte spielen, Aufgabe erf&uuml;llen und Punkte kassieren. Aus drei Kategorien k&ouml;nnen die Spieler eine Aufgabe w&auml;hlen: Quizfragen, Knobel- und Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben.&#10;&#10;Eine Quizfrage stellt man einem beliebigen Mitspieler. Kann dieser die Frage richtig beantworten, bekommt auch der Fragensteller Punkte. Man muss also kein Quizmaster sein, um Punkte zu bekommen. Die Mitspieler richtig einsch&auml;tzen zu k&ouml;nnen, ist viel wichtiger. Bei den Knobelaufgaben gilt es Kombinationen mit den verschiedenen Eigenschaften der Karten zu bilden: Farbe, Buchstabe oder Zahl zu Drillingen, W&ouml;rtern oder Stra&szlig;en formen und Punkte kassieren. Die Geschicklichkeitsaufgaben fordern Balance, Fingerfertigkeit und Spontanit&auml;t von den Spielern. Aber auch eine gute Beobachtungsgabe kann hilfreich sein um Punkte zu machen, gibt es ja noch diese &bdquo;Geheim&ldquo;-Karten. Passt man nicht gut auf, landet so eine fiese Karte schnell auf dem eigenen Punktestapel. Oder man verpasst eine Blitzaufgabe und kassiert Minuspunkte.&#10;&#10;Interaktivit&auml;t wird bei &bdquo;Um Himmels Willen&ldquo; gro&szlig; geschrieben. Ein Gro&szlig;teil der Aufgaben bindet mehrere Spieler mit ein. Jeder kann immer mitmachen, ist aber nicht gezwungen dazu.&#10;&#10;Durch das einzigartige Konzept wird f&uuml;r alle Altersgruppen Abwechslung, Spa&szlig; und Spannung geboten.&#10;&#10;F&uuml;r 3-6 Spieler, ab 8 Jahren.&#10;&#10;Eine spezielle Team/Familien-Variante erm&ouml;glicht es auch gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Gruppen Freude an &quot;Um Himmels Willen&quot; zu haben.&#10;&#10;F&uuml;r 2-6 Teams, ab 8 Jahren.&#10;&#10;"

The game of faro is played with only one deck of cards and allows for any number of players.&#10;&#10;A game of faro was often called a faro bank. It was played with an entire deck of playing cards. One person was designated the &quot;banker&quot; and an indeterminate number of players, known as &quot;punters&quot;, could be admitted. Chips (called &quot;checks&quot;) were purchased by the punter from the banker (or house) from which the game originated. Bet values and limits were set by the house. Usual check values were 50 cents to $10 each.&#10;&#10;The faro table was typically oval, covered with green baize, and had a cutout for the banker. A board with a standardized betting layout consisting of all cards of one suit pasted to it in numerical order, called the &quot;layout&quot;, was placed on top of the table. Traditionally, the suit of spades was used for the layout. Each player laid his stake on one of the 13 cards on the layout. Players could place multiple bets and could bet on multiple cards simultaneously by placing their bet between cards or on specific card edges. Players also had the choice of betting on the &ldquo;high card&rdquo; bar located at the top of the layout.&#10;&#10;Faro was popular in eighteenth century Europe and nineteenth century America, particularly on the frontier. It was also often rigged since it did not offer the house a substantial advantage. Once gambling houses became more regulated and cheating was less tolerated, Faro declined. By 1985 it was no longer played in any of the Nevada casinos.

Players perform each step in play order, so if Player 1 collects the resources in Cairo, Player 2 can't get Cairo's resources that turn. During the course of the turn, players move their minions to sites and collect the resources each site provides. Then they pay resources to execute schemes held in their hand, and earn progress points toward victory by doing so. To execute a scheme, a player must meet the scheme resource cost, and have a minion located in the scheme's site (for example, to subvert the U.N., a player must have a minion in New York). Action cards give players special advantages in moving minions, collecting resources, gaining new minions, or destroying enemy minions. The &quot;first player&quot; rotates each turn.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with a secret &quot;Ultimate Scheme&quot; card such as Ruin Christmas or Destroy Rock 'n' Roll. The Ultimate Scheme card dictates how many progress points the player needs to win, and what *kind* of schemes he or she needs to pull off. The game ends at the end of the turn in which the first player to complete his or her Ultimate Scheme does so.

By acquiring the resources for manuscript illustration and reproduction, your abbey produces and sells its valuable works, thereby bringing in finances necessary for maintaining a fine abbey. Will you succeed in making your abbey the most prestigious of all?&#10;&#10;Biblios Dice is a revision of Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game, which is itself a dice version of Biblios (originally called Scripts and Scribes).&#10;&#10;The object is to acquire gold and to collect resources &ndash; scrolls, manuscripts, pigments, quills, ink &ndash; to exchange for gold. It follows the same basic theme as Biblios, but with interesting changes due to the use of dice. As in Scripts and Scribes, players compete in five different categories, and the values of the categories change during the game. In addition, depending upon the dice roll, there may be many or few auctions during the game in which players auction their resources for gold or auction gold for resources.&#10;&#10;Biblios Dice differs from its earlier version Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game in a few important ways. Regarding the production and components, Biblios Dice has much nicer artwork, the game board has been divided into separate boards, and the resource dice are etched. Regarding the rules, Biblios Dice has a few important changes.  The goal of the game is now to collect the most VPs, rather than gold. There is only one type of auction in this game, and the first and second place winners of the auction get dice (not winner take all). The auctions also do not happen as randomly, but can be predicted based upon the progress of the mule on the market board.&#10;&#10;"
