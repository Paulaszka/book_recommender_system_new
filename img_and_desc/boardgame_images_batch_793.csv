Try to avoid getting CRAMP or a STITCH and you might just be the one to lift the trophy!&#10;&#10;Swimzania has been carefully researched and developed by ASA qualified swimming instructors, taking inspiration from the lessons taught in the pool. It embraces competitive and cooperative play, and is a brilliant way to reinforce kids&rsquo; (and adults&rsquo;!) knowledge of swimming and water safety awareness.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;We wanted to develop a board game that would appeal to both children and their parents. So Swimzania is not only fun to play, it also has important educational benefits,&rdquo; says Vladimir Scepunov of Swimzania. &ldquo;We have developed three levels of difficulty so that gamers of all ages can play and enjoy it, and we&rsquo;ve combined question cards with interactive challenges to get the players having fun and feeling good.&rdquo;&#10;&ldquo;We firmly believe in the power of learning through action,&rdquo; says Vladimir. &ldquo;Swimzania supports everything our students are taught in the pool, so it&rsquo;s a brilliant way to reinforce and strengthen their understanding of swimming. And they have so much fun while they&rsquo;re playing!&rdquo; &#10; Swimming and water safety are now included in the National Curriculum, so there is no better time to get kids playing a game that boosts their weekly lessons. A recent survey by Swim England reported that an overwhelming 94% of parents believe it is important for their child to be able to swim competently by the end of primary school. Playing Swimzania will help them to reach that goal even faster!&#10; &mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Their mission? Rescue the scientists and safely escort them back to the space shuttle.&#10;&#10;The game uses a modular board and a random spawn system for the aliens so that no two games are the same. The dice based combat system utilizing rating and strength will force the player to make tactical and strategic decisions throughout the game. An experience system is used so that as the battle rages on, soldiers will learn and be able to modify results later in the game.&#10;&#10;To win the game, successfully escort at least one of the scientists back to the space shuttle. If at any point all of the scientists or all of the soldiers are killed, then the game is over.&#10;&#10;Pod People from Another Planet!&#10;&#10;The human race realized long ago that in order to survive, it must leave its planet and populate the galaxy. The humans of the time understood that Earth wouldn&rsquo;t be around forever, and it would become uninhabitable long before it ceases to exist.&#10;&#10;It had been nearly 800 years since the first branches of humanity reached for the stars. In that time, the human race had become fragmented as colonies were established along the way. One such fragment was scouting a new planet that long range scanners indicated would be suitable for colonization. Protocol dictates that identified planets must be scouted by research teams before any attempt at colonizing is initiated.&#10;&#10;Research teams consist of various scientists who determine whether or not a planet is suitable for long term colonization and soldiers who protect the scientists from unknown danger. The soldiers have an important job, because scientists are valuable. Without the scientists, the expeditions to colonize new worlds would be halted, and training new scientists is a difficult task.&#10;&#10;Research of this particular planet, coded P-37 while still being scouted, was promising. P-37 appeared to meet all the requirements to initiate the terraforming stage of colonization. One of these requirements being that the planet could not be already inhabited by conscious life.&#10;&#10;While nearing the completion of the research stage of colonization, something went wrong &ndash; terribly wrong. Reports of ambush started to arrive from research teams around the planet. One by one, the teams were being wiped out.&#10;&#10;Scientists began to identify the attacks as psionic in nature, having encountered other alien life forms over the past 800 years with similar abilities. Utilizing this knowledge, some scientists were able to barricade themselves behind a psionic force field while the brave soldiers guarding them sacrificed their lives to buy the scientists the time to complete the fortification.&#10;&#10;The scientists knew the force field would only last a week &ndash; maybe two. They also knew their own value. Rescue teams would be coming for them, and when they were rescued, they planned to bring with them valuable information. They focused their research on the unknown aliens.&#10;&#10;What they discovered was both fascinating and horrifying. The aliens, whom the scientists started to refer to as Pod People due to the pods they emerged from, were not themselves conscious beings. There was indeed a consciousness on P-37, but the scientists failed to identify it in their previous research. The consciousness was the planet itself. The Pod People were being spawned by the planet as an extension of its own consciousness in order to protect itself.&#10;&#10;&#10;            &#10;        &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Your team of elite soldiers and others like it have been ordered to carry out rescue missions to bring these scientists home. You have been briefed on the knowledge related by the scientists on the surface and fitted with gear to help you fight the Pod People. You will land your space shuttle near the location of one of the barricades, locate the scientists, and escort them safely back to the shuttle in order to bring them home.&#10;&#10;"

You and your partner play barbers, running a hair salon. There are three chairs in your salon, and a queue outside your shop!&#10;&#10;Each chair is represented by a card, which has spaces to place cubes. The spaces designate the services for haircuts, sides and shaves. A deck of cards represents the customers. Each customer is unique, requiring different services - for example, a customer may need a haircut and side trim, another might need only a shave. Each of these service requirements are denoted by haircut, sides and shave icons on the customer cards. For the customer in a chair, you render these services by placing cubes on the cube placement spaces on the chair the customer is in. Each turn, if the chairs are unoccupied, a customer from the queue moves into a chair, and the queue is refilled to 3 customers from the customers deck.&#10;&#10;In the 2-player game, each player alternates taking turns. On their turn, a player rolls three dice, chooses one of the dice and takes an action associated with the dice score. These actions let you render the three different types of services i.e. hair, sides or shave. The second player then chooses one of the remaining two dice, and takes the associated action. The third die is for the Old Barber action - he is the shrewd old barber from the neighborhood. His actions almost always are meant to steal customers from you. He has many tricks up his sleeve for that - from offering free tea and coffee to chatting up customers to eventually lure them away from your salon! The players can counter him by taking 'Customer Preservation Actions' instead of the service actions - these can be buying tea for the customers themselves or by taking the help of a local goon to keep the Old Barber at bay! The players need to plan their actions carefully lest the die left for the Old Barber lets him steal a high- value customer!&#10;&#10;Players score points by &lsquo;completing customers&rsquo; i.e. by rendering all the required services. The customers claimed by the Old Barber through his actions earns him points. Sometimes, the players may need to work together to complete a customer to free up the chairs and move the queue forward - else the Old Barber may steal them!&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins! If the Old Barber has most points, he wins.&#10;&#10;In the solo game, the Old Barber challenges you to a &lsquo;hair-off&rsquo; or a hair-cutting duel in your own shop - and he plays as the second player. The rules remain the same with some slight changes.&#10;&#10;Barbers! was created for the 2017 Mint Tin Design Contest, where it stood 7th in Best Overall Design category from 37 entries, and 2nd in Best Theme!&#10;&#10;"

Six different room types can give you an attack bonus if your character type matches the room advantage. Weapons have character preferences and arming the right weapons can increase the power of your attacks. Use magical items for rerolls, healing, or other boosts for yourself or members of your party. Monsters have attack vulnerabilities and immunities, so you need to watch out and square off with the best suited members of your team!&#10;&#10;Players take turns exploring rooms in Wakening Lair, defeating monsters, disarming traps, and gathering weapons and magic items. Equip those items to maximize your hero's abilities, all in preparation to defeat the slumbering monstrous terror that is bound to awaken at any moment. When it does, you need all your collective power to keep it from escaping the lair and destroying the land!&#10;&#10;"
