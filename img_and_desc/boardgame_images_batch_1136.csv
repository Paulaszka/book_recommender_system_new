Do you remember how as a child you spent hours on end at an eight-bit console?&#10;One of the most popular video games was &quot;Tanchiki&quot;.&#10;This board game will bring you back to the atmosphere of those hot battles.&#10;&#10;Each turn you roll the dice and get a set of actions-maneuvers. For example: take a bonus, move your tank or shoot someone else's tank. Your goal is to destroy the opponent's headquarters or knock out his tanks until he runs out of lives.&#10;&#10;"

They need care and love, but unfortunately, there is not enough space in the shelter yet. Luckily, Lili and her friends - the players - are there to help! They're taking a few into their own home, and will look after them for a while until they find the best, loving owners!&#10;&#10;Each player can collect care tokens (such as bathing, feeding, and playing) on their own game board, creating the perfect temporary home for one or two of the animals. But the game doesn't end there - you'll also have to find the best real owners for your pets! Once you've done that, a space on the board will open up for you to temporarily adopt another pet. Players earn points for the animals they cared for and delivered to their future owners. The player with the most points win.&#10;&#10;As well as being endlessly cute and teaching responsibility in a subtle way, this game is also highly recommended because after two rounds your child won't be demanding that you take all the animals home from the shelter. This game shows that different animals have different needs and not all pets fit the same owner.&#10;&#10;Plus, Gondos Gazdik has great scalability! You can play cooperatively with younger children, helping each other and &quot;brainstorming&quot; together, and after a bit of practice, you can play competitively!

Perseverance has grown from a weathered foothold to a bustling city, where new landmarks improve our living standards, and expansive ranches contribute to society&rsquo;s welfare and the ongoing exploration. The once ferocious Shieldheads now walk among us tamed, and our brave Dino Riders are finally able to chart even the most distant parts of the wilderness. They come back with tales of abandoned structures in the far reaches of the island, similar to the one that held the secret of Shieldhead taming. If the rumors are true, we may be able to make our peace with even the stalwart Thunderhorns and the fearsome Ironjaws, and our society&rsquo;s influence will soon span the entire island!

Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;re ready for them!&#10;&#10;Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles - Episodes 3 and 4 are two medium-heavy, thematic Euro games, concluding the story of time-lost survivors on a dinosaur island. Each Episode is playable as a standalone game, or in the Chronicle mode that ties four games - one with each Episode - into a continuous story. As the hallmark of the Perseverance series, each Episode features many unique characteristics and a very distinct game feel, but their core mechanisms and concepts are similar, making each new Episode much easier to learn.&#10;&#10;In Episode 3, Perseverance is finally safe from the dinosaur attacks and has grown into a bustling city. As players discover how to tame and ride the Dinosaurs (including the new Thunderhorn and Ironjaw species), as their primary action, they may now choose to send a Dino Rider into the far reaches of the island instead of placing a die in the city. Besides streamlining some of the usual area majority elements, Episode 3 takes a new approach, focusing on engine and tableau building. City Landmarks provide powerful passive benefits, while players may build and customize their own Ranches on their player boards, activating them as a secondary action using the new Supply resource acquired from the wilderness.&#10;&#10;Episode 4 brings the story to an epic conclusion as you face off against the Ancients, a mysterious race that once ruled the island.

With 20 beautifully sculpted miniatures representing historically infamous characters, a 3D board to manipulate, and spooky and terrifying baroque artwork, this semi-cooperative game will make you question what you would be willing to do to escape hell.&#10;&#10;In Forsaken, the objective of the game is to escape from hell with the highest amount of FAITH (victory points) earned from benevolent acts, such as helping the player in last place. However, players can also choose to continue committing misdeeds and earning SIN (negative victory points) to reach the exit faster. Special milestones await players who risk earning SIN to advance ahead of the others.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, players will each receive a diary. Inside, you will have to create a tableau of cards to plan your day in hell. By adding these cards, you will establish your current and upcoming actions. When each day comes to an end, turn the page of your diary, and witness new actions unfold right before your eyes, leading to a fresh turn/day.&#10;&#10;The main actions are:&#10;&#10;     Movement (clockwise or counterclockwise), triggering events, traps, or milestones.&#10;     Drawing: Stack cards on the right page of your agenda for when you turn the page.&#10;     Help: Assist the last player on the board, helping them, and gain FAITH (VP).&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Some pods, though, have developed the &quot;bubble net&quot; feeding technique, where a whale dives deep below the fish and comes up, blowing a spiral of bubbles, confusing the fish and driving them into a tight ball, leading to a higher-quality bite!&#10;&#10;This is what we are replicating in Bubble Net. Each player is competing against themselves to eat more fish than they lose out to sea.&#10;&#10;Player boards are divided into segments that match the points of the compass.&#10;&#10;Set-up: Place a Fish token on every marked space, and the starting Bubble tokens on their spots. Shuffle the Fish cards and place the deck in the middle.&#10; On your turn, simultaneously with any other players, add one Bubble to the track. If the Bubble closes a segment, drive any fish present inward by one. All fish that are pushed into the very centre, which represents your Mouth, move into your Belly.&#10;&#10;Next, place your two Podmate tokens. They cannot share a segment with a Bubble, but they close any segment where they are placed - a whole whale needs a whole segment.&#10;&#10;The Fish respond: flip the top Fish card, and for every Fish icon represented, move all Fish tokens in that segment out by one space, unless the segment is blocked by one or more Bubbles, or a Podmate whale. Any Fish outside the spiral escape to the &quot;Freedom&quot; space, and can no longer be eaten.&#10;&#10;Continue alternating moves between the Whales and the Fish until any player has made a Bait Ball (all Fish are within the center spiral), then all players Lunge. All Fish within the center spiral go into your belly, and any outside that area escape.&#10;&#10;If there are more Fish in your Belly that escaped out to sea, you have won!&#10;&#10;Bubble Net is a multi-player, meditative solitaire game that takes around ten minutes to play and can have as many players as have boards. Players share the Fish deck; each card affects all players, a bit like Bingo, so new players can join the game at any point, continuing when others reach the Bait Ball stage.&#10;&#10;The interactive variant allows players to take on the role of their neighbors' Fish, with each person playing a Fish card from their hand face-down onto their neighbor's playing area before the Whales move, instead of drawing a single card that affects everyone from the Fish deck afterwards. Players may choose to score against each other instead of against themselves in this variant.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Right now, Springsign is a &quot;quaint&quot; little town (some might even say &quot;dead-end&quot; or &quot;completely-untamable&quot;), but under the right leadership its potential is limitless! Together, you will need to grow the town by constructing new buildings, keeping settlers fed, fending off bandits, and in many other ways keeping the town humming along. But there's a catch: this is not a cooperative game! The townsfolk will vote for a new mayor soon, and helping your political opponents won't get you elected. As the players develop town, they'll also have to outmaneuver and outwit one another to garner more support for their own campaign.&#10;&#10;Springsign is a light/medium-weight, town-building, resource-management game. Over the course of a 90-minute playthrough, you will influence and make use of the town's interactive economy, develop powerful card engines, and find ways of snagging invaluable votes from your opponents. The game's innovative &quot;Popularity &amp; Votes&quot; point system, where the players must time when to make best use of their popularity to win a vote, ensures that the game remains tight up till the end. The balance of powerful actions and limited resources make each turn tense and memorable, while the deeply-asymmetric player boards give each player a completely different playstyle and way of interacting with the game.&#10;&#10;The goal of Springsign is to win The Election at the end of the game by having the most votes. To get votes, you'll need popularity, which is collected through a variety of actions and abilities.&#10;&#10;When the chips are down, will you do what's right for Springsign, or will you push your way into office through anything (and anyone) who stands in your way? Those greedy enough to steal victory from their opponents will be able to win, and some players may be willing to risk the town itself in their race to the top!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

If you cross off all the numbers in a row, you win!&#10;&#10;On your first turn, roll the eight dice, then see whether you can use two dice to sum to 10. If you can mark a 10, you either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Set aside one die, and roll the remaining dice, hoping that two dice add up to a 9; if so, mark the 9 in the current row, then make this decision again for the 8, and so on. You never set aside more than three dice in total.&#10;    End your turn, passing all eight dice to the next player.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you end your turn, on your next turn roll all eight dice and hope to mark off the leftmost unmarked number in your current row. To mark off 7-10, you need two dice that sum to this number; to mark off 1-6, you need one die that matches this number.&#10;&#10;If you ever fail to mark off a number, mark the &quot;misthrow&quot; box at the end of the current row; next turn, roll the eight dice and hope to be able to mark the 10 in the next row down. If you have marked a misthrow in all four rows, start on the top row once again, trying to mark off the leftmost unmarked number. If you misthrow again in this row, mark through the row completely. If you mark through all four rows, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If any player crosses off all the numbers in a row, they win. If no one manages to cross off an entire row during the course of the game, whoever remains in the game the longest wins.&#10;&#10;"
