Each player uses the same starter deck of cards, but there are apparently additional sets of items available.&#10;&#10;The mages can transform between werewolf, human, and vampire, depending on the cards played. Spells cost cards (resources) to play, and have a series of effects - essentially healing, direct damage, or items that affect future card play.&#10;&#10;Different forms suffer different amounts of damage from various spells - a silver lightning spell, for example, affects werewolves more than humans. The different forms also have got some abilities. The werewolf for example has got the ability darkness more than night, which means the oppenents handsize is decreased by one.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to defeat your opponent a series of times, starting as a mage, and progressing to high mage, and finally to battle mage. Each rank has different life totals and has some effect on gameplay.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Extension and deck constructionFor more experienced players are some extensions available.&#10;With the extensions you are able to setup up your own decks.&#10;Each deck consists of 80 cards. Each card with the same name and the same icon you can take up to 8 cards into your deck. If the text in the middle part of the card has got a different color, you have to take less cards.&#10;Bronze = 4 cards&#10;Silver = 2 cards&#10;Gold = 1 card only&#10;&#10;You always have to play with an evil and undead transformation.&#10;&#10;The extensions have got different levels.&#10;The level of baseset is simple. The extensions demon and necromancer have the levels &quot;difficult&quot; and the extension lich is &quot;profi&quot;.&#10;There are some sample decks in some articles in the web available. The next SpielXpress magazine in decembre will explain some sample decks as well.&#10;&#10;Experienced players should play the game with the extensions right from the beginning. The baseset is for beginners only.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Tournament rulesThe game was designed for tournaments. You can find the actual rules in the games wiki.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;MageBattle is NOT a trading card game."

Quite soon, it became evident that the Finns, despite totally outnumbered, were not an easy match. They were better equipped for the cold winter to come than the opponent. Ski capability was high and moving in deep forest was no problem. On the other hand, the Soviet troops were scared to death of the forest and stayed as close as possible to the few roads.&#10;&#10;The Motti (Finnish term for &ldquo;encirclement&rdquo;) tactic became famous around the world and a great sympathy for the small country up in the north grew in many countries as the war went on. Soon, places like Suomussalmi, Tolvaj&auml;rvi, Kuhmo and Kollaa, to name a few, became famous for the heroic Finns fighting against overwhelming odds.&#10;&#10;The situation was not good for Stalin and his communist regime. Allied intervention was very possible and the prestige over the greatest army to date, The Red Army, was shaking. He also knew that Hitler was studying the campaign very carefully, making notes for every weakness in the old and poor doctrine of the RKKA.&#10;&#10;On March 13th, 1940, Finland had no other choice but to agree on the tough peace terms to follow. The Winter War had ended, but who won, or was it a stalemate? However, Finland kept its independence because the mighty neighbour in the east failed to take Helsinki among other vital objects, as planned.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;The first game of the trilogy to be released is the famous Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union, which is often referred to as an epic battle between David and Goliath. Historically the campaign lasted for 105 days, but will you as the Finnish side be able to last that long, or maybe longer? The game can last up to 16 turns (Dec. I '39 - Mar. IV '40), but in the 3rd volume (The Lapland War), there will be an extended option with a possible Allied Intervention. Vol.1 Winter War will include special features like Soviet Prestige and Finnish Morale.&#10;&#10;The object for the Soviet side is to capture as many important cities and factories as possible, as well as destroy the Finnish Army in an attempt to make the Finnish Morale Status plunge, which means the onset of peace negotiations. But time is not on the Red Army's side, a slow advance lowers the Soviet prestige, which can cause a negative outcome.&#10;&#10;Unit Counters&#10;The game will include eight countersheets in a total of 2.128 die-cut unit counters. Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.&#10;&#10;The Mapboard&#10;The mapboard will be 100 cm x 140 cm (39&rdquo; x 55&rdquo;) in four pieces, depicting Finland and its' vicinity in a &quot;Winterized&quot; colour.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;A 48-page coloured rule book includes basic, advanced and optional game rules.&#10;&#10;Order of Battle (OOB)&#10;Two OOB&rsquo;s are included, one Finnish and one Soviet. Both in full colour. &#10;A lot of sources have been used to make them as historically correct as possible. Also, four Small Scenarios have been included: (1) Salla, (2) Kuhmo-Suomussalmi, (3) Ladoga Karelia, and (4) Karelian Isthmus.

This was a bold surprise attack in the Germans back, the former brother in arms. Since September 4th, 1944, Finland was no longer at war with the Red Army, as the so called Continuation War had ended. One tough part of the peace terms was, that all German units were to be handed over to the Soviet Union. Because this was impossible, due to the fact that there was over 210.000 Germans in the northern Finland, the former brothers in arms had to fight each other under the supervision of the Soviet control commission. In the Barents Sea region, in an attempt to crush the German &ldquo;20.Gebirgs-Armee&rdquo; once and for all, the Soviet Army launched a large-scale attack called the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation. The last Germans left the Finnish soil in April, 1945.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;The final volume of the trilogy is an expansion, also loaded with a lot of extra features for the complete trilogy. In other words, to be able to fully use this package, ownership of both the earlier volumes is a requirement. The Lapland War game includes also the German operations &quot;Tanne West&quot; and &quot;Tanne Ost&quot; as well as the &quot;Birke&quot; and &quot;Nordlicht&quot; plans. The Lapland War game is divided in two separate battles, the one between the retreating Germans and Finnish units and the one between the German Mountain Corps and the Red Army north of the polar circle.&#10;&#10;Unit Counters&#10;The game will include one countersheet in a total of 266 die-cut unit counters.

There are several scenarios and a campaign system in numbers 7 and 8 of the same magazine.&#10;&#10;Several scenarios are available: Guildford courthouse, Brandywine (4 players) and 3 small actions from the same battle, Camden, Monmouth, Germantown.&#10;&#10;Requirements:&#10;&#10;Players will require these rules, several six-sided dice (d6), suppression markers, tape measures, a 4x4&rsquo; or 4x6&rsquo; playing area with appropriate terrain, and suitable miniatures. Typically is used 6mm miniatures on 40x20mm bases (unit faces long side) but the only real requirement is a standardized basing scheme. You may wish to use inches instead of centimeters with 15mm or larger figures.&#10;&#10;Game Overview:&#10;&#10;The game follows a ugo-igo pattern of alternating player turns. Games end when one side achieves its objectives or breaks due to mounting casualties.&#10;Each side operates several units. A unit represents either a company (60 men) or a battalion (600 men) and normally comprises three stands (or bases) of troops that always remain in contact. &#10;Officers and generals are represented by individual bases. Their role is to give their units or groups of units (called brigades) orders. Each officer and general has a command value assigned&mdash;a higher command value indicates a more capable officer and general.&#10;The crux of the game is the activation system. The player with the initiative (i.e., whose turn it is) identifies an officer or general and the unit(s) the officer or general wishes to order. &#10;Shooting is resolved with a single die roll (but many dice!) while melee requires a single competing die roll. Units can be suppressed or routed and stands can be killed. Over time, mounting casualties reduce the combat effectiveness of a unit.&#10;&#10;"

Players cast three wooden billets, known as Pa-tol sticks, onto a flat stone; how they fall indicates how far their piece can move. Landing on another player's piece sends it back to its start.

The winner is the first player whose marker completes a circuit of the track.&#10;&#10;While ostensibly a game of chance, descriptions of the game claim that expert players can throw the sticks to get their desired results.&#10;&#10;Rules and more information are available here:&#10;http://www.scienceviews.com/indian/indiangames11.html&#10;&#10;"

The board contains spaces with numbers, as well as spaces without numbers.  Players place their pawns on a non-numbered spot to begin the game.  A card is drawn showing a number that corresponds to one of the numbered spots on the board.  Players take turns attempting to land on that spot. How many spots a player moves on his/her turn is determined by a spinner.  Whichever player lands on the spot first collects the card.&#10;&#10;Another card is drawn, and the same routine continues until all cards are distributed and the winner is the player with the most cards.&#10;&#10;"

The territory held and political points value of a country determine its military strength.&#10;&#10;One of the key features to the game is ability to influence a minor power using your political points. If enough are used then there is a chance the minor power will be come friendly (allowing passage through their territory) or even allied (allowing use of their military).&#10;&#10;Like Diplomacy, orders are written down and executed simultaneously. In 1930! the orders include everything from movement to application of political power. Conflicts that arise are resolved according the combat strength of the forces involved with a simple percentage roll. In between turns it's time to make and break alliances with the other major power players.&#10;&#10;From the game designer:&#10;&#10;'1930! is my attempt to produce a game that retains a set of simple rules and the personal interaction found with Diplomacy, but extends the game play to include aircraft, the political or economic power of countries and many more neutral countries.
