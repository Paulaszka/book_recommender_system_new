The wobblier and higher the pyramid, the better. The start player takes the two sticks and we're off!&#10;&#10;The aim is to try and get as many cubes off the pile as possible using the sticks (either one or both of them may be used). But be careful! None of the other cubes must move or your turn is over and the next player can try his luck. And one thing's for sure--all of your opponents are going to be watching you with eyes like saucers. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to expose all the other players' scandals before they expose yours.&#10;&#10;No dice are involved.  A player may choose to move between one and six spaces clockwise around the board.  The player then follows any special instructions written on the space that he or she lands on (these include collecting a Dirty Tricks Card, collecting a cash handout from the Hush Fund, calling a Press Conference, using the Shredder, hiding in a Safe House, or Passing The Buck).  A non-player character, the Journalist, is moved the same number of spaces clockwise around the board.  If the journalist lands on a space occupied by another player, one of that player's three scandals is placed in the middle of the board and auctioned off to the highest bidder.  The player who wins the scandal card may then try to expose it by first landing on a Press Conference square, and then making an accusation against the player whose scandal it is.  The accuser may choose to blackmail the accused and accept a cash payment in exchange for a temporary reprieve, or the players contest the accusation using Dirty Tricks.  If the accusation is successful, the scandal is removed from the game and the accuser gets $50 Million as a reward.  If unsuccessful, the accused gets a scandal back and receives $10 Million compensation.  Once all a player's scandals are exposed, he or she is out of the game.  If the player who owns the scandal gets to The Shredder before being accused at a Press Conference, he or she takes the unexposed scandal back.  Play continues until only one world leader remains with any unexposed scandals...  He or she is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)&#10;&#10;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&#10;&#10;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.&#10;&#10;"
