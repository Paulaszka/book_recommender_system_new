Start with the basic rules, and when you have mastered these add some or all of the more realistic advanced rules. You can use any scale, of course - half all distances for 25mm scale, and if you insist on fighting Stalingrad in a matchbox an the 10.30 from Paddington, divide distances by 10 and use 5mm figures! As is inevitable, this has escalated to whole platoons (often still with one player per section) with some support such as a medium machine gun team or man-pack flamethrower team per side. We've never bothered very much about a points system, though one is included in the appendices to these rules, except that men defending a strong position such as a farmhouse should be attacked by about twice their number. Favourite games include two units of 10 partisans each, ambushing a German staff car with escort of two motorcycle combinations and a section in a half track, and a British Recce unit consisting of a turret less Stuart tank, a Dingo scout car and a half-track with infantry section running into a German advanced defence unit in slit trenches with MMG's and Panzerfausts. The possibilities are enormous, and great variety can be achieved quite cheaply, using Britain&rsquo;s or Airfix figures and vehicles, which are less prone to damage than Tamiya and other plastic models, though we use these too!&#10;&#10;Each soldier must have the correct rank, weapons and equipment, a limited supply of ammunition (so that he can run out!) and is identified by a number on his base. This number ensures that each man stays with his correct unit - if he's more than 20cm. from it, he has deserted! Wounds are NOT bullet wounds - you don&rsquo;t go anywhere with a bullet, in you, no matter WHAT John Wayne gets up to! Wounds restrict a man's fighting ability, and may eventually prevent him from fighting, though he may recover in time for a later round if you are fighting a campaign.&#10;&#10;"

The concept was developed by French essayist Guy Debord (1931-1994) in 1965, but not published for many years. Debord described himself as a filmmaker, but he is known as the founder and one of the most important members of the Situationist International, a small band of avant-garde artists and revolutionaries. One key concept of their theory is the spectacle: the image replaces substance and modern capitalist society is a society of &quot;spectacular&quot; commodity consumption. Having long been treated as a producer, the worker is now courted and seduced as a consumer.&#10;&#10;In 1977, Debord created a small publishing company named &quot;Les Jeux Strat&eacute;giques et Historiques&quot; with French movie producer G&eacute;rard Lebovici. The first game was Debord's &quot;Le Jeu de la Guerre&quot;, but only 4 prototypes are produced. The game was published as a book, with a map, rules and detailed descriptions in 1987. (Lebovici had been mysteriously shot in a parking lot in Paris by this time). In 1991, Guy Debord decides to insist that all his movies &amp; books be destroyed. It is also the fate of his book/game. Debord committed suicide in 1994. Nevertheless during the '90s, his work gains more and more influence. The book/game is published again in 2006 by French publisher Gallimard (price: 18 &euro;), but it's only a book (in French), co-signed by Debord's lifetime partner Alice Becker-Ho.&#10;&#10;The game uses a mapboard containing 500 squares (25 x 20) divided in two by a border line. Each territory has 2 arsenal squares, 3 fortress squares, and 9 mountain squares (blocking movement,shooting and communication lines). Setup of units (infantry, cavalry, artillery, horse artillery) is free and secret. At his turn, each player may move up to 5 units and/or attack. Aim of the game is to completely destroy the enemy or conquer his 2 arsenals. No dice: combats are resolved taking into account the attack/defense ratios of the opponents (unit retreats from -1, and is destroyed from -2) Communication lines are critical.&#10;&#10;The English translation published by Atlas has a faulty translation of the rules, making it more or less unplayable.&#10;&#10;"

For the most part, 3 Man Chess is played just like conventional Chess. &ndash; there was NEVER any intention of trying to make the game &ldquo;better&rdquo; because that can&rsquo;t be done. However, being able to play with three minds interacting creates situations that never arise in conventional Chess.&#10;&#10;&#10;     3 Man Chess&rsquo; circular game board consists of 6 concentric ranks of 24 files and an open central &ldquo;void&rdquo; that pieces may pass, but not stop on. There are teardrop shaped curves drawn on the board to help diagonal moves navigate the &ldquo;void.&rdquo;&#10;     3 Man Chess uses conventional chess teams (three of them!) &ndash; 16 pieces that follow all of their traditional rules; 8 pawns start on rank #2 protecting 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, a queen and a king which start on rank #1 (the outermost rank).&#10;     The teams are separated from each other by &ldquo;moats&rdquo; and &ldquo;creeks&rdquo; that are impassable at the start of the game.&#10;     Diagonal moves follow the drawn guidelines, passing across the center to the opposite &ldquo;spoke.&rdquo;&#10;     Straight moves may also pass across the central &ldquo;void,&rdquo; or move around the circular ranks.&#10;     After just a couple of turns around the board, strategy becomes intensely complex and fascinating! An unexpected move might well result in a cascading massacre. Defense is crucial since a diagonal move through the center, or a horizontal move around the center can sneak up behind you. Your two opponents can team up to checkmate you, or ultimately you can checkmate both of them at the same time!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.&#10;&#10;From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished.
