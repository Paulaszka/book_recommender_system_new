You have tactical games, operational ones, and a few grand strategic monsters. Yet each play is isolated with no meaning beyond the satisfaction of winning. Each victory is unconnected to others. Not any more.&#10;&#10;Winning any one of your tabletop games earns you or your opponent one Command Point. (Command &amp; Control) The Points are also earned during game-play when certain events happen.  For instance, the capture of a city/town earns a Point. The sinking of a major warship wins a point or successful bombing mission by heavy bombers against an enemy target wins one.&#10;&#10;The 'Master Game' depicted by my rules can include all of your tabletop games, miniatures play, and even video games. The idea is that each play represents a battle for a specific locale in the 'outer game'. Winning any of your games, and the points that success wins, drives your forces forward. It doesn't matter what era your tabletop game is, victory earns a Command &amp; Control Point.&#10;&#10;For example, if the 'Master Game' is to be WW2, you will track success of each of the War Powers of that era. War Power nations would be Germany, Great Britain, USA, Commonwealth, Italy, Russia, and Japan. Even playing solitaire works, since my rules don't require an opponent for use.&#10;&#10;If you choose to personally lead Great Britain, all the other nations would be lead by NPC characters.   These are Non-Player Characters. The points they win are kept note of in your records of the 'Umbrella War'. Those Points will come back in later tabletop games to give one side or the other the benefit of a die roll modifier, or die re-rolls.&#10;&#10;In your play you would have a Strategic Leader for each major power nation in the war. If you wish, the 'Umbrella Game' can be set in any era. Age of Sail enthusiasts will have Kings and Emperors. Civil War players could have President Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson opposing him. You could play out WW1 or WW2 history.  Modern war play is also easily incorporated in my concept.&#10;&#10;You can use NPC Officers as Operational Level commanders for army, navy, and air forces. Optionally, these officers can collect Points when they succeed in their missions. Each play of one of your games represents an engagement between two of the War Powers. That game can be a Strategic, Operational, or Tactical game - with the same effect at the end. a Command Point for the winner. If you want to track individual Operational commanders, you would assign NPC officers for both sides in each game played. Before starting a new tabletop game, you consult your notes and compare the Points for each officer.&#10;&#10;The side or Operational officer with the higher Points wins a die roll modifier for combat in the tabletop game about to start. Command Points won are accumulated in your 'Master Game' records. Individual game-play is meaningless any more. The concept is ideal for group or club play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
