However, if two souls descend at the same time, they will disappear!&#10;&#10;The game uses an irregular deck of cards, with 1-3 cards in each of ranks 1-6 in each of 3 suits.  Depending upon the player count, some cards are played face down, and others face up, but it is a &quot;must-follow&quot; game, and the highest ranked card of the lead suit will win.  However, in keeping with the theme, if two or more cards of the same rank are played, they are removed from consideration.&#10;&#10;The winner of the trick collects any remaining cards into a score pile.  All cards start at -1 points, but each rank has a unique scoring or play affect.  For instance, if you have at least three cards of rank 1, each of your rank 1 cards is worth +2 points instead of -1; each rank 5 card is worth +7 points if you have no rank 6 cards.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the number of players; at the end, the person with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Whenever a call came in, he grabbed his bag and rushed to the patient's bedside. Very often, however, he found that in his haste, he had brought the wrong cure. But did that stop him? No, he tried anyway, and, funny as it may seem, his patients would always get well.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players each choose a color of playing piece, and place them on Doctor Quack's house in the center of the playing board, to start. Each player draws one Cure Card. Players spin to see who goes first.&#10;&#10;In order to reach the different cases, players take turns spinning and moving their playing piece along a path of their choice. When they land on a case space, they can check to see if they have the matching Cure Card for that case. If they don't, they can either keep moving on subsequent turns to try to find and reach the matching case, or they can make their way back to Dr. Quack's house to pick up another cure. The other way to get an additional Cure Card is to spin a 6, 9, or 10 - then you can choose to take a card instead of moving that turn.&#10;&#10;Once a player makes a cure match, they collect that case card, which indicates a number of points on it. When all cases have been cured, the player with the most total points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Tokens can't share a space because of social distancing, and players will want to watch out for the screaming child because they'll have to pay to entertain the kid.&#10;&#10;This version of the Monopoly game makes the most of life at home with social distancing and missed activities like visiting a movie theater, yoga studio, and more.&#10;&#10;     HILARIOUS TOKENS: Racecar with parking boot, Rubber duck with babies, T-Rex with boxer shorts, smaller dog, penguin with coffee cup, Cat with bath cap., &#10;     UPDATED UTILITIES AND HOME-THEMED BOARD SPACES: In this family board game, WiFi and video streaming are necessary utilities, and board spaces are places in the home, such as the kitchen turned school.&#10;     AVOID THE SCREAMING CHILD: When a player moves their token, they also move the screaming child; if the tokens land on the same space, the player must pay to entertain the screaming child.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Community Chest&quot; becomes the &quot;Community Cupboard&quot;. Chance is still called Chance, but is now illustrated with boxes shipped from online orders.&#10;&#10;The money tweaks the classic design to look like a house, and each denomination features different food items inside the 'house'.&#10;&#10;"

They own the local mortuary as well as a mining company.  All they want to do is live in peace, take care of their ancestral home, run their businesses, and get along with the townsfolk.  The villagers of Banebridge, however, see it differently.  Many of them are firm of the opinion that at least some if not all of the &ldquo;Charming&rdquo; family are up to nefarious deeds and are, in fact, &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; of various sorts. To that end, they are constantly turning up evidence that implicates members of the family in foul play. Some villagers even start stalking individual members. Sometimes (well, a lot of the time really), the family members are forced to take action to deal with especially difficult villagers or incriminating evidence. Actions include Murder, Terrify, Beguile, Deceive, Extort, Bribe, Coerce, and many more. Of course, the family would NEVER take such actions if the villagers weren&rsquo;t constantly interfering.&#10;&#10;&#10;Gathering Gloom is a cooperative game for 1-4 monsters in which the players take on the role of a Witch, a Mad Scientist, a Vampire, a Werewolf, a Zombie, or a Ghost and work to resolve a series of crises at their mansion and businesses. Each character has one or more special abilities and some have vulnerabilities.  They use their own attributes as well as those of villagers they have beguiled into minions along with resources on their &ldquo;Misdeed&rdquo; cards to resolve 14-16 crises in order to win the game. Gloom gathers every turn based on events as well as from Evidence or Peril cards.  If the gloom reaches 50 or more before resolving all the crises, the players lose. Also, if the fear that the villagers have about anyone player reaches twelve or more, the family is exposed and the players lose.&#10;   &#10;The village has seven locations to visit along with three family locations on the board. There are many things to do on the map since each location has a unique action the player can take.  There are also alternate buildings that can be selected at setup to add variety to play.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll dice to determine events. Then you can move to any location on the board, where you may activate an on-arrival action; you may use cards to perform other actions; you may resolve crises in family locations. Finally, you check to see if any villagers or stalkers are going to activate. You draw up for your next turn, and you are done.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Players compete using members of the Rebel Alliance and denizens of Jabba&rsquo;s Palace in a game of rebel bravery and vile deceit.&#10;&#10;Based on the beloved card game and set in the Star Wars galaxy, Star Wars: Jabba&rsquo;s Palace - A Love Letter Game retains the simple and fun mechanics of the original as you utilize the talents of iconic characters from Return of the Jedi. Players take turns using the elegant &ldquo;draw a card, play a card&rdquo; gameplay and then executing the card&rsquo;s effect. Cards include characters like Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Salacious Crumb, Jabba the Hutt, and many more, with each card offering different effects, such as Boba Fett allowing you to take a card from another player, or Salacious Crumb allowing you to look at another player&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;Players use abilities from members of both the Rebel Alliance and Jabba&rsquo;s crew to outwit and outlast the others. On top of the classic mechanics from the original Love Letter game, Star Wars: Jabba&rsquo;s Palace - A Love Letter Game also introduces Agenda cards. This offers new win conditions, adding another level of strategy to the game.&#10;&#10;Agenda cards like Exalted One awards the player with the highest number in hand the win. However, cards like Jabba&rsquo;s Court and Rescue Mission switch it up and award the victory to the player with the most Palace or Rebels cards, respectively, in the play area. These and other Agenda cards ensure varied strategies will be needed with every game beyond simply eliminating other players.&#10;&#10;In a quick card game of rebel bravery and vile deceit, can you carry out your agenda while outthinking your foes?&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;"
