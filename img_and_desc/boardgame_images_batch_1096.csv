There is just one thing left: choose one of them to Ascend and finish the ritual. It&rsquo;s a simple choice, really. They are all the same &mdash; any of them will do! There is just one problem: some Investigators have infiltrated the ritual, pretending to be Cultists. And choosing any of them would ruin it all!&#10;&#10;Cult of Cathulhu is a fast-paced hidden role game for 4-11 players. Engage as a Cultist, trying to find trustworthy brethren with your unique skills and solve the lie-filled riddle -- or as an Investigator, trying to sneak you or your comrades in to halt the Cultists&rsquo; world-ending plans.&#10;Each player has two hidden cards: their alignment (Cultist or Investigator), and a separate skill card. Investigators are in the minority but know each other, while Cultists have to use their otherworldly skills in a search for just one Cultist they all can trust.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three phases: Mission briefing, Council, and Voting.&#10;Mission briefing lets the Investigators know each other, as well as other Investigators' skills. &#10;In Council, players can freely discuss and use their skills. Most skills either give information, e.g., by seeing others' cards, or help other players use their more powerful skills. &#10;Investigators can use their skills just like Cultists to fool them, with an extra advantage: they can use skills from any card, not just their own. Skill cards are always discarded after use, face-down. The Council is timed; after the time runs out, Voting begins.&#10;&#10;In Voting, all players simultaneously vote for another player. All players with the most votes are chosen to Ascend, and the game ends. If all chosen were Cultists, the ritual succeeds and all Cultists win; if any of them was an Investigator, the Investigators win, instead.&#10;&#10;&ndash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Their risky mission was to cut telegraph wires, burn railroad bridges, and damage track between Atlanta and Chattanooga, thus severing communications, reinforcements, and supplies between the two cities.

Reaching Bridgeport is a high priority since without that accomplishment, General Mitchel would likely call off his attack on Chattanooga. Mitchel might be otherwise unaware of the Raiders&rsquo; successes!&#10;&#10;The game ends when the Raiders player either passes through Chattanooga and reaches Union General Mitchel in Bridgeport, must abandon the stolen train, all Raiders are killed or captured, or the time track reaches 4:00pm.&#10;&#10;In the Two-Player version of the game (which was not included in the Print-on-Demand edition), as the Confederate player your goal is to keep the Raiders from accumulating Victory Points by relentlessly pursuing them, inflicting casualties, minimizing their ability to carry out sabotage, and keeping them from reaching Bridgeport before the game&rsquo;s end.&#10;&#10;"

Even if you cannot defeat the Wolf, you are still trying to reduce its point value as far as you can. You will play several hands against the Wolf, racing to 100 points.&#10;&#10;On each turn, you have the choice of several actions. The Wolf does not take turns.&#10;&#10;Perfect - play one card from your hand to capture one card of the same rank from the Wolf&rsquo;s hand, then draw a card.&#10;&#10;Sum - play more than one card from your hand, which must add up exactly to one card in the Wolf&rsquo;s hand, then draw a card.&#10;&#10;Split - play one card, and capture more than one card adding up exactly to the value of the card you play, then draw a card into the Wolf's hand.&#10;&#10;Over - play one card from your hand to capture one smaller card from the Wolf&rsquo;s hand, then draw one card into the Wolf's hand for every point of difference.&#10;&#10;Fold - If you feel you cannot safely make any more plays, you can stop.&#10;&#10;If the Wolf's hand is empty, you score the points remaining in your hand.&#10;&#10;If you Fold, the Wolf scores the points remaining in their hand.&#10;&#10;"

Players will share economic resources, city-building cards, and defeat. However, if they succeed, only the leader of the tribe most represented in the city will be remembered throughout all of time.&#10;&#10;The game can be enjoyed solo, or with up to four players, and is played using city-building cards and economic resource tokens. Each player takes the mantle of a Tribal Leader over one of six unique tribes, each with their own focus and deck of city-building cards. As Tribal Leaders, players must negotiate with one another to play cards from their own tribe, to enhance their dominion over the city, while also ensuring the city doesn't fall to chaos or destruction due to their selfishness.&#10;&#10;Pulling from a shared deck of compiled city-building cards, players take turns either placing or discarding cards from their hand. When placed, this card will trigger positive (or negative)effects based on the type(s) of cards adjacent in the play area. However, when a card is discarded, it is considered unplayable for the rest of the game and attracts attention from prowling Invaders who wish to do harm to the city. Each action must be carefully balanced to pursue one's own personal interests while maintaining the health of the shared city.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
