First to 4 disks of his or her color (out of 7) on the inner ring wins...&#10;&#10;Equipment: Each player is a color. Choose a color to be neutral. Players need: The board, 10 disks per player (separate into 7 and 3), a figure for each player, 6 bars of a neutral color (separate into 3 and 3), 9 disks of the neutral color, the figure of the neutral color, the gray figure, and the deck (without trilithon cards).&#10;&#10;During a player&rsquo;s turn, he has 1 of 3 actions that he can take:&#10;&#10;- Move as many neutral disks from a single inside cup. Take the disks into your hand. You will replace them after taking an action or two. For each disk taken in hand, you may move a component in the corresponding section to the left or right 1 space. You may move any component even if it is not your color. You may use multiple energy disks to affect a single component or spread them out as you wish. You may move the component into a new section, but cannot continue to affect it this turn (since it is in a different section, and disks from a certain cup only affect the corresponding section).&#10;&#10;If you a place component onto a spot that is occupied, the component on the spot is moved either left, right, in, or out 1 space as per your choice (no more out than the outer track, no more in than the inner track. Again, it is possible to push a component to another section). It is possible that moving the component pushes it into another occupied space, in which case, repeat the above process until there is no conflict.&#10;&#10;After using all disks in a cup that you want, take the disks that are in the hand and place them into different cups that the one they originated from. You may place the disks into inside OR outside cups, and you can split them up as you choose (all in one cup or split into multiple cups, etc.). This is supposed to represent energy conversion, which is necessary for casting a spell&#10;&#10;- Move as many outside energy disks as you want (regardless of the section they are in). Likewise, take them into hand first, and after taking an action per disk, replace them in different cups than the one(s) from which they originated.&#10;&#10;For each disk moved, you may move your figure, the neutral figure, or the gray figure 1, 5, or 20 spaces in either direction as long the figure is in the section the disk was in. You may use multiple disks on a single figure (i.e., move a figure 20 spaces using a disk in one cup, and then another 2 spaces using 2 disks from a different cup. If you move the figure onto a space occupied by another figure, both figures simply occupy the same spot (nothing special).&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s movement, but you can also move components using the outer cups. If yours, the neutral&rsquo;s, or the grey figure is on the inner track on the same space as a component, you may use an energy disk from an outside cup to pull the component in 1 space, or push it out 1 space. If you push/pull a disk into another, the disk is displaced as described above. If a disk is pulled down to the inner track, it gets pulled to the space the figure is on&#10;&#10;- Take any 2 neutral disks and put them into your hand. You may take these 2 from the same or different cups. Just before your next turn, place them in any cup or cups of your choice.&#10;&#10;For recap, the 3 actions are: a) take as many energy disks from a single inside cup, b) take as many energy disks as you want from outside cups, or c) take 2 disks off the board for a turn.&#10;&#10;As a special bonus, if a component of your color gets to the inner track, you may place one of your 3 extra disks on any cup of your choice. This counts as a disk that only you may use. When you use it, move it as any other disk in a cup. Also, once a component is on the inner track, it cannot be moved and no other component may move to that spot. Figures may ignore it for the sake of movement, and just move on top of it or through it.&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;When a player has gotten 4 of the 7 components into the inner track, he casts the spell, and thus wins. For a shorter game, play to 3 of the 7 components.&#10;&#10;"

It can be played on a table, on a floor or outdoors.&#10;&#10;Players start from making the race track. Depending on the environment they may draw it on a big sheet of paper, arrange it using available objects like books, boxes, tools, etc, draw it with a piece of chalk on a flat surface, or even cut it with a knife on the ground. For some game events the tracks were specially designed and made of gypsum.&#10;&#10;Then each player takes his or her bottle-cap, and puts it at the start line. To make the caps heavier they are usually filled with candle wax, gypsum, plasticine, clay, or even lead (for outdoor races only). The race begins then and the players - in appropriate order - finger-flick their bottle-caps towards the finish line, avoiding their &quot;cars&quot; getting out the track or stopping on trap areas that require players to go back, miss a turn etc.&#10;&#10;"

With paper and pencil ready, draw a card and roll the die. Ready, set, sketch it!&#10;&#10;Each card lists six items. The number rolled tells you what you will sketch. Each person will sketch a different item, and do so all at the same time. Draw fast so you can grab the higher-valued tokens &ndash; but don't draw too fast or you'll stump your opponent. In Sketch it, you score points two ways: when the player who received your drawing guesses what you've drawn, and when you can figure out the masterpiece you received.&#10;&#10;After ten rounds, the one with the most points wins! You're either the best artist, the best decipherer, a little of both, or maybe just the luckiest. No matter how it ends, players will sketch, laugh, and try to outsmart each other down to the nub.&#10;&#10;"

With Olympos, coming from French publisher Ystari Games, Keyaerts has another go at the simplified civilization game. The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 2-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, &quot;Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, &quot;This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.&quot;) By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development. Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources.&#10;&#10;Development takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries &ndash; such as medicine or phalanxes &ndash; or building architectural wonders. Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points.&#10;&#10;A player's piety is measured by discoveries, and the most pious player might be rewarded during the game by one of the nine gods included. Similarly, the less pious players might be punished by those same gods.&#10;&#10;The replayability of Olympos is huge, says Demaegd, as the discovery board and gods in play will be different each game, not to mention the territories you're able to conquer.&#10;&#10;"

They are the designated &quot;spinning areas&quot;, the only place on the spinagogue a player is permitted to spin.  A player can never intentionally spin the dreidel outside of the Spin Zone.  For MLD tournament play the Spin Zone decreases in size as rounds progress, usually every two rounds in &quot;head-to-head&quot; play depending on your bracket and every round in a &quot;total spin tournament&quot;.
