But players always has fewer cards than units (ain&rsquo;t that always the way?). The game focuses more on morale than raw strength, and in fact units and combat effects are measured in morale points, rather than strength points. While units pretty much obey the player&rsquo;s wishes, the card system makes for a very dynamic and unpredictable turn sequence.&#10;&#10;List Of Ingredients&#10;&#10;ITNOG comes as a 94 page book with a spiral binding and two player aid cards on card stock (despite what the back cover says, these are not laminated).

Also included are:&#10;&#10;Counters to be copied onto card stock and cut out. &#10;A chronology of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars &#10;A list of the battles between 1792 and 1815 &#10;Army Lists with commander ratings &#10;A small scenario the Battle of Arroyo de Molinos. &#10;Players will need to make a variety of counters or markers to play the game, or else develop paper rosters if they prefer.&#10;&#10;"
