Most of the cards are action cards that allow players to &quot;Dig&quot; up more cards, steal from other players, etc.  Being too greedy can result in a cave-in, eliminating the player from the game.  When the deck is exhausted, the remaining players total their rubies, and the highest value wins; or if all but one player is eliminated, that player wins immediately.&#10;&#10;The skill sets involved are risk management, and to a lesser degree, card-counting and bluffing.&#10;&#10;Game rules include a variant for 4-5 players with the addition of another set of cards with the same game play.&#10;&#10;"

This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;&bull; Four maps (maps J, K, KK and R)&#10;&bull; Separate Scenario Sheet for Scenarios 1 and 4&#10;&bull; Three Soviet Set-Up Cards&#10;&bull; Two Axis Set-Up Cards&#10;&bull; One 11x17 inch folded Chart Card with Combat Results Table, Terrain Effects Chart, movement charts, artillery and Non-Op HQ charts&#10;&bull; One 11x17 inch folded Chart Card with &ldquo;How to Read Units&rdquo; information, air combat, AA fire, interdiction effects, overrun and combat-related charts&#10;&bull; One light blue 11x17 inch folded Chart Card with Scenario Tables, Victory Conditions and a second Combat results Table&#10;&bull; One 8 and 1/2 x 11 Card with Turn Record track and Weather Table&#10;&bull; Two Air Unit Status/Unit Rebuilding Cards (one each for Soviet [tan] and Axis [gray])&#10;&bull; Cards 1120 die-cut counters in four counter sheets&#10;&bull; One ten-sided die&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.&#10;&#10;Despite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.&#10;&#10;Note that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?&#10;&#10;THE SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;1) Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.&#10;&#10;2) Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.&#10;&#10;3) Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?&#10;&#10;4) Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.&#10;&#10;5) To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?&#10;&#10;6) To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?&#10;&#10;7) Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles. Neither player has resources to do it all but it can be fun trying. The East Front experience is not complete without playing this full-size scenario.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     2 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     5 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Division/Regiment; Air unit 40-80 aircraft&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     1-4&#10;&#10;(from GMT website, components list from Playbook)&#10;&#10;"

Yes  but here is something almost completely different from any WWII Campaign game you've seen: no CRT (or any other tables), buckets o' dice, and cards  all used in a totally new approach to gaming that can be learned in 5 minutes and played in a few hours.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules and mechanics for Blood &amp; Sand will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. However, Designer Richard Berg, no stranger to this campaign, has added to this accessible simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no sirree!&#10;&#10;The game also uses cards, one deck (of 27) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (The cards don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you're so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units, build fortifications, or bring in Reinforcements. The RP choices are theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent's) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement, to forcing the Allies to Withdraw units, to the effects of Rommel and other leaders.&#10;&#10;What the Players are Saying: Here are some the reactions from the Blood &amp; Sand play testers and rules readers:&#10;&#10;&quot;Very simple and very easy. No one should have a problem with the rules.&quot;  Adam Freitag&#10;&#10;&quot;I would hope to use it as an introductory wargame, but I am optimistic that it would be sufficiently interesting to keep experienced wargames happy as well.&quot;  Paul Marjoram&#10;&#10;&quot;This looks like a fun game  The added tension of the need to balance the use of RPs [Resource Points] for units, forts and cards is appealing - a good abstraction of the logistics concerns of the campaign.&quot; Edmund Hack&#10;&#10;&quot;Using cards in this manner may make for some very agonizing decisions - a good thing in a game. I also think the combat system is clean and simple, yet effective.&quot; Jeff Paul&#10;&#10;The rules for Blood &amp; Sand are only 8 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire, covering four scenarios, ranging in size (the two maps are used only in the full campaign game) and playing time Playing time for the Basic Game has averaged about 3 hours. 176 counters including the blanks).&#10;&#10;"

Although anger is a natural emotion in response to conflict situations, it can jeopardize relationships if it is not communicated effectively and appropriately.&#10;&#10;Typically, people react inappropriately to anger in one of two ways. The first is by overreacting to conflict situations by becoming verbally and/or physically explosive to others after allowing anger to build up. Secondly, a person may react to anger by internalizing their frustration with a conflict situation which often results in physiological or emotional symptoms of stress.&#10;&#10;The Anger Solution Game  was developed through the integration of a psycho-educational approach with cognitive behavioral intervention modality. The main goal is to help the client to understand that he/she has control over behavioral responses to anger and that he/she can make choices which can result in positive solutions.&#10;&#10;"

The board is a hexagonal grid (9 cells on a side), with each cell containing a number from 1 to 20. At the start of the game, English consonants are assigned to the numbers (written in an auxiliary area, not in the grid). After that, each player looks for words that can be made from chains of adjacent cells snaking in any combination of directions, ignoring vowels and allowing a single letter to stand for a double letter.&#10;&#10;Each player writes down their word on paper and then, on their turn, writes the appropriate consonants on the cells used and challenges their opponents to guess the word. A successful guess gives the points to the opponent, otherwise the player gets a point per cell used. In either case the used cells are out of play.&#10;&#10;There are a few further wrinkles, including one where, if a player manages to enclose an area with his or her color and the edge of the board, he or she may claim all the enclosed spaces.&#10;&#10;"

Each player begins the game with 5 daggers, and places one of them on the starting 'foot-print' at the beginning of the game. Each turn every player gets 6 movement points to share between his daggers (ie move 1 dagger forward 6 footprints, or 2 daggers 3 footprints each, or any combination up to a total of 6). You can 'leapfrog' your own daggers, (but may never have 2 daggers on the same footprint) and at the end of each move the dagger is 'stabbed' into the board. When a dagger is placed in one of the randomly selected footprints the Vampire will let out a bloodcurdling scream causing that dagger to be removed from the game. Players have to remember which footprints will wake the Vampire and avoid them for the rest of the game. The first player to reach the centre of the board and stab his dagger into the heart of the Vampire wins!&#10;&#10;"

The twist here is that the counters are placed in a series of 5 boards of differing size that are formed to make a pyramid, hence the name &lsquo;Quinamid&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple, with any one of  3 options available to the player : &#10;a)    Place a counter in a vacant space&#10;b)    Rotate a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) through 90 degrees&#10;c)    Move a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) one &lsquo;position&rsquo; in any orthogonal direction.&#10;&#10;An important rule is that the subsequent player may neither move NOR rotate a board which was moved or rotated by the preceding player.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to make their move until one of them reveals a line of 5 counters, this being in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction.&#10;&#10;As players use option c) above they will &lsquo;cover&rsquo; boards below, thereby hiding the contents. It follows therefore that there is a bit of memory required to recall what was under the various boards if you are to use it to your advantage.&#10;&#10;A game is often completed in 2 or 3 minutes so replay value is high. It is often better to play a &lsquo;best of 5&rsquo; series to employ different strategies, so that would take around 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;The game should appeal to players aged 8-80. It could be played whilst waiting for a meal to be prepared or as a post-prandial diversion with other players spectating and giving out &lsquo;advice&rsquo; !
