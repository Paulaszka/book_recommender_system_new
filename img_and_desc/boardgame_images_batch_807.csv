The Union and Confederate players each have their own card decks, reflecting the relative strengths and weaknesses of both sides. The Union player must do all the running to win the game by the time they have cycled through the Union card deck for the third time, having accumulated the required amount of victory points by capturing Confederate controlled areas, as well as squeezing the Confederate player with a naval blockade. The Confederate player must hold on and thwart the North's victory ambitions to win!&#10;&#10;Each time the decks are cycled, the Union player adds some better quality cards, becoming stronger as the game progresses, where as the Confederate player adds lower quality cards, becoming weaker. The underlying game mechanism is one of &quot;deck destruction&quot; rather than the more normal deck-building.&#10;&#10;Cards have multiple uses and can be recycled if used one way but during the course of the game you have to decide which cards are going to be permanently sacrificed from your deck cycle to allow you to build units.&#10;&#10;"

Did someone have a better idea than you?  Don't worry, you can stab them in the back and take all their points if you &quot;know people&quot; in the Industry.  After all, it's showbiz.&#10;&#10;What The Film?! is a fun party game where you get to come up with crazy movie ideas based on the hand you're dealt. On a player's turn from their hand, a player lays down an actor, set, and plot card. With 300 cards the mashups are endless. Not only are you competing with your friends, you are also fighting the clock. After cards have been played, you have exactly 36 seconds to pitch your movie magic to the table.&#10;&#10;Voting is done simultaneously, so you don't have the time to persuade anyone at the table, no one like beggars in the film industry! On the count of three, everyone hands their colored award token to who they thought had the best movie. The player with the most points keeps their cards as points, everyone else discards the cards they played.&#10;&#10;We know not everyone is a director at heart, for that reason we added Industry Cards. There are two types of Play Immediately's and Play and Discard and contain good and bad things that can occur on your turn or someone else's. For instance, one card can have you stealing the rounds points or another, causing you to pay union dues, which cause you to lose cards.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, the person with the most points is declared the winner, and just like that, you're ready to receive your director of the year award!&#10;&#10;"

Each card features two of six possible evidence icons on one side, but only one of those two on the reverse side.

On their turn, a player selects one card and the other players arrange their hands to indicate which of their own cards feature the icons that they can see on the back of that card. The player must then deduce what icon or icons are on the reverse of their card, taking into account that what they see in other players' hands is not exactly what those players themselves can see. If they deduce correctly then the evidence may be enough to convict a suspect. But if they guess wrong then that suspect is acquitted. To win the game, players must together convict ten suspects without acquitting too many.&#10;&#10;The cards feature historical mugshots of real suspects arrested in Sydney, Australia, during the 1920s razor gang era.&#10;&#10;"

Play begins with the auction of an item you might find in a classified section of the newspaper, on Craigslist, or in the uniquely Maine publication, &ldquo;Uncle Henry&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Players take turns auctioning these Classified Items to each other and bidding on items to add to their own collection.&#10;&#10;Each Classified Item has a point value.

Lesser items, like the Blueberry Rake, are worth as little as 5 points.&#10;A player only earns the points indicated on a Classified Item when they collect the complete set of four cards. When two players each hold the same Classified Item card, one player may &ldquo;Downeast Deal&rdquo; to try to capture the set.&#10;&#10;Downeast Deals are when bluffing becomes a major element of the game.

Each 'Stache Card contains a location where you can potentially set up 1 bureau.

DECOYS&#10;Decoys can be placed on the tile of your choice (except on a flag) without needing to play a 'Stache Card.&#10;&#10;You can gain a Decoy by purchasing it from the 'Stache Cards in your Vault or you can also gain one by placing a Bureau on a tile with a SUITCASE SYMBOL.&#10;&#10;Decoys count as a yellow square in terms of your Secret Agendas.

In the first edition of the game in 2015, each game also bore a unique title, such as &quot;The Mother in the Clouds&quot; or &quot;The Vampire in the Yard&quot;, but this made it difficult for people to identify the game. The second edition in 2018 carries the Le jeu aux mille titres title at top, along with a unique title for the artwork along the bottom of the box, as if the art were a painting in a museum.&#10;&#10;"

With that signal, the 225 men of Dog, Easy and Fox Companies of Force &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the 2nd Ranger Battalion launched one of the most incredible and seemingly impossible assaults of military history.&#10;&#10;Tasked with landing on the beaches of Normandy, France and scaling the towering 100-foot cliffs at Pointe Du Hoc in the face of determined German defenders, the Rangers were the only force that could possibly meet this challenge. Despite initially heading in the wrong direction and landing in jumbled order, the elite Rangers were eager to begin their ascent. Their mission was to find and destroy the six huge 150mm artillery pieces that were deployed in the area. These guns had to be neutralized lest they rain down a massive barrage on the American forces landing at nearby Omaha Beach. And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the Rangers were also ordered to set up roadblocks on the Vierville-Grandcamp highway to delay and harass any Wehrmacht reinforcements from reaching and counterattacking the D-Day landings.&#10;&#10;The Ranger battalion climbed the massive heights against stiff resistance and advanced inland, suffering severe casualties in the process. They took many of the German positions, but no guns were to be found. The Rangers then fought off vicious counterattacks, launched by the German 726th and 914th Grenadier Regiments, and were nearly pushed back into the sea. But under the inspired leadership of Lt. Col. James Earl Rudder, the Rangers held on and eventually found and destroyed the concealed guns and established the needed roadblocks. Bravery and perseverance won the day for the Rangers as they completed another successful chapter in their glorious history.&#10;&#10;Crowbar!: The Rangers at Pointe Du Hoc is a solitaire wargame (with two-player and cooperative variants) which abstractly simulates the ebb, flow and risk of the Pointe du Hoc assault, with you playing the attacking Rangers. The game system traces its parentage to the popular &quot;In Magnificent Style&quot; game and mirrors its speed of play, tough decision-making and heart-pounding push-your-luck excitement. But Crowbar! has been updated to allow for an even smoother gameplay experience. For example, instead of the old &ldquo;dice matrix&rdquo; system to determine unit movement results, the game now utilizes four custom Movement Dice. Each die is made up of different results, escalating the possible risk/reward ratio. Dice are thrown one at a time and can be read instantly to determine what happens to the unit. The system also challenges you with even more events, including constant German counterattacks, ammunition shortages, artillery bombardments, booby traps and other surprises. Your goal is to meet your various objectives as quickly as possible, before the German defenders can dig in even deeper and before they can organize effective counterattacks. Ultimate success or failure in the game is measured by how well you do as compared to the actual heroic accomplishments of the Rangers on that historic day. Are you up to the challenge?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV. As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France's borders. This was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King's ultimate aim this was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis' war of middle age - a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.&#10;&#10;The war opened in Germany, but the Habsburgs, France's Great Enemy, also owned, or had suzerainty over, much of northern Italy. Coalition forces in Italy were weak, the Habsburg Emperor more concerned with his ongoing war against the Turks. However, the French could not spare many regiments for a second front. But, in 1689, the Spanish Habsburgs also declared war on France, fearing for their lands in the Low Countries. Unfortunately, this put their northern Italian possession of Milan squarely in King Louis' sights. This was a place the French felt they could take, but they would have to be quick about it. There was one potential obstacle: the House of Savoy.&#10;&#10;Duke Victor II Amadeus was a French puppet. But, he was also a vassal of the Emperor. And, he coveted Milan for himself... The French planned to cross the Duke's lands, which straddled the western Alps, and launch their invasion of Milan from that state's borders. The mistake King Louis made was to assume Duke Victor would obey his will regardless of how he was treated. The arrogance of the French soldiers and their king combined with Duke Victor's self interest and Coalition gold to push him into the Allied camp. He refused access to the French and found himself at war with them. The Duke was a complex character. Young and valiant, he desired glory over the French in battle, but soon found himself outmatched while his allies proved unreliable. Yet at the same time, he understood how to dissemble and manipulate. What he could not achieve on the battlefield he accomplished in a backroom deal that bought him not only a separate peace with France in 1696, but command over the very French army he had been fighting for the past six years! It was he who led the invasion of Milan!&#10;&#10;The war in Italy typified military campaigning in this period. Thwarted in their plans to invade Milan from Piedmont, the French attacked Duke Victor, spilling out of the alpine passes and across Piedmont. But, they could not establish a permanent base and had to withdraw. This flow and ebb was a feature of the early years. Sieges and battles were fought but none brought a lasting advantage to either side. In 1692 the Coalition in turn invaded France but found themselves plagued by the same problems that had beset the French. By 1694 the situation was deadlocked, both militarily and politically. However, on the political front, Duke Victor and King Louis were gradually approaching an accommodation. In 1695 the Sun King at last made some hard concessions. The following year Europe was shocked to learn Duke Victor had changed sides. His defection began the rush to peace, as the Powers tried to obtain the best deal possible for themselves.&#10;&#10;In Army of Italy, you will have a chance to change history - and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books.&#10;&#10;As the French, will you steamroller your ungrateful puppet state or simply make life so uncomfortable that she decides to join you after all? Then, the invasion of Milan can begin. The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and access to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you command a secondary front. Versailles will forever be taking regiments away from you, forcing you to rely on your wits. If you garrison every post, you will be too weak to go on the offensive. If you do nothing, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies.&#10;&#10;As the Coalition, can you keep the French at bay? Or can you damage them enough to try a counter-invasion of France? Will the English send their fleet and land troops to aid you? Or, will the Holy Roman Emperor divert his attention from the Turks long enough to spare you some Imperial regiments. Duke Victor is not to be trusted. His actions belie his noble declarations. If you are not careful, the House of Savoy may surrender or even switch sides...&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;1) Five map sections representing the region of the Maritime Alps and the upper Po Valley at one league (4 Km) per hex. The fifth map shows the main area of conflict, allowing players to dispense with some of the maps for most scenarios, in case space is at a premium.&#10;&#10;2) 840 die cut counters representing the forces of the French and their opponents - Savoyards, Huguenots, Waldensians, Spanish, Austrian, and German. Scale is Battalion - that is, the playing pieces represent battalions and regiments.&#10;&#10;3) Rules, charts, tables, and display cards.&#10;&#10;4) An historical commentary.&#10;&#10;"

The first player who reaches 20 points (40 points for 4 players) on board meter, will be the winner of the battle. Damage points are equal to life points (red cross with specific number in each card).&#10;&#10;Every card has 7 different sectors (boxes):&#10;&#10;Upper: from left to right :&#10;First box - Velocity of weapon&#10;Second box -  Weapon's Penetration level &#10;Third box - Own armor level&#10;Fourth box - Own life points&#10;&#10;Lower:&#10;First box - movement &#10;Middle Double number target - 2 x 12sided dice (black for German/White for Soviet), both numbers in dice is the damage area for the weapon. A 10 on the dice is a Critical hit &amp; any unit who receives this damage must be removed from the battle ground.&#10;Finally, the blue pointer with the specific number is the encounter points needed for this unit to use it in the deployment phase of the battle.&#10;&#10;Each turn:&#10;1. Encounter points (both armies start with 5 each)&#10;2. Draw phase - each player draws 2 cards&#10;3. Move phase - each player can move their units&#10;4. Deployment phase - each player can deploy any unit if he has the necessary encounter points&#10;5. Engagement phase - each player can attack the enemy player based on the abilities of their units&#10;6. Discard phase&#10;7. End of turn&#10;&#10;Before the first turn all players must draw 5 cards each and receives 5 encounter tokens. There is a 7 card hand limit. Some cards can give the player the ability to draw a general commander&#10;card from their own general deck.&#10;&#10;There can be no more than 2 generals active during the battle, but a player can change a general card by discarding the old one and playing a new one.&#10;&#10;Each general gives 1 additional encounter points in the beginning of each turn. Also, each player receives 1 encounter point every turn and 1 additional point for every unit deployed in the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Players can combine cards if it is allowed in the card's description but only until the end of the turn (except the end of battle for some cards)&#10;&#10;Air units are visible during the battle and while performing an attack. If enemy anti-aircraft wapons are available, they must be countered&#10;&#10;Units with low penetration levels cannot attach enemy units with higher armor level.&#10;&#10;Special cards can give the player's units unique abilities during each battle.&#10;&#10;First player who reach 20/40 points will be the winner of the battle &amp; the game ends.&#10;&#10;"

During each attempt, the player will roll a black and a white die (and if possible an additional scattered die). If the die-roll seems unsuitable, the roll may be discarded by scattering the dice. This can be done only a limited number of times.&#10;&#10;The player may alter the results with special abilities, if these are charged up. After that, the dice are assigned to their respective detectors (depending on die color and number).&#10;&#10;Dice of opposite color in the same detector annihilate.

To start play, lay out all of the light-colored patches at random in a circle and place a starting marker in a particular location. Each player takes some buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the starting marker or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the starting marker to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts six 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place six actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on their game board.&#10;&#10;At some point during the game, dark-colored patches are added to what's available for players to take, and these pieces are smaller than the light-colored ones, making it more likely that they'll fill in holes on a player's board.&#10;&#10;"

Over five rounds, players program their decisions about price, production, research, and expansion. The game features a unique mechanism of planning, which combines patching mechanisms with bidding and action selection. Each of the rounds consists of eight simple phases: planning, pricing, production, development, research, expansion, selling, and profits.&#10;&#10;In the planning phase, all players simultaneously make decisions for the next year by overlaying (&quot;patching&quot;) their two plan cards and all of their development tiles. The actions they plan on their cards and tiles in this phase will determine what actions they can perform during all of the later phases.&#10;&#10;In the pricing phase, players change the price they charge for their smartphones based on their plan. A lower price helps to go earlier and sell more smartphones on the market, but a higher price, while risky, helps players to earn more money.&#10;&#10;In production, all players produce smartphones.&#10;&#10;In development, players take development tiles, which expand their planning possibilities in future rounds.&#10;&#10;In research, players discover new technologies. Each technology not only expands players' ability to sell smartphones to customers, but also gives them special powers they can use during the game.&#10;&#10;In the expansion phase, players open offices in neighbor regions, which allow them to sell in that region and develop their network of offices to more regions in further turns.&#10;&#10;In the sale phase, players sell the phones they produced in regions where they have offices. But there is limited space in each region - and if your price is too high, cheaper rivals can block you from selling.&#10;&#10;In the profit phase, players get income for their sales. Players gain the sale prices for all of their sold smartphones, and the player who sold the most phones in each region gains a bonus for controlling the accessory market. At the end of this phase all sold smartphones are discarded from the map - and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the richest player wins.&#10;&#10;"
