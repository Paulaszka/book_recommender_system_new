Players take turns drawing and playing cards until someone collects three colour coded sets of crypto currencies and lays them out on the table.&#10;&#10;Players pick up cards and attempt to collect 3 matching sets.  The  first play to do so wins.  However, event cards can stop your efforts!&#10;&#10;The game becomes increasingly intense as each player builds their crypto portfolio, as each player's crypto trading strategy becomes apparent. This is when you'll have to use all your strategic might. GOOD LUCK!&#10;&#10;"

As brave explorers, cartographers and astronomers, players set off from Baghdad to map the surrounding land, waterways, and heavens above. Players must carefully manage their caravan of workers and equipment, while reporting back regularly to journal their findings at the House of Wisdom. Will you succeed in impressing the Caliph, or lose your way and succumb to the wilderness?&#10;&#10;The aim of Wayfarers of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game's end. Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water, and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and exploration. As they make discoveries, players will want to quickly journal their progress. The game ends once one player&rsquo;s marker has reached the far right column of the journal track.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham.  1848LT is set in the western part of the US.&#10;Two to six players represent investors in railroad corporations, spending their initial capital to buy wholly-owned Private and Subsidiary Companies and shares in Public Corporations and the Credit Mobilier.&#10;&#10;The Public Corporations, each controlled by the largest shareholder (its President), build track and run trains in order to earn revenues.  These can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock. &#10;A key feature of 1848LT, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of the President and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.&#10;&#10;Being a President is not without its difficulties, either; bailing out an insolvent Corporation is the sole responsibility of its President.&#10;&#10;&mdash; user description&#10;&#10;"

In addition to word challenges similar to the classic 'Pass the Bomb' game, this Family edition for 3 to 8 players adds simple skill/dexterity challenges like catching a ball in a cup or quickly 'building' a worm out of puzzle pieces. The word challenge categories are 'Word Acrobat', 'Rhyming Artist', and 'Typical' (thematically-related words). The 'bomb' is an electronic ticking timer that can 'explode' with no warning during the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

In the game you will start training the physical and mental qualities of your jumper. You will manage its energy, which will be important in racing. Of course, you will jump from a ski jumping hill with a realistic-looking jumper figure. &#10;As in real jumps, you will solve not only the length of the jump, but also the style and point evaluation of the judges. Your jumps will also be affected by the wind and also the equipment in which you will jump. &#10;The aim of the game is to place as best as possible in the individual races of the cup tour and become its overall winner.&#10;&#10;At the beginning, each player slides the jumper's figure from the hill, and based on the distance determined by the rollers, we determine the order in which the player's cards are selected. Each of them have certain predispositions such as psyche, speed, technique, etc. Once we have chosen the player's card, we go to choose the flag of which nationality you want to represent. There is also a card draw on which hill we will jump. They are shuffled, then turn. So let's say it's going to be Japan, for example. This card is placed on the 3D hill and indicates to us what nation we jump in. Based on that, the home jumpers will benefit from a better meters rating simulating crowd support. And then the size of the hill is randomly selected by turning over the top card of the bridge and finding out that we are racing on the K90 hill, for example. Then we can go into the training of our ski jumper (players cards). Based on the different predispositions of individual jumpers, we can improve individual training skills, which happens in specialized rooms in gyms on the board and therefore we can choose which ability we want to improve. They are on special cards. This gains points on the player's card, but we lose time and energy while we train. And as we lose time, we gradually get closer to the day of the race, and as soon as we get to the seventh day, we can go jump from the hill. Before the race starts and we go jumping, we calculate the points we have gathered in training and then we will find it on the spinner table. According to the hill on which the race is held. And if we had the same nationality as the flag on the hill, we would get more bonus meters. Which is like fans support us. So, after entering the values, you can jump. Jumping is made by putting your plastic figure down from the hill. At the edge of the hill there are two rollers which are triggered by the plastic figure and there have plus and minus symbol and numbers. These rollers simulate so-called random weather factor such as the Wind, or the current mental state of the jumper, etc. If we jumped +1 point. We will write down all those things in a notebook and in the final evaluation of the jump, in addition to the points gained in training, the place where the jumper finished will also be recorded. We have different point areas. The possibility of falling is incorporated into the game. If the jumper does not reach the point area or fall, he will not get any points. But he also has another way to get points for style as in real, and these are the cards that represent the points we know from ski jumping. The points work by dealing 5 cards to the player, he does not look at them. Another five cards are dealt in front of him, and after turning the hourglass, which has a limit of 30 seconds, the player tries to find the best possible numbers in order to get the best points for style. After matching the cards, the highest and the lowest value is deleted, as it works in real races. The remaining three values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;on the cards are summed up and written down in a notebook. All entered values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;are then summed up on a special designed notebook so you don't have to remember all you data and the winner gets one of the trophies.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
