Whoever hides the most treasures wins!&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of ten character cards and a starting supply of treasure: one book, one chalice, and a handful of signet rings that come in three types. A harbor with six storehouses is stocked with additional treasures, and three characters &ndash; Abbot Remigius, Vitus, and Prior Severus &ndash; are placed in the 13-room abbey.&#10;&#10;For the first round of the game, each player secretly chooses a character card, then they all reveal them simultaneously, with players then carrying out the actions on those cards in player order. Some characters represent monks who help you move through the abbey and hide treasure, others allow you to take treasure from the harbor, open a locked door while closing off another passage, or move treasure that another player has already stashed, among other things. When a player moves Abbot Remigius, the Abbot rewards all players who have stashed treasure in the room in which he ends his movement, with all of the treasure then being marked as scored &ndash; other than duplicate signet rings, which can score again should the Abbot return. (Vitus, who isn't controlled by a card, follows the Abbot closely to spy upon him, thus keeping the Abbot from returning to the most recent room he entered.) If the Prior Severus is in a room, though, the Abbot can't do his thing as Severus would then discover the treasure and learn of the Knights' actions.&#10;&#10;After the initial round, a player must play a character card that doesn't match the top character card on any player's discard pile &ndash; which means that you (and others) play both offense and defense with the same character card, restricting the action of others while ideally making good use of the character yourself. When a player lays down The Bells card, he picks up all of his played cards, then restocks the harbor based on the number of his previously played character card.&#10;&#10;When the harbor can no longer be filled properly or when a player has placed at least one treasure in each room, the final round is triggered, then players have a final scoring for their rings still in the abbey and for the number of rooms that hold their treasure.

Conflicting claims of sovereignty have roiled those &quot;near seas&quot; since the Cold War. After decades of patient diplomacy, Beijing's new navy could offer military options for finally asserting sovereignty over prizes within the First Island Chain - that string of islands which runs from the Ryukus south through Taiwan, the Philippines and then curls back to the mainland via Malaysia. BtC presumes that China comes to blows with a Southeast Asian country in a conflict that could expand to possibly include: Australia, India, Japan, the United States as well as a variety of Southeast Asian nations. However, beyond China and one South East Asian nation, the exact composition of opposing coalitions is not predetermined but rather a function of the decisions players make as the game unfolds.&#10;&#10;Two or more people play BtC with two reference cards, dice, and about 350 counters on a 22&quot; X 34&quot; map where each hex spans about 70 nautical miles (80 land miles) and each turn represents one day of real time. Players alternate maneuvering air, ground and naval units for up to 14 nations to resolve battles with a universal &quot;strike&quot; mechanism that applies across all types of combat; missile defense capabilities are central to survival. Air units represent from 30-90 aircraft each, most ground units are regiments, and naval units are small groups of surface ships/submarines or individual aircraft carriers. Specialized chit play simulates black ops, cyber warfare and various political developments.&#10;&#10;BtC is solitaire friendly. The naval operations which dominate play are based on a roll-to-evade model rather than search-to-find model. That means, owing to a battle space awash in electromagnetic emissions, enemy positions - except for motionless submarines - are assumed to be known unless a last-minute dice roll determines a potential target has evaded detection. So there is no &acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#156;hidden movement&acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#157; to stifle solitaire play; and the &acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#156;hidden placement&acirc;&#194;&#128;&#194;&#157; of submarines can be forgone. Finally, the special chits that govern black ops can be played at random to further enable solo game play.&#10;&#10;"

A play-at-home version was offered in 2005 at PentaCon through the R&amp;R/GuffeyConRevue booth.  The production version of the game came in a plastic clamshell containing cardstock figures and buildings. It also included a single  d6, d10, d12 and custom scatter die used for teleporting. In May 2011, a generous review of the game was offered in the Lost Game Safari column of the 'Knights of the Dinner Table' (issue 175) by Andy Miller.&#10;&#10;"

It takes about 30 minutes to play a full game, even with an 8 person game.&#10;&#10;Players choose a Warrior card (like Medusa or Puss In Boots) from their hand to represent them in battle, then multiple players must work together as a team to defeat the players on the other side of the table. They also use Item cards (like Excalibur or Flying Carpet) to get them out of a tight spot and turn the battle around! Each battle is also set on a Battlefield (like Beanstalk or Sleepy Village) and players can use the terrain to their advantage.&#10;&#10;The actual battle is conducted by players describing their character's action to the judge, who has final ruling on all matters. If it convinces the judge, it's fair game! After each battle, the role of the judge passes to the player on the current judge's left.&#10;&#10;"

R. of the Congo. It is one of the most popular mancala games.&#10;&#10;Songo is known for its rich orature of funny stories, which were recorded by the German anthropologist G&uuml;nter Tessmann (1884 - 1969) in 1907. The game is a popular mindsport in Africa. Songo competitions are held every weekend in Douala, Cameroon.&#10;&#10;The game is promoted by the minister for culture and art and the president of the Republic of Gabon, Mr Omar Bongo Ondimba. There are plans to teach Songo at all the schools of the country. Over 200 Songo masters (called &quot;nti&quot;) attend every year a huge tournament in Libreville.&#10;&#10;The Songo World Championship in the village of Oyop (South Cameroon) attracts famous players from many countries. The current world champion is the Gabonese Vivi Metou. Other strong players are Endel&eacute;, L&eacute;vy Megne-Masseko, Narcisse Nguema, Davy Obiang, Ta-Ndong, Moulouma, Kamsi, Romy Nguema, Zu&egrave; Allogo, and Desir&eacute; Meba Mefame.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Songo is played on a mancala board (&quot;mbek&quot;) of 2 x 7 holes. These holes are called &quot;nda&quot; (&quot;house&quot;). At each end there is a big store for the captured counters. Each house contains five stones called &quot;songo&quot; (&quot;pebble&quot;). A player controls the row on his side of the board.&#10;&#10;On their turn a player distributes the contents of one of their holes, one by one, clockwise into the ensuing houses. The leftmost hole of a row may only be emptied, if if contains at least three stones unless it would be the only possible move. However, the hole may be emptied, if the move results in a capture or if the opponent has (a) nothing left in their holes and (b) it isn't possible to feed them with three or more stones.&#10;&#10;If a hole contained 14 or more stones, it is skipped and all the player's own holes that follow. The remaining stones are only sown on the opponent's side. If the opponent has no stones left, they must be fed with at least seven stones. If this can't be done, they must get as many stones as possible.&#10;&#10;A player must move at their turn. If the last stone falls in an opponent's hole, which contained one, two or three stones, its contents are captured together with the last stone (ie. two, three or four stones). If the previous-to-last stone also brought an opponent's house to two, three or four, these are captured as well, and so on. If 14, 21 or 28 stones were sown, only the last stone can be captured, but nothing else.&#10;&#10;When a player has only one stone left in their row and this stone is in their leftmost hole, they capture it. If a move would captures all all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board. The game ends when a player cannot move. The stones that are still on the board are won by the player who moved last.&#10;&#10;The player who captured most counters wins. If both players captured the same number, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;"

They generate adrenaline to do things such as move, attack, and perform special actions like activating an objective space. That generation also has a negative effect for them, as that adrenaline transfers to the Overseer player, who then uses it to spawn aliens, create new threats, and hurt the soldiers' chance of success during the scenario. The more actions the Special Ops players take, the more resources the Overseer player has to work with.&#10;&#10;Characters in [Omega Protocol] are represented by miniatures, and each Special Ops and alien character has different attributes, powers, and customizable skills and equipment.&#10;&#10;"

Taking of opponent's pieces is limited to manoeuvring behind the other player's counters from the side; hence the name.&#10;&#10;Basic strategy involves the creation of temporary vertical or horizontal lines, as both of these patterns prevent to a legal take manoeuvre; the former prevents (in the short term) the opponent from being able get to the side, the latter the completion of a take because the rear of pieces are protected. However, such structures are not sustainable for long, especially as players lose pieces.&#10;&#10;"

However, unlike Go where placed pieces are static or captured, Mynd (the Welsh word for go) shows its diversity using a push/pull mechanic that allows lines of pieces to be moved along lines (horizontally or vertically), according to a simple tug-of-war mechanic. Therefore, this is more an ongoing battle that the traditional game, with the status of claimed territory being under constant attack as walled off sections of the board are pressured by force of numbers. The game ends when there is no legal move left, the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.&#10;&#10;As an additional game reusing the Go aesthetic, utilising the same general-purpose grid and colored stones, it is hoped this will join the variety of other abstract strategy games that can be played with a Go set, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.&#10;&#10;"
