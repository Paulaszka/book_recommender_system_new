To do that, you'll need to play the right animal at the right time while anticipating what opponents will play, too.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a hand of sixteen cards: four each of elephant, dog, cat and mouse, with those cards valued 1-4. One card of each type starts in the center of the table. Each round, players choose one card from their hand, then reveal them simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Which animals are chased away is determined through a &quot;rock/paper/scissors&quot; format, with dogs chasing away cats, cats chasing away mice, mice chasing away elephants, and elephants chasing away dogs. If you play the only dog, for example, you collect all cats on the table and all cats played that turn; if multiple people play dogs, the strongest valued dog wins; if players play dogs of the same value, then those are ignored and the next strongest dog wins. Any animals not collected stay on the table for the next round.&#10;&#10;Once all the hand cards have been played, players tally the value of the animals they collected and whoever has the highest sum wins!&#10;&#10;"

With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.&#10;&#10;For King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000-strong force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.&#10;&#10;On a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.&#10;&#10;Leuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy. This narrative contains many previously unpublished aspects of the battle and includes maps, diagrams, statistics and his analysis of the 1757 campaign in Silesia.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;       2nd edition standard series rules booklet&#10;       Special rules, scenarios &amp; historical commentary booklet (28 pages)&#10;       four 22 x 34 inch game map&#10;     2 countersheets with 280 counters each (Leuthen countersheet, BAR 2nd edition Markers countersheet)&#10;&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;    Units: Infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, artillery sections&#10;    Ground: 1 hex = 100 yards&#10;    Time: 1 turn = 20 minutes&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box and user's description)&#10;&#10;"

11127,,"&quot;Kursk: Operation Zitadelle, 4July 1943&quot; is the first wargame by SPI (or anyone else) on history's largest land battle.&#10;&#10;The stark four-color map extends 440 miles from north to south at about 9 miles per hex. Games last 6 turns. The time scale, though not stated, is probably two days per turn. (The historical battle ran 12 days.) Units are German divisions (light gray) and ahistorical Soviet &quot;corps&quot; (brown), plus a handful of smaller formations. They have combat and movement factors (e. g., 6-8 for the best German panzer divisions, 2-4 for a Soviet infantry &quot;corps&quot;). The Germans have several non-divisional panzer units that must be stacked with a German division in order to use their combat factor.  The Soviets have artillery and anti-tank brigades that can only use their combat factor in attack or defense, respectively.&#10;&#10;Four bands of fortified lines dominate the map, one German line and three Soviet lines. The Soviet fortified lines are indicated as they existed in May, June and July 1943.  All four lines are used during the historical scenario but not all of the Soviet lines apply to some of the hypothetical scenarios.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave). The stacking limit is three divisions or &quot;corps&quot;, plus one smaller formation, per hex. The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Supply lines must be traced over no more than 10 hexes to a rail line leading off a friendly map edge, with lack of supply halving movement and combat factors.&#10;&#10;Air power is represented semi-abstractly by air units that can fly close support, interdiction, combat air patrol, air superiority or interception missions. There are no command rules, but a couple of optional rules try to suggest organizational differences between the two armies. These options are quite advantageous to the Germans, who, as in reality, need all the help they can get. One of these optional rules is the ability of the German mechanized divisions to not be completely removed from play on an Eliminate result, but be replaced by low-strength Kampfgrupen (this became a standard rule in later games).&#10;&#10;The wargame includes six scenarios: historical and free setup scenarios for the historical July start date, hypothetical May and June German attacks, and two hypothetical August Soviet counteroffensives (one with a fixed and the other with a free setup). 255 counters&#10;&#10;For its day, Kursk: Operation Zitadelle was a &quot;monster game&quot; and more attentive to history than many of its rivals.

The land mines (pegs that move up and down through the base) are activated by pulling a lanyard that runs under the base and behind your command bunker.  Shells numbered 1 through 10 are hidden in your command bunker with higher numbered shells having more firepower.  Players simultaneously select one of their ten shells then both players lower the bunker to reveal the value of the fired shell.  The player with the higher value shell totals the value of both shells and moves the slide that number of spaces towards his opponent.  If the shells are of the same value, both are discarded and the tanks are not moved.  If the opponents tanks are moved back over the land mines, the player that had the higher total can pull on the lanyard.  If the opponents tank is moved, it is destroyed and is out of the game.  Both of the fired shells are then removed from the game.  The game is played in two rounds but tanks destroyed in the first round are not replaced for the second round.  The winner is the player with the most tanks on the battlefield after two rounds.&#10;&#10;"

The basic tiles are the Chi tiles, which are used to develop the flow of Chi across the board. They come in eight types: ten each of connecting tiles which take the chi energy from one edge of the square to one two or three other edges. There are a further eight Chi ending tiles, two each of four deigns which are needed to terminate unneeded Chi paths. There are also eight Sha tiles, two each corresponding to the the four Chi tiles. This can be placed upon the corresponding opponents tile and thereby blocking the flow. However, a player can overcome these blocks by using the Remedy cards, again two each corresponding to the four Chi tiles.&#10;&#10;Each player draws a hand of four tiles (called a reserve) and each turn they can place one tile on the 8 x 8 board. (This is decorated with a Maltese Cross, which it appears only has a psychological effect, as there is no reference to it in the rules.) Starting at the entrance to their respective palace, each player seeks to develop a flow of chi to the other side of the board. As they play a tile, each player can replenish their reserve from their stock. If they are unhappy with their reserve they can replace up to the entire four tiles of the reserve, which then constitutes the entirety of their turn.&#10;&#10;"

Both games are in the same box, using a single scenario book, and most of the same counters (many American and British units fought at both).&#10;&#10;The games adhere closely to the highly successful BAR rules system. The major change lies in the halving of the strength point ratio so that 1 point equals 50 men, 25 horsemen, or 1 cannon, accommodating the smaller battles and units of North America. This will, in turn, result in a doubling of stacking limitations (map and time scale remains the same as the other BAR games; 100 yards per hex and 20 minutes per turn). There is a noted lack of cavalry in both battles. The counters are in the same style as the other BAR games, but with some interesting variations (e.g., rifle frocks).&#10;&#10;Brandywine (four maps) has 4 scenarios: Knyphausen's attack at Chads Ford, Cornwallis' attack at Birmingham Meeting House (both one mappers), Howe's historical plan (comprising both Knyphausen's and Cornwallis' attacks), and an optional Howe plan. The latter scenario will allow the British player to select alternative schemes of maneuver to attack the Americans.  Washington, in turn, has the ability to gain intelligence on the British movements (both true and false information) and possibly readjust his force. &#10;Germantown (two maps) has 2 scenarios.

11170,,"This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more.  Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.&#10;&#10;There are 2 large ruins and 85 tiles of terrain in the base game.  Some terrain tiles are large (up to 24 hexes) while others are small (1 hex).  There are water, sand, rock and grass tiles (in roughly increasing order).  Many different battlefields can be built by attaching and stacking the tiles.&#10;&#10;The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version.  In the basic version (designed for younger players &lt; 8 years), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated.  The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.&#10;&#10;A battlefield/scenario book shows how to build five battlefields, layer by layer.  Each battlefield may have multiple scenarios, where the goals vary.  It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.&#10;&#10;Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.&#10;&#10;Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).&#10;&#10;The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.  It's possible to bring a &quot;pre-fab&quot; army to the battle in order to save time.&#10;&#10;The basic game is for two players. The master game is for 2 to 4 (and more) players.&#10;The game is eminently customizable, with many expansions which add more abilities, terrain, and options. There are also user-created maps, scenarios, custom units and advanced rules available online.&#10;&#10;HeroScape: Rise of the Valkyrie is the original master set for the HeroScape series of games.&#10;&#10;"

11179,,"The second game in the series that includes Imperator and Ultimus Romanorum: La Chute de Rome, Semper Victor offers a grand strategic view of the Fourth Century Roman Empire. The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).&#10;&#10;The map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.&#10;&#10;The opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed &quot;Primus&quot;) represents the senior Emperor (&quot;Primus Augustus&quot;) and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player (&quot;Secundus&quot;, misspelled &quot;Secondus&quot; in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)&#10;&#10;In the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.&#10;&#10;The Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., &quot;Constance Chlore&quot; for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for &quot;Capacit&eacute; de Commandement&quot; (number of units he can command), &quot;Capacit&eacute; Politique&quot; (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), &quot;Valeur Strat&eacute;gique&quot; (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and &quot;Bonus Tactique&quot; (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.&#10;&#10;Very important to play are &quot;stratagems&quot;, which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.&#10;&#10;Turns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs strat&eacute;giques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.&#10;&#10;Movement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacit&eacute; de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.&#10;&#10;Players tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.&#10;&#10;Players must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map. The rules are in French, though English translations are easy to find.&#10;&#10;"

But as the Union troops advanced on Corinth, the Confederates hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.&#10;GRANT MOVES SOUTH puts you in command of the Tennessee campaign.  As General Grant, you must combine river and overland movement to strike deep into rebel territory against the important points of Nashville, Corinth, Memphis, and Columbus.  As the Confederate General, A.S. Johnston, you must use careful maneuver and counterattacks to prevent the ever-growing torrent of Bluecoats from conquering Tennessee.&#10;&#10;GRANT MOVES SOUTH shows the critical importance of the road net, water movement and the abilities of individual division commanders.  The fog of war is thick as you know where the enemy is, but not how strong he is.  Gunboats attack river forts, and steamers whisk troops deep into enemy territory.&#10;&#10;"
