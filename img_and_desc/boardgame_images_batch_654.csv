The underlying theme is about recognising the pictures on the tokens, or matching the colours or creating a memory game with them. It indirectly teaches the youngest children to recognise and name colours of the rainbow while having a lot of fun. The dice with a colour on each side indicates which picture needs to be selected (or found from an overturned token). Granna have created many variations to this game.&#10;&#10;"

Has many models of play a few of which we review here.  More on our website.&#10;&#10;Story Play: The Simplest RoarStack game, for casual group play or children,  is Story Play wherein you relate your card to the previously played card, possibly within the optional theme of the round.  In Story Play, the added sayings and card value/suits don't matter, just the inkblots and the story. This is a good mode for young children and people more interested in collaboration and storytelling than the competition.&#10;&#10;Point Play: If you want to keep score and compete with others, then you can add the dimension of point play where victory points are scored based on phrase+value on the story cards when the conversation of the group matches the phrase. You play your victory cards at any time. Victory points can come from mundane things in the conversation from the weather, to social relations, to pop culture. Your inkblots and storytelling can help lead the conversation, but you don't score victory points from what you do/say, only from what your friends do/say.  This mode encourages talking with and listening to your friends and is great for party play. Even when it is not your turn to play a card, you need to pay attention and engage in dialog, maybe even trying to guide the conversation so you can score points. However, you also have to be active in the round to score so you have to keep that story going when it is your turn.  Victory scoring is generally simple -- you play the victory card in front of you so just count them at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;Gestour/Best play: A mode good for larger groups or big/noisy parties is Gestour/Best mode where everyone competes to try to extend the same story. A gestour is a teller of legendary tales. In this mode, the gestour starts a story and everyone picks a card from their had and tries to be the best extension of that story based on the inkblot on their card. After the cards to play are exposed, the gestour defines how they will define &quot;best&quot;. There is an optional 30 second free-for-all period where everyone tries to convince others that theirs is the best extension. The gestour then begins calling on players who have 10 seconds to tell their card's story. The gestour picks the &quot;best&quot; answer and that person becomes the new gestour. Everyone else draws a replacement card. The first person out of cards wins the hand.&#10;&#10;Twisted Play: Another mode of play is Twisted play, which is good for people who play traditional card games. In Twisted play, you use just the playing card deck, and play your favorite classic card game, with a twist -- you can use the inkblots to connect cards or as wild cards. For example, in Roaring Rummy you might connect a random card into a part of a straight by telling the inkblots' secret stories and connecting misfit cards to those before and after it in sequence. In Roaring Go Fish, when you pull a card from the pool you can also match it if you can tell the story to connect it to your matching card.  In Solitary Stories you can play any card anywhere, but only if you can tell its story. Here, the role of the stories is to directly help you score points in a classic game. These add RoarStack Story play to existing games, making almost any card wild by using your creativity. It adds a new twist and often a lot more laughter, to well-known games.&#10;&#10;Ideation Play: Another mode of play is ideation -- the generation of ideas related to solving a problem.  Here, the player(s) takes a problem to be solved and uses the cards to help explore the problem, the constraints, and potential solutions. RoarStack is not only a fun game; it can also be an innovation tool for improving creativity and problem-solving. Creativity in innovation and problem-solving is often about linking disparate ideas together. Given a topic, people see different things in the cards, and seeing things in the cards makes connections to other ideas. In the words of the very innovative Steve Jobs: &quot;Creativity is just connecting things.&quot;  Dr. Boult, one of the creators, has use it in multiple corporate innovation tranining sessions and in the classroom with significant results.&#10;&#10;Kickstarter edition sold out. Second edition printed in 2017 with new custom case and printed instructions.   THe second edition also modified some of the &quot;point&quot; questions based on user feedback from the first edition.&#10;&#10;"

A patrol had mistakenly reported a rebel camp ripe for raiding so Stone, in turn, ordered Colonel Deven to advance on the supposed camp. Having done so, Deven found nothing of the kind. Confused, he settled his men in a defensive position and awaited new orders. Stone decided to send the remainder of the 15th Massachusetts, With Colonel Edward Baker in command, across the river so that he might conduct a reconnaissance in force around Leesburg, VA. A sharp engagement ensued with Baker calling for more reinforcements. The army strength on both sides grew to approximately 1700 men.&#10;&#10;Colonel Baker was killed late in the afternoon during a failed attack on the rebel line. Before long, disorganized federal troops were recrossing the river. By early evening The 18th Mississippi arrived and aided in an assault that fully routed the boys in blue. Their artillery abandoned, many Union soldiers were forced down the steep slope called Ball's Bluff and into the river. Soldiers swarmed the waiting boats. Overcrowded, several boats capsized on their way back to Harrison Island. An untold number of Federals drowned in their desperate attempt to escape. By day&rsquo;s end, 223 Union men were killed, 226 were wounded, and 553 were trapped and captured by the advancing rebels. In all, the rebels lost 36 KIA, 264 WIA, and 3 captured for a total of 303 &ndash; killed, wounded and captured.&#10;&#10;Ball's Bluff is a hex-based, chit-pull system game using company sized units. It features low complexity rules and low counter density - 103 pieces. The map has been drawn by famed Civil War map creator, Rick Barber and covers the area immediately surrounding Ball's Bluff. The action represented covers only the heavy fighting which took place from the early afternoon on. Playtime, once the rules are understood will average two hours or less.&#10;&#10;"

If players succeed to defeat the monster, players can divide rewards but the player who played the lowest value will go first.&#10;&#10;Japanese summary:&#10;&#10;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#233;&#133;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#135;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#140;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#133;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#177;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#232;&#191;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#182;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#152;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#178;&#162;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#231;&#172;&#145;&#233;&#161;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#169;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#233;&#154;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#231;&#156;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#150;&#145;&#230;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

When everyone has chosen their character cards, the first player announces the characters one by one. When you hear your character, you reveal your character card and play your adventure, curse, or port card, and everyone gets involved in a new adventure, which usually ends with a grandiose sea battles, or some curse, or finding a new port.&#10;&#10;The pirate with the most booty wins the day, but a pirate's life isn't always on the up and up.

Note:  It is recommended the number of Playing Field hexes should not be more or less than one, from the numbers of players.  Example: If there are 6 players and only 3 Playing Field hexes, the game could get congested.&#10;&#10;Modified game (Number of Pawns/Cards per Person):  To make the game harder or easier, players can start off with more or less than 3 pawns.
