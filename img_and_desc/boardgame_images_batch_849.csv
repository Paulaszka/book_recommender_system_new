Can you stop the Elder Ones from awakening?&#10;&#10;In this 2-player asymmetrical card game, one player investigates several locations for indications of Cultist activity. Facing maddening dangers and grotesque specters, the Investigators duty is two-fold - find out what horrors lurk in the shadows and stop them. Be clever and investigate rumors to gather insight before the cult can awaken an Elder One.&#10;&#10;The Cultist sets perilous traps, summons fearful specters and casts reality warping spells to prevent the Investigator from discovering the secrets of the Elder Shadows.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a set amount of action during their turn to use as best they see fit. Will you draw cards or Investigate? Will you summon a Specter or set a trap? In a devious twist to standard card games, Elder Shadows implements a unique Sanity system making all cards more, or less, powerful based on the current Sanity level.&#10;&#10;Can you expose the Cult before they can open the gateway to unimaginable horror?&#10;&#10;"

The result of playing the game is an enhanced understanding of the basic financial tools commonly used in business. The participants make up a team of executives for a fictitious company (can also be played individually).&#10;&#10;The flow of the game is that each player or team of players make up a company that lives through a year in business, one month at a time. They run into many opportunities and some of those opportunities become obstacles if they do not respond to them correctly. And, the team has to deal with annoying things that happen in business like paying bills and dealing with an employee that steals from you or spending money on something that was not anticipated. Each month, the team completes that months section on a P&amp;L, Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash flows.&#10;&#10;During the process, players are interacting with our website, their team and other teams and all of these relationships have an effect on the outcome of the game. The team with the most profit at the end of the game (year) WINS!&#10;&#10;To start the game, the players must divide into teams. Each team being made of 1-3+ players. Teams can be bigger for large groups but 3 is the ideal largest team size. The teams name their company and roll dice to determine which side of the game board to play on (franchise vs. non-franchise) and from there, the players reference the &quot;play now&quot; section of the website to capture their region info to note on the main game board before they begin the first turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn equals a month in business. The game lasts for 12 months (1 year) but the first quarter (3 months) has already been completed so the teams actually begin in April using Jan-Mar as a template for how to proceed.&#10;&#10;Each team begins by rolling a dice to determine if they pull a &quot;sales&quot; card or a &quot;company&quot; card. Sales cards tend to lead to better results but not always. Following the instructions on the sales card, the team proceeds with completing the income sheet for that month. They then use those results to complete the balance sheet and then the cash flow statement.&#10;&#10;Finally, they check the economic health of the other teams in their community to see if they are growing or declining which effects their income for the following turn (month).&#10;&#10;This cycle continues in and through December where the winner is determined based on their total earnings, cash at the bank and owners equity.&#10;&#10;Despite all the financial terms the game is both realistic and fun to play for families or professionals.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The actions are: moving to neighbor tile, buying another villager, killing enemy villagers. Villager can move only to neighbor tiles (the tile which has common side).

On one tile can be placed less than 4 villagers. You can buy new villagers by gold. Bought villager is placed on tile, where is the other villager with gold. After death of the villager all his resources stay on the same tile, and everyone can take it. If that tile is not available, the resources go to bank.

(There&rsquo;s also fact cards, with actual facts relevant to the issues of the EU Referendum&hellip;ones neither campaign seemed to actually use.)&#10;&#10;In a Nutshell:&#10;Each player chooses a campaign (Leave or Remain) then cooperates with that campaign to defeat the other campaign. There are two primary game mechanics: (1) rolling dice to match symbols on cards that provide effects, and (2) using those effects to strategically place campaign tokens on a map (or remove your opponents). The campaign that claims a majority of the map first, wins. Players can also use effects to sabotage the opposing campaign.&#10;&#10;A Player's Turn:&#10;A player rolls argument dice and tries to match the symbols on the dice (representing arguments relevant to the EU Referendum) with the symbols on headline cards. Matching all the symbols on a headline card grants the player various effects--from advancing the player's side on the map (and thus winning over voters) to sabotaging another player (by blocking that player from rerolling, using wilds, or advancing that player's side on the map).&#10;&#10;The campaign that flips three of the five voting regions first--by placing three tokens on a region or through other game effects--wins the vote and the game.&#10;&#10;Brexit: The Board Game of Second Chances provides humorous content with accessible, quick-to-learn, but dynamic gameplay.

(A player can optionally draw a card from the deck prior to playing.) The round continues until no player wants to play. The last player who played a valid number leads the next round. If you get rid of all cards in your hand, you win the round and whoever first wins two rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;To play a prime number, take 1-3 cards from your hand and arrange them to create a single number by using all the digits on those cards. If the number is prime, your play is valid. For example, if playing &quot;3&quot; and &quot;5&quot;, you may arrange their order and play them only as &quot;53&quot; because &quot;35&quot; is not a prime number. To play three cards, all of the cards must have single digits on them (so you can't use &quot;10&quot; or &quot;12&quot;) and at least one of the cards must feature a &quot;play three&quot; icon.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#230;&#153;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#145;&#179;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#230;&#166;&#130;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;10&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#138;&#182;&#230;&#133;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#128;&#154;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#175;&#140;&#232;&#177;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#

But the determined attack of the Polish soldiers freed Bologna, ending the combat trail of the Polish forces in Italy.&#10;&#10;This game uses Taktyka i Strategia's 2nd World War &quot;WB95&quot; system.
