The cosmic forces of intuition and chance meet head on with the powers of observation and logic in this multilevel game for two players.

Until the last card is played, you will be hanging on the edge of your throne.&#10;&#10;Description:&#10;&#10;Pyramad is played on a 6x6 square grid using 92 square cards. Each card shows a pattern of four squares colored red, blue, or white; red and blue are the players' colors and white is neutral.&#10;&#10;On a turn a player either draws a card or plays a card (playing is required if a player has five cards in hand). A card can be played on an empty space or on the intersection of four cards, but the latter play can only be made if the intersection has fewer than three squares of the opponent's color.&#10;&#10;The object is to either place the single card on the sixth level of the pyramid or make it impossible for your opponent to play.&#10;&#10;"

Elemental magic created the world and went into slumber for centuries, leaving myths about dreadful and marvelous creatures ruling over the living. Everybody knows fairies and trolls are just stuff of legends, right? Wrong! A few weeks ago, an adventurer awoke a powerful dragon and triggered a chain of events leading to the destruction of an empire. Magic is returning in a world shaken by sudden chaos. Armies are assembling to repel the awakening creatures and seize power!&#10;&#10;In Drakerys, each player chooses a side, gathers miniature troops and takes the lead against other players in story-driven skirmish battles. The terrain setting as well as the victory conditions are laid out by a battle scenario all players agreed upon. The fate of warriors is determined through combat rules and some rolls of dice. As a war leader, you&rsquo;ll need tactical insight - and a bit of luck - to win!&#10;&#10;The Starter Box contains everything you'll need to discover miniature games and enjoy Drakerys. Two armies are featured with fully assembled miniatures: the Human Paladins of Irosia and the wild Orcs of Ashral.&#10;&#10;As the story begins, they are pitted against each other in a campaign to conquer a mysterious archipelago filled with danger, secrets about the magical events to come, not to mention countless treasures! The winning side will take an important advantage in the beginning war.&#10;&#10;The old world is about to crumble. It&rsquo;s a time of heroes. Will you be the king of tomorrow? Find out with Drakerys!&#10;&#10;The game uses classic fantasy army building with an fresh twist: players use a special Action Wheel to determine whose turn is it to play and what units can do. The same player can play several times in a row or execute glorious feats at the price of increased risks, or use a more cautions approach to moving his army. This unforeseen game mechanic sets a new vision in fantasy gaming strategies.&#10;&#10;"

While it is possible to defeat an opposing force with missile fire it will take quite a while compared to engaging in melee.  As troops take casualties, their morale will decline with one side usually routing from the field while the victor will usually only have a few losses.&#10;&#10;As for battlefield tactics, one thing you will find is that using multiple lines and a reserve, though creating a narrower front, will have an advantage over an army arrayed in a single battle line with no reserve.  Attacking with fresh troops against fatigued enemies will usually result in victory for the army with the fresh troops.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Overlord, playing the opposition forces, and the other players  play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories.&#10;&#10;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There are 4 maps included in the retail copy of the game, and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There are 9 scenarios in the base box.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Overlord gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, and cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives.&#10;&#10;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box.  The Overlord plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Overlord has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement.&#10;&#10;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Overlord wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Overlord has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.&#10;&#10;"

During the course of this expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (later known as The Madman and The Tyrant) assassinated the conquistador leading the expedition and the nobleman he propped up in his stead before taking over the expedition personally. Recognizing that El Dorado was a myth and that the only gold to be found was back in Peru, Aguirre declared himself Prince of Peru and changed the purpose of his expedition to overthrow the Pizzaros and take over the country for himself. Sailing down the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, Aguirre's expedition faced all manner of challenges in the form of disease, privation, navigation, lack of morale, and attacks from the natives, against whom Aguirre committed barbaric atrocities (there are portions of South America where Aguirre's name is still used as a curse today). Members of Aguirre's expedition discovered to their dismay that the most dangerous of all the challenges, however, was Aguirre's growing paranoia. One by one, Aguirre executed his own men when he grew suspicious of them, sometimes with cause, more often without. Ultimately, Aguirre managed to capture a Spanish fort before being besieged by government forces, when he was executed by one of his own men, one of the few survivors of his ill-fated expedition.&#10;&#10;In the game, players will take on the role of one of the unfortunate members of Aguirre's expedition. Their goal? To accumulate enough influence to overthrow Aguirre before they are executed in turn. In the end, only one player will survive Aguirre&rsquo;s paranoia. Only one player will be able to accumulate enough influence to overthrow him. Only one player will emerge from the depths of hell on earth to tell the tale of The Tyrant Aguirre!&#10;&#10;The principal game mechanics are role/action selection and set collection. Players will earn Influence (victory) Points through a variety of methods, including influencing prominent members of the expedition (the role/action selection part of the game), purchasing Supply Cards (the set collection part of the game), and overcoming thematic challenges. One of these challenges is the &quot;paranoia phase,&quot; in which one of the roles/actions is removed from the game every turn, resulting in a diminishing array of role/actions for players to choose from as the game progresses. The game challenges players to use reactive and adaptive strategy, as players must frequently shift and adjust what they want to do in the game according to the changing conditions of the game.&#10;&#10;Aguirre is a fast-paced game for 2-6 players and lasts 30-90 minutes depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;"

Each Don will work to make his family the most powerful crime family of the Broad City. Players will set up their smuggling rings, open brothels, control the casinos and gambling in the city, traffic with unlawful alcohol shipments, control the unions and bribe to politicians... But they must be smart enough to don't arouse too much suspicions in the incorruptible side of the law. Their guys can arrested in police raids and the district attorney might his eyes over their affairs.&#10;&#10;The mechanism of the game is based on area control and workers placement, allowing a higher level of interaction with the other players when each player defends his business and try to hinder his opponents.&#10;&#10;A game takes about 90 minutes and offers a lot of options to seize the victory. Will you bribe to politicians to control the crime underworld? Will you become into the new &quot;Capo di tutti capi&quot; by controlling the streets and the monopolizing the smuggling rings? or will you do it controlling the unions? All plays are different: 23 historic events (start of the World War II , end of the Prohibition, Capone arrest...) can modify each play and offer new targets, troubles and options. Nobody said that the thirties were easy years.&#10;&#10;&#10;Spanish description:&#10;&#10;En Broad City Affairs cada jugador representa un Don de una familia mafiosa en una turbulenta ciudad estadounidense en la d&eacute;cada de los 30. Cada Don trabajar&aacute; para llevar a su familia a ser la m&aacute;s influyente en la ciudad y as&iacute; ganar la partida. Para ello deber&aacute; establecer redes de contrabando, abrir negocios de alterne, controlar las casas de juegos, traficar con el alcohol ilegal, controlar los sindicatos, sobornar a pol&iacute;ticos&hellip; todo aquello que sol&iacute;an hacer los mafiosos por aqu&eacute;l entonces. Pero deber&aacute; ser suficientemente astuto como para no despertar demasiadas sospechas en los &ldquo;incorruptibles&rdquo; del lado de la ley, evitando que sus hombres caigan en redadas de la polic&iacute;a o que los fiscales pongan la lupa sobre sus asuntos. Por si fuera poco, las otras familias de la mafia luchar&aacute;n por el control del crimen en la ciudad y no estar&aacute;n demasiado dispuestas a compartir el pastel.&#10;La mec&aacute;nica de Broad City Affairs se basa en el control de zonas y la colocaci&oacute;n de trabajadores obligando a un alto nivel de interacci&oacute;n entre los jugadores y permitiendo que cada jugador defienda sus negocios y estorbe a sus oponentes.&#10;&#10;Las partidas duran aproximadamente 90 minutos y presentan muchas opciones para alzarse con el triunfo. &iquest;Te har&aacute;s con el control del mundo del crimen por medio de los sobornos a los pol&iacute;ticos? &iquest;Ser&aacute; el control de las calles y el monopolio de las redes de contrabando los que te convertir&aacute;n en el nuevo Capo di tutti capi? &iquest;O tal vez lo har&aacute; tu mano de hierro sobre los sindicatos? Adem&aacute;s, ninguna partida es igual que la anterior: 23 eventos hist&oacute;ricos (el comienzo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el fin de la Ley Seca, la condena de Al Capone&hellip;) podr&aacute;n modificar cada partida, ofreciendo nuevos retos diferentes en cada una de ellas. Nadie dijo que los a&ntilde;os 30 fuesen unos a&ntilde;os sencillos.&#10;&#10;"

The Prince of the country met Cinderella at the ball and fell in love with her. He decides he wishes to marry her and sets off to find her. Unfortunately, he doesn't actually remember anything about her and is left wondering aloud to all: &quot;Does anyone know Cinderella?&quot; Hearing this, many influential people begin spreading rumors that their servant is the actual Cinderella.&#10;&#10;In Too Many Cinderellas, players represent powerful people in the far-off country who are trying to influence the Prince's decision about who is the real Cinderella, pointing him towards their &quot;Cinderella&quot;. If anyone tries to spread misinformation about your &quot;Cinderella&quot;, you can just say &quot;NO!&quot; at the audience with the Prince. Many Cinderellas have gathered; who will be recognized as the real &quot;Cinderella&quot; by the Prince?&#10;&#10;In game terms, the deck of cards is shuffled and each player receives four cards. The person with the smallest feet starts first. A player wins a round when she has the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. To find the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella, each player lays down a card. The card dictates which card will be or won't be the real Cinderella. When a card is laid down, everyone secretly votes whether or not they want the new rule for that round. This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. In cases of ties, the winner is the player with the highest card.&#10;&#10;Game #3 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.&#10;&#10;"
