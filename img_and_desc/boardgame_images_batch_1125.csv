In this bluffing card game, your aim is to direct the attention of the Love Period characters away from yourself and onto other players. Lay any number of cards from your hand facedown in front of another player and name a character. The other player either accepts your statement or calls your bluff. If they were wrong, attention is directed towards them, so they place the cards in front of them. If they were correct, attention is drawn back to you instead, and you take the cards. The other player may also choose to pass on the cards to a third player instead, but they must first turn one of them faceup, keeping it beside them; if it matches any cards they've previously flipped from passing on prior turns, they must place all those cards in front of them. Gain too many cards of any one character and you die, losing the game while everyone else wins. However, if all players happen to survive by the time the deck runs out, the player who gained the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;"
