164543,,"An elegant game based off the traditional gambling game of the fierce and reclusive konog species, a secretive and xenophobic race from a remote corner of the galaxy. This game, enjoyed for years by the expeditionaries and pioneers in the Industrial Sectors, has only recently been introduced to the Core Systems.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to make a number of &quot;Konogs&quot;; which is either three cards of the same number of any suit, or a run (1, 2, 3) of three cards of the same suit. After playing a Konog, the fourth card left in your hand is placed in front of you, this is the value of that Konog. At the end of the game (after one player has performed a sixth Konog and all other players have taken one last turn) these values are added together (plus any triumvirates) to find the player's total ending score. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: you will need a large plate (or a rotating tray, like a Lazy Susan) to play Konog. As a player discards, many cards will make the discard piles (one for each player) rotate in different directions. Also included in the game are wooden &quot;sentries&quot;, you can place these on a discard pile to protect a card from being taken or covered up by another player.&#10;&#10;Konog has many features that set it apart from other games. Inside each game box you can expect to find: simple, yet elegant artwork featured on circular cards, a completely alien numerical system based on three (don't worry, standard numbers are featured at the bottom of each card for those that are unfamiliar with the Konog numeral system), colorful wooden pieces (a sentry and matching post for each player), and a drawstring bag to hold everything.&#10;&#10;"

Players have to build and treat patients at the same time, since the hospital is under constant expansion. There are many different kinds of patients and plastic blocks necessary to treat them. Designing the blocks is difficult because each player is responsible for one aspect of it: architect, engineer, contractor, nurse, facility manager or director. A poor design allows for earning more money but contributes to the hospital bankruptcy, in which case everybody loses the game. The gist of the game is to find a balance between the need to join forces and the greed for money.&#10;&#10;The game design is based on a research conducted with three healthcare construction projects in the Netherlands commissioned by Pioneering. The research found that hospital design is often over schedule due to the conflicts of interests between the multiple parties involved. The game reproduces some of these conflicts, such as the engineer wanting to build more pipes than needed whiles the architect wanting to build a high rise building. If the conflict is not resolved between the players, patient satisfaction drops, together with the hospital income. Playing the game is an opportunity to learn the importance and the difficulties of designing for healthcare performance while having fun with the artificial conflict enactment.&#10;&#10;"

Players attempt to play a single card, or a set of cards, each one must succeed the prior one played with a higher value, or greater amount of cards.

Players also have jokers that act as wild cards, used to complete the going out in a single run.&#10;&#10;The solitaire version works like the 2 player version, but a player plays both sides.&#10;&#10;There is also a competitive version that utilizes the same drafting mechanism, but tweaks how cards are played.&#10;&#10;"

Half of the ship's crew is loyal to the captain, but the other half is plotting to kill the captain and take control of the ship. Who will come out of this struggle victoriously?&#10;&#10;At the start of the game each player will receive a card. On this card is a unique role and a team indication (either red or blue). Many of the roles have some sort of special power. Players do not show their role card to others. Only one player will reveal his role immediately: this is the player which has the captain role (and who is on the blue team).&#10; The blue team wins if they succeed in killing all of the players in the red team. The red team wins if they succeed in killing the captain. However, as long as the blue player with the bodyguard role is alive, the captain cannot be killed by red players.&#10;&#10;The game plays in night and day phases, just like in Werewolf. In the first night, the captain and bodyguard will get to know each other. Also, the players on the red team will get to know each other, but only partially: one player on the red team is the team leader. This player will open his eyes (&quot;wake up&quot;) and will make eye contact with other red players one-by-one. This means that the red team leader knows who all of the red players are, but all the other red players will only know the red team leader but none of the other team mates.&#10;&#10;In the game, players are eliminated at night by roles that become active then (usually red players). Players are also eliminated by day, as at the end of each day usually one player will be nominated to &quot;walk the plank&quot; (and will thus be eliminated). The captain can never be nominated to walk the plank. There are various player roles which can perform special night and day actions. These actions include finding out more about other players, kill them, or protect them.&#10;&#10;What sets this game apart from Werewolf is that most of the night actions require the player performing them to actually touch the player to which it is directed. This not only makes it harder to kill players further away from you, it also increases chances that some kind of noise or movement will be felt by the other players (which have their eyes closed during the nights). This in turn gives players during the day 'evidence' to accuse other players of being on the red team, and thus a good candidate to 'walk the plank'!&#10;&#10;Intrigo shares game mechanisms with Werewolf (e.g., two teams that battle for victory, day/night phases, hidden roles with special powers) and BANG! (hidden roles and only one role is known to all players).&#10;&#10;The game is language-dependent: the texts on the cards are in the Dutch language, and currently there is only a Dutch rule set available.&#10;&#10;"

Your aim is to get all 5 of the collected fruits with different numbers (from 1 to 5). If somebody collected a sequence which does not meet these demands, they will get less points or none.

The game's full name is &quot;Heiji No Ran: Heiji Gannen (1160) (&#229;&#185;&#179;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#185;&#177;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#229;&#185;&#179;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#229;&#185;&#180; (1160), Heiji Disturbance: First Year Of Heiji 1160)&quot;. Stemming from resentments brought on by the results of the earlier Hogen no Ran in 1156, the Minamoto along with their Fujiwara allies attacked the Taira and attempted to seize control of the government.&#10;&#10;When Taira no Kiyomori left the capital on a pilgrimage, Minamoto no Yoshitomo (Kiyomori's ally in the 1156 conflict) and Fujiwara no Nobuyori took advantage of his absence to kidnap both the Tenno (Emperor) Nijo and the retired Tenno (or Ho, retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa. They imprisoned the two, burned their palaces, forced them to appoint Nobuyori as Chancellor, and executed Taira ally and Go-Shirakawa confidant Fujiwara no Michinori. However, Kiyomori was informed of their treachery and quickly returned to Heiankyo. His rapid return surprised the Minamoto and left them unsure as to how to proceed. The Minamoto were further confused when Kiyomori made a false offer of surrender to Nobuyori. The Minamoto ended up taking no action against a still gathering and vulnerable Taira force, and Kiyomori also managed to engineer a rescue of both Go-Shirakawa and Nijo.&#10;&#10;A strengthened Taira force made the first move, attacking the Minamoto in the Imperial Palace. Fujiwara no Nobuyori ran off but the Minamoto gave battle. Luring the Minamoto out with a feigned retreat, the Taira then occupied the palace, leaving the Minamoto with no avenue of retreat. Instead of trying to reclaim the palace, the Minamoto attacked the Taira's stronghold of Rokuhara in southeast Heiankyo. While Rokuhara would have been an easy target earlier, it had now been reinforced and proved too much for the Minamoto. Their forces eventually broke and scattered. Their leader Yoshitomo was later betrayed by a vassal and killed. While the fighting was of a relatively small scale, it had far reaching effects. With all opposition effectively eliminated, the Taira became the most powerful family in Japan and the first warrior house to exert a large measure of influence and control on the Imperial Court. However, they failed to kill off all the Minamoto heirs, something that was to come back to haunt them in 1180 when Kiyomori managed to have his grandson installed as Tenno...a move that provoked a chain of events that led to the Genpei War.&#10;&#10;The game shares its rules system with its predecessor, &quot;Hogen no Ran&quot;. Both games put an emphasis on the favored samurai tactics of the time-night attacks, torching the strongholds of your opponents, and misdirection. The map for Heiji no Ran expands upon the one for Hogen no Ran, including the southern portion of Heiankyo as well as the northern. This allows the fighting to take place all over the city as it did historically, particularly near the Taira's headquarters in Rokuhara. The game runs for 11 turns, taking the action from the 26th day of the 12th month (the day the actual fighting began) in the first year of Heiji to the 29th day (February 5-8, 1160, two turns per day with a night turn). Forces of the various factions are individual leaders with associated clansmen, rated for both troop strength and leader ability. Victory is determined by unit losses, possession of the Tenno/Ho, and occupation of certain locations. As with its sister game it does an excellent job of simulating the battle (in this case as recorded in the Heiji Monogatari (a gunkimono-'war tale'-written around the year 1200). Heiji no Ran plays well with a low number of counters, short completion time, and a well thought out game system with sufficient chrome. It's nicely balanced and an early, well thought out Minamoto strike will often bring victory.&#10;&#10;"

The players seek to build their own strength and destroy their enemies by killing their enemies' units and capturing and destroying their enemies' buildings, to achieve Heroquests and thus earn gifts, and to earn runes with unique effects. Each empire has its own, and different, unique ability, weakness, greater god ability, units, Heroquests and gifts. For example, the Darkness empire features trolls, the Mistress (Cragspider), shades, and the Hellmother (Kyger Litor), while the Sky empire has archers, the Emperor, phoenixes, and the Sun God (Yelm). These are not just the same units with different names, but also have different abilities, as do their buildings. Chaos has both different buildings, three greater gods (the Unholy Trio) and a different agenda to the other empires. The game has a world-shattering &quot;mythic&quot; feel to it rather than a &ldquo;fantasy adventure&rdquo; sensation.&#10;&#10;Glorantha: The Gods War is based on the vigorous mythic realm of Glorantha, which has been the basis for multiple tabletop board, roleplaying, and even digital games, as well as numerous works of fiction. Its depth and scope has been recognized by numerous aficionados of fantasy and gaming, and now it is brought to you in all its astounding power.&#10;&#10;In each round, in the Action Phase players spend the power they have earned from various sources, most importantly how many different types of buildings they have and the Heroquests they have achieved. They then spend power to build more buildings, summon and move units, do battle with enemy empires, and use powerful empire-specific abilities including from their earned gifts. The Council Phase may include an attempt to close the Chaos Rift that threatens the existence of the world and/or the Great Compromise in which an empire may sacrifice power for the greater good and to distribute victory points.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by obtaining victory points from various sources, most importantly the number of buildings controlled each round, paired Heroquests achieved and the Great Compromise, and from runes.&#10;&#10;"

The full name is Mimikawa No Tatakai: Otomo (Tawara) X Shimazu (Takajogawa No Tatakai) 1578.11.12 (&#232;&#128;&#179;&#229;&#183;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;: &#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#143;&#139; (&#231;&#148;&#176;&#229;&#142;&#159;) X &#229;&#179;&#182;&#230;&#180;&#165; (&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#229;&#183;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;) 1578.11.12, Battle of Mimikawa: Otomo (Tawara) Vs. Shimazu (Battle Of Takajogawa) 1578/11/12).&#10;&#10;Historically, the battle took place in Hyuga province (in the eastern part of Kyushu, Japan's southernmost major island). The Shimazu's increasingly expansionist ways were making the daimyo (feudal lords) in the north of Kyushu uneasy. Otomo Sorin of Bungo province in northeast Kyushu put together a&#227;&#128;&#128;sizable army and sent it south to deal with the Shimazu. The Shimazu in turn dispatched reinforcements north to their outpost at Taka castle. Shimazu Iehisa, Yoshihiro, and Yoshihisa consolidated their forces (along with some troops from their allies in the Ijuuin) at Taka, numbering about 50,000. The Otomo forces dispatched to meet them were made up of about 30,000 troops mainly from the Tawara, Takita, Saeki, and Kuwano families. They were commanded by Otomo Sorin's son-in-law, Tawara Chikataka. On the 12th day of the 11th month of the sixth year of Tensho (December 10, 1578) Tawara made an unwise frontal assault on the castle. After some bitter fighting featuring some of the earliest usage of large numbers of arquebus in Japan, the Otomo forces broke. The Shimazu pursued and many of the Otomo were drowned in the rapid waters of the Mimikawa river to the north. The Otomo lost about twice as many men as the Shimazu, probably about 4,000 or so. The Shimazu continued to push the Otomo back in the ensuing months, eventually forcing the Otomo to request aid from Toyotomi Hideyoshi, giving the warlord and his massive army a handy excuse to add Kyushu to his list of conquests.&#10;&#10;The battle is played out in eight turns. Victory is determined by both enemy casualties and possession of Taka Castle. Special rules account for the Otomo cannon (a rare instance during the Sengoku of cannon being used in the field). Counters are rated for morale, combat strength (melee), and marksmanship (in this case, the arquebus). While the Otomo have the numerical advantage in overall combat strength and counters and a couple of cannon, the Shimazu have better morale and more leaders, making things more or less even. An enjoyable play that rewards individual skill.&#10;&#10;"

We will rekindle these mortals' faith - through FEAR!&quot;&#10;&#10;Monstrous is a game of gods and monsters, fear and faith, dexterous skills and tactical combos.&#10;&#10;Players are Greek gods throwing mythical monster cards from their hand onto a shared tableau of ancient Greek locations to gain as much 'Faith' as possible. But a strong guiding hand is not enough - cunning use of tactical monster and location powers is the key to gaining the most faith of all the gods, and the favor of Zeus.&#10;&#10;During setup, a number of large location cards equal to the number of gods are arranged on the table - these are selected from 12 ancient Greek cities where the insolent humans cower. Locations have special powers and provide Faith when hit by Monsters. Depending on the number of gods playing, each god has a randomly constructed deck of between 7 and 10 out of 12 mythical monster cards, each with their own special power. Each god shuffles and readies these decks, then draws 3 of their monster cards ready to throw at locations and monsters already on the table.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a god chooses a single monster from their hand, and throws it (without their hand crossing the table edge) attempting to hit:&#10;1. a location - to use its special power, and any thrown monster power that affect locations, and gain its Faith.&#10;2. other monster cards on the table - to use the special power of their thrown monster on the other gods&rsquo; monsters. &#10;3. ideally both at the same time!&#10;&#10;Look for the best cards to throw and the best targets to throw at. But beware: monsters may do unpredictable and dangerous things. Some monsters even act like traps on the table, taking effect as soon as they are hit. If Olympus is in play, powerful legendary monsters can be gained for gods to throw too.&#10;&#10;Once a god has finished their turn, they draw a new monster and play proceeds to the next god. This proceeds until one god runs out of monster cards completely. Each other god then takes 1 final turn before the god with the highest Faith is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Monstrous blends stunning art of mythic Greece with quick card throwing, fist pumping action and the tactical combos that gods and gamers love. Every game is different and there are optional rules to tailor your MONSTROUS experience for children, team play and longer games with legendary monsters.&#10;&#10;And yes, you can release the Kraken.&#10;&#10;"

This Deluxe edition supports 2-8 players out of the box.&#10;&#10;&#10;Roll For It! is a casual, family-friendly dice and card game. Each player starts the game with six dice of a single color, and three target cards are laid face-up on the table. Players take turns doing the following: On a turn, a player rolls all of their dice not already on cards, then places any dice that match the targets on the corresponding cards. (Alternatively, before taking her turn, a player can first choose to reclaim all of their dice from all cards.)&#10;&#10;If the player now fulfills the target with their dice &ndash; e.g., a pair of 3s, a quartet of 6s, or a specific combination of numbers &ndash; they claims the card, takes back their dice (and returns any other dice on the card to their owner), then places a new card on the table. Each card is worth a certain number of points. The first player to earn forty or more points wins!&#10;&#10;"

All thanks to Demoralizer, a love battle where no holds are barred.&#10;&#10;This card game by Krzysztof Miller overcomes the classic scheme of game for couples, and makes a perfect example of playing with the form and breaking stereotypes. The game can be played by 2 &ndash; 6 people, who have only one goal &ndash; to demoralize the opponents. Each player takes the role of one of the six available characters: Blondi, Gangster, XXX Actor, Vamp, Scientist, or&hellip;  Grandma. Each character is described by four indicators: sex appeal, composure, cleverness, and morality. The level of these features, however, can be changed while playing the game by the action of cards, which players use during gameplay, as well as a direct result of actions taken by the opponents. To perform a successful pickup, thus depriving the other player his morality points, the level of attacking player&rsquo;s sex appeal must be higher than the composure of defending player. Only adequate calculation and analysis of indicators&rsquo; levels can protect a player against demoralization.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into players&rsquo; turns. Each player&rsquo;s turn is divided into six phases: discarding, drawing, activation, playing cards, seduction, and final phase. During the playing cards phase, players play on the table their cards from hand: action, helper, item, event or skill. To do this, however, a player has to pay the cost with his cleverness points. In addition, the character cards determine how many cards of a particular type the player can handle. Seduction phase is optional. A player may, but don&rsquo;t have to, try to attack any number of opponents during his turn. Futhermore, a player can attack not only with his character card, but also with helper cards, if he has got them. The same applies to defense.&#10;&#10;When the level of player character&rsquo;s morality drops to zero, that player loses and he is automatically eliminated from further play. The game continues until only one player remains and becomes the ultimate demoralizer.&#10;&#10;Demoralizer is a game for those who in the heat of battle do not forget about strategic thinking. Thanks to unique characters&rsquo; features, playing each of them requires a slightly different approach. The differences in the attributes determine strategy - sometimes player's attacks will be more frequent, or on the contrary - he will have to raise composure level and wait for the right moment to pickup the opponent.&#10;&#10;The average gameplay takes approx. 30-45 minutes.&#10;&#10;"

The game starts with a draft to fill the 18 man squad with every player having their abilities. Players alternate performing actions by activating one of their footballers. The game simulates almost all possible real life situations from fouls, throw ins and corners to penalties, injuries, hand balls or yellow and red cards.&#10;&#10;Attribute test are made in one of two ways (agreed before kick off):&#10;1. By rolling a 20-sided die&#10;2. By flipping the top card of Your &quot;fate&quot; deck.&#10;&#10;The first thought of this game was in April 2013, but not until February 2014 that I found the mechanics that I want to use to fuel my ideas. After that a working prototype has been made, and during several test the game had gotten a good reception. Now it's in a very advance test shape.&#10;&#10;Recently a 4th prototype version was printed with minor changes in game mechanics, and with prototype card layouts, and new game board preparing the title for release.&#10;&#10;"
