A player cannot choose an axis that another player has chosen. Once all the players have made a selection, the mirror is inserted in turn into each chosen axis. The player who chose a particular axis decides which direction the mirror should face when inserted into that axis. The axis scores for the player who chose it. Each green sphere adds a point, and each yellow sphere subtracts a point. The player also adds points equal to the difference between the number of red and blue spheres.&#10;&#10;Play continues with a new card. The game ends when one player reaches an agreed-upon point total.&#10;&#10;"

Meloche.&#10;&#10;The game map consists of 26 planets (one starting with each letter of the alphabet).&#10;&#10;Players start with one planet, and a small force of ships.  They occupy/conquer planets, collect and trade resources, build ships, supply their planets and attempt to discover Battleship technology.&#10;&#10;Players are eliminated when their home planet is conquered, and victory is achieved through the elimination of all other players.&#10;&#10;The Future Art of War includes a creative movement mechanic which adds to the &quot;fog of war&quot; effect.  Ships travel from planet to planet via &quot;hyperspace&quot;, and a chart indicates the number of turns (1-6) required to travel between each pair of planets. When a ship departs for a planet, the controlling player secretly writes the first letter of the planet and the number of turns required on the bottom of the ship counter, and places it on the first space in the hyperspace track.  Each turn, all ships in the hyperspace track move one space further down the track, and, when a ship has reached the appropriate space, the controlling player reveals the ship's destination.  Therefore, while players know how many ships their opponents have in hyperspace, they do not know the ships' destinations, or when they will arrive.&#10;&#10;The components of this game are quite good for a self-published game.  The map is poster-quality, and the cards, reference sheets, and money are comparable to many commercially published games.  The one component that clearly identifies the game as &quot;self-published&quot; is the ship counters, which are cut rectangles of flat plastic.  These, however, with a whiteboard marker, serve the &quot;hyperspace&quot; mechanic very well.  The game is packed in a large tube.&#10;&#10;"

In each round, a planet is picked. Players then try to conquer that planet by deploying the largest amount of troops. A conquered planet earns victory points. When Coruscant, the galaxies capital planet, is conquered, the game ends and the player with the highest victory point total wins.&#10;&#10;Troops are represented by cards; each card has one of six colors and a number from 1 to 5 on it. A set of cards of the same color can be deployed as the force trying to conquer a planet. The total sum of the numbers printed on these cards is the troop's strength. The strongest army wins the planet, earning 2 to 4 victory points for the player who deployed that army.&#10;&#10;Since the game is based on 2008's &quot;Clone Wars&quot; animated TV series, some characters from the series are featured as &quot;generals&quot;. For each color, there is a Jedi/Sith leader or general that can be earned during the game and then played to add a +3 troop bonus. Available leaders are Commander Cody, Yoda, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker, Asaj Ventress and Obi-Wan Kenobi.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players rally new troops from the card deck to conquer the next planet.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is rather quick and simple, strategic options are limited, and some luck is involved in getting matching colored cards from the card deck.&#10;&#10;There is an alternate name for this game: &quot;Sith gegen Jedi&quot; (Sith vs. Jedi).&#10;&#10;"

The two-player game pits the players head to head where the 4-player game has two players per team working as a partnership.  Each player starts with 7 cards, replacing cards played with cards from the deck and the game comes to an end after one run through the deck.&#10;&#10;The cards are divided into attacking cards eg. Pass, Dribble, Shoot, defending cards eg. Tackle, Save, referee cards, eg. Offside, Penalty, and wonder cards, eg. Wonder Goal, Wonder Save.  The side with possession aims to build up a series of attacking cards leading to a shot thundering past the opponent's keeper, the defending side tries to get possession with a tackle or to get the keeper on the end of the shot with a save card.  Tackles have the risk of being countered by a referee dishing out a yellow or a red card or even a penalty which can only be saved by a Wonder Save.&#10;&#10;The game plays in under half an hour and makes for a good filler especially with football fans.&#10;&#10;"
