In the game, a class of international students are ferried over to a deserted island by a teacher on a field trip.

Once the students awake on the island, their biggest fears are realized: There is only one way off the island - to be the last one standing. Kill or be killed, true survival of the fittest.&#10;&#10;Intended as a party game, Survival of the Fittest mixes together hand-management and bluffing of Bang! with the second guessing and alliances of Werewolf, bringing in up to 12 players to play as twelve of the fourteen unique characters which are dealt out randomly (along with a starting weapon) to the players.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players secretly (or openly!) choose one of the twelve map co-ordinates to go to that turn, each space giving different advantages (an extra health, a new melee weapon). However, once there, it's time for action! Players ally together to take down other players before turning on their friends. Killing an opponent allows the player to take the weapon, strengthening their own position and in turn making themselves more of a target. However, hiding like a coward is an acceptable tactic, as players can only attack others in the same co-ordinate. With plenty of meta-gaming and whispering going around the table, you can never be sure who to trust!&#10;&#10;As the game goes on, co-ordinates get randomly taken out of play to close down the areas and force confrontation until only one player remains - the fittest, the survivor.&#10;&#10;Designed by Luke Morris and published by Games On The Way, Survival Of The Fittest aims to push itself head first into the big group and party game genre.&#10;&#10;"

Magenta 1859 recreates it using the same rules as Solferino 1859 and Reichshoffen 1870, as well as the same scale (one hour per turn, 600 meters per hex, brigades). Unlike its siblings, the game has almost no special rules.&#10;&#10;Napoleon III commands the French and, though scarcely comparable to his uncle, well overmatches the Austrians' sluggish and late arriving Count Gyulai. Unfortunately for the French, Napoleon enters far away from the bulk of his forces and takes a long time to get within command range. Until then, formations may move effectively only when their commanders make successful initiative rolls, and the largest French corps suffers from an initiative penalty for the first several hours. (Its commander, General Mac Mahon, moved slowly while waiting for a Sardinian division to come up to cover his open flank. This caution did not, however, prevent him from becoming the hero of the day. The Emperor rewarded him with the title &quot;duc de Magenta&quot;.)&#10;&#10;The battle starts at 10:00 a.m. and lasts 10 turns, with many brigades not arriving until the afternoon. The forces (and the map) are only about half the size of those in Solferino, and the victory conditions are simpler: Each side gets one Victory Point for each hex it holds in the town of Magenta (which has three) plus one for each demoralized enemy corps.&#10;&#10;"

The result will seem familiar to players of these first games, but in many of the mechanisms and details there has been change.&#10;&#10;The changes have made for standardized systems, which are both easy to teach and remember in play. The text is clearer with more and better examples. It has also been organized by a group of players like yourself, so hopefully finding information in a hurry will be easier.&#10;&#10;BoF II continues as a leading miniature skirmish game, for games of Squads up to reinforced Platoon level from WW2 to present day. It includes rules for all manner of infantry and vehicle operations. There are additional optional rules to further enhance the gaming experience.&#10;&#10;The rules are aimed to create as authentic a battlefield experience as possible, players are encouraged to utilize real life battlefield strategies and tactics as these will give great success.&#10;&#10;BoF II continues using a similar system as Baptism of Fire and Wild Fire to create a highly interactive, unpredictable, yet the player can try and exert a degree of control and planning to implement his strategies and tactics.&#10;&#10;"

By means of road/track tiles stages can be built to simulate real or imaginary cycling events. Movement is modified roll-and-move with some additional rules for breakaways and closing gaps (as a simulation of slipstreaming). The characteristics or qualities of the cyclists/riders are represented with 'speed counters' that can be used to replace or in addition to the dice. Teams should generally have a balanced mix of riders with different specializations represented by different sets of speed counters.&#10;&#10;A 'beginners' game' and rules for time trials, team time trials, and some advanced and optional rules are included with the game, but given the flexible nature of the game, players can easily make further adaptations to simulate their favorite cycling event. To further explain the most complex rules, a series of picture tutorials can be found in the 'rules forum' here.&#10;&#10;RCT is not a short game. It is recommended to play at least 5 stages in a single game, and with 2 experienced players, that would take between 2 and 3 hours. More players and more (and/or longer) stages make the game longer, smaller teams make it shorter but have a negative effect on possible team tactics. However, RCT is played stage by stage, and it would be easy to play different stages on different occasions.&#10;&#10;The game is a free download.

Taking turns each player tries to find a matching 'Crazy Creature' which matches the Hide and Seek card.  If a player successfully finds a match they can move 'IT' one space closer to their opponents Gotcha circle.

Attach MR. IT to his stand and place him on the start facing the yellow end of the playing strip.&#10;3. The player at the yellow and of the playing strip takes the eight HIDING PLACE cards with the yellow sky and places them lace (CRAZY CREATURE SIDE) down spread out in a straight line in front of him.

The top Crazy Creature card is turned over, showing the players which creature they are looking for, and the game i.e. ready to begin.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;The player on the yellow side of the playing strip starts by reaching over and turning one of his opponent's HIDING PLACE cards over to find the Crazy Creature of the same colour as on the card in the centre.

The player on the blue side now turns one of his opponent&rsquo;: HIDING PLACE cards to find the same Crazy Creature.&#10;When a player turns a HIDING PLACE card and finds the matching Crazy Creature, he yells YOU'RE IT and turns MR. IT to face his opponent and moves MR. lT one step towards his opponent's CAUGHT YOU space. The hiding place card is left face up. He then turns over a new Crazy Creature card in the centre and goes again, looking for the next Crazy Creature.&#10;If all 8 Crazy Creature cards in the centre have been turned over before MR. IT gets to a CAUGHT YOU space, the Crazy Creature cards are re-shuffled and placed face down between the players.

In reality the conflict was averted by the French need of British support against German aggression, but in Admiral it blooms out with a major naval engagement around southern Africa.&#10;&#10;Each player controls three ship fleets, consisting of submarines, destroyers and cruisers. Each fleet has a command ship and a command base. If the command ship is sunk or the base is invaded the entire fleet is destroyed and its ships removed. Each player also controls a battleship which commands the entire fleet, and a corresponding fleet base. Sinking the opponents battleship or invading his fleet base wins the game.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player may move one ship from each fleet or forgo moving one fleet in order to move the battleship instead. Ships move along the corners of the hexes, submarines in the hexes.

Each turn a player flips one tile from a center pool.  If it fills an opening in their predefined set, they keep it and take one (and only one) more turn.  If not, they turn it back over.  First player to fill their whole set wins.&#10;&#10;The two turn limit makes this more suited to very young children than traditional memory games, as there's never too many recently-flipped tiles to track.  Most of the time there's either zero or one, since rejected animals are usually quickly picked up by the next player in line.&#10;&#10;Claims that the game helps with sequencing skills are based on the endgame, when the winning player calls out each of their animals in order, aping the book series' style.
