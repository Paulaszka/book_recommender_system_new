The clouds became hiding places for Speakeasies, black market dealers, and much more unsavory activities. As a result, the Sky Patrol was created to help keep the peace. In an attempt to avoid being arrested during a recent &ldquo;job&rdquo;, you have accidentally wrecked your airship along with a few unlucky others. Fix your airship as quickly as possible to avoid certain incarceration!&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll dice trying to match them to a type of component (using simple icons). Once you know what it looks like, you search for a token that has the same icons, trying to recover a piece of your airship. Once recovered, airship components grant special abilities like making your turns easier or even griefing opponents.&#10;&#10;Not all the tokens are useful. Most of the time, the player will select a token that is of no use to them and place it back in the pile. Memorization skills are necessary to ensure a player doesn't needless pick up the same token again and to remember where opponents have placed tokens the player needs. But with the special abilities that can be earned, the tokens can be shifted multiple times per game.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect all of their tokens to complete their airship wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

After all cards are down, they are turned over simultaneously.&#10;&#10;This is called a match and the winner of the match is determined by who has the higher rank.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest ranking card moves his pawn in his suit color to the corresponding number on the crosswalk.&#10;&#10;The other players then compare their rank values with the lead players rank, the difference between them, is where the other players move their pawns to.&#10;&#10;Example: The lead card is Red-7 the other players cards are Green-6, Blue-4, Yellow-4. Now the difference between Green-6 and Red-7 is 1, so the green pawn is moved to the #1 spot. The difference between Blue-4 and Yellow-4 to Red-7 is 3 so the Blue and Yellow pawn are moved to the #3 spot.&#10;&#10;Players then play all remaining cards in their hands in the same manner, any players left with cards after one of the other players have none, must discard their remaining hand to the discard pile face down.&#10;&#10;Now you return to The Deal, when the stock is empty the discard pile is made into the new stock.&#10;&#10;The game stops when the stock and discard pile are empty then you score the round.&#10;&#10;The Score&#10;The game is played in 3 rounds.&#10;&#10;The numbers on the crosswalk are also the scoring track, so (1=10) (2=20) (3=30) (4=40) (5=50) (6=60) (7=70) (8=80) (9=90) (10=100)&#10;&#10;The number on the crosswalk that your pawn is on after the game stops is your score for that round.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score after 3 rounds is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;A two player game&#10;&#10;All the rules are the same as in a four player game except as follows.&#10;&#10;At the start of a two player game, players decide which two of the four color suits they are going to play and which two corresponding pawns are theirs to move and to score with. Use the higher score out of the two pawns at the end of each round.&#10;&#10;A three player game&#10;&#10;From the deck decide which suit of the four color suits to discard, also discard the pawn of that corresponding suit color, these cards and pawn are not to be used in the game. You should now have a deck of 30 cards in three suits and three pawns to play with. From this point on, all the rules are the same as in a four player game.&#10;&#10;"

The order in which the players&rsquo; vice presidents are deployed is determined by a closed-fist auction.&#10;This is the main phase. Players will move their drill crews are at a rate of one per round (there are four rounds before Phase 2). Depending on the position of your vice president, if you deployed him to act in this phase, you can corrupt opposing drill crews (in order to attract them to the same tile as your active drill crew) or hire a subcontractor (to increase your drilling power).&#10;Each tile of the earth's crust has a value indicating its resistance to drilling. If the sum of the drill crews who are present equals or exceeds this value, the tile is excavated and turned over; then draw an Extraction card to see what resources you discovered, which is evenly split between the players who participated in the drilling. The indivisible remainder goes to one of those players (prioritized by whoever has a mine on the tile, then the player who has the greater drilling power, then the one who ttriggered the drilling).&#10;Finally, after the four rounds, the mines laid on drilled tiles provide the resources printed on the back of the tile.&#10;Players with a vice president here can perform market transactions, which is to say that they can buy or sell resources.&#10;In this phase, players can make investments to get renown points and improve their drilling conditions in different ways&hellip;&#10;augment the drill crews&rsquo; power (maximum = 4),&#10;place mines in the game &#226;&#128;&#168;(maximum three mines),&#10;improve mine safety (in order to avoid wasting resources at extraction time),&#10;improve the movement of drill crews.&#10;&#10;"

Just like in any zombie story the object of the game is to survive the zombie apocalypse. Before you begin, you set up the Zombie Cards in this nifty &quot;Z&quot; shape and pick your Survivor Card to represent you in the game.&#10;&#10;Everyone is dealt 5 cards that are a random set of weapons, some of which offer a utility function, but ALL of them can be used to Attack Zombies and other Survivors.&#10;Zombie Shuffle cycles between a Night Phase, where you must defeat incoming zombies, and a Day Phase that offers the opportunity to prepare for the next zombie attack. The game begins when the first zombie in the &quot;Z&quot; is flipped. Survivors must Attack the zombie with ANY 2 through 10 card corresponding with that zombie's suit.&#10;&#10;The winner keeps the Zombie card to track their number of kills. If a player does not lay down a card corresponding with that zombie's suit then they are considered Attacked and either lose equipped armor or become a zombie!Before the next zombie card is flipped, Survivors can use the Zombie Cure, Equip Armor (which protects from Attacks), Steal another Survivor's Weapons/Supplies or may instead decide to Attack another Survivor.&#10;&#10;Just like Attacking a Zombie, the Attack Card must correspond with the Survivor you're Attacking. If a Survivor is a Zombie and loses one of these battles then they are Dead for the remainder of the game. The other Survivor gets to keep their card, again to track their number of kills, and scavenge the dead player's cards.&#10;&#10;The Day Phase ends when  everyone has had a chance to play a Utility or Attack Card and everyone has drawn enough cards to have 5 cards in their hand again.&#10;&#10;The winner is the Survivor with the most kills at the end of the game. This has been a quick rundown of the game play and there are a few more awesome quirks to Zombie Shuffle not listed above. (For example, each Survivor has a unique Melee Weapon that can give them a Power-Up when equipped.&#10;&#10;"
