A card showing an initial setup is drawn. All players start with the same setup by placing tokens (numbers or colors) on their own boards as shown on the setup card. Next, each player tries to finish his own sudoku as quickly as possible. The fastest player of the first round has to play the next round with the highest handicap, the slowest player with the lowest handicap. The different handicap levels are shown on the setup cards. Winner is the player that manages to be the first to complete his/her own sudoku board.&#10;&#10;Then there's the Sudoku Sandokan type of play. In this variant, all players play on the same board. The goal is to get the board as full as possible. At first an initial setup is made based on what's shown on a setup card that is randomly drawn. The remaining tokens are then divided between the players. Each turn has to timed, so that each players has to place one or two of his tokens on a correct position on the board within half a minute. Failing to place a token correctly within the allotted time means that the player has to discard one of his tokens. A player scores a single point upon completing a single row, column or block. Completing two items (row+column, row+block or column+block) with a single token gives 2 points. Completing all three (row+column+block) with a single tile scores 3 points.

The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army.

If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on your unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).&#10;&#10;After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.&#10;&#10;When one army has eliminated half of the other's original deployment value, that battle round concludes the game, and the player who has defeated the greatest total point-value of opposing units is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

By laying out cards, a player collects point cards that are already present. This is how the dragon collects treasure cards, for example, but the third dragon hunter defeats the dragon, while a second knight protects the princess.
