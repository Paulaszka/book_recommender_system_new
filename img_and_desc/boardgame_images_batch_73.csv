8338,,"&quot;Elemental Wars&quot; is a non-collectible fantasy card game. It is played with a deck of 40 cards, 10 for each of the Element (Fire, Water, Air and Earth) with a Strength ranking from 10 to 1. The strongest cards (Strength from 10 to 6) have a Fame score of 11, 10, 4, 3 and 2 points.&#10;&#10;The classical version is played in four, with the persons sitting in front of each other forming a team (but in the booklet there are variants for different numbers of players).&#10;&#10;Before the game begins, one of the four players shuffles the deck and places it in front of the player to his left who must &quot;cut&quot; it. The dealer then distributes three cards to each of the four players (either singly or all three at once), in a counterclockwise rotation, beginning with the player on his immediate right.&#10;&#10;He then uncovers the thirteenth card and places it prominently in the center of the table. This card, regardless of its rank, identifies the Elemental plane on which the Tournament takes place: the Dominating one. The remaining cards are usually placed, face down, as a stack on top of the Dominating card, but not obscuring it.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the player to the dealer's immediate right, and goes around the table until the dealer has played last. Each round of four cards played constitutes a round of tournament. The winner of each rounf gathers all four cards and places them, face down, on his side of the table&#10;&#10;The winner of each hand is determined by the Strength and the Element of the cards. The winner is the player that dropped the strongest card of the Element that has been played first on that round; but if somebody played a card of the Dominating element, the winner is the strongest of that element.&#10;&#10;The winner of each round then draws one card from the deck. Then the others also draw one card, in sequence. Play continues until all the cards have been played.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game the total number of Fame points is added up for each team. As there are 30 points for each Element, the maximum number of points is 120. The winner of the game is the team which scores 61 or more points. The score over 60 is kept to see which team wins the partita (the set) scoring a fixed amount of points.&#10;&#10;The cards have to be cut from a booklet that belongs to &quot;I giochi del duemila&quot; (&quot;The games of 2000&quot;) collection: a series of role-playing games, game books, wargames, card games and so on that included 23 titles. The name of the collection refers both to the end of the millennium and to the price: 2000 liras, that means 1.03 Euros, making them the cheapest games in Italy.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Briscola (1800)&#10;&#10;&#10;"

After all of your marbles have been launched, you tally up your score to compare with others.

The game also provides brief tools to design many scenarios of your own.  In fact you could say that it is this that the game does most best.

8402,,"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Great Pacific War is Avalanche Press' strategic-level game of the War in the Pacific. The game covers the entire war from December 1941 through 1946 and includes the forces of all participants. Players are placed in the positions of the commanders of the Japanese, British, Soviet and American forces in World War Two.&#10;&#10;The system is the same one used in Avalanche Press' game, Third Reich. In addition to five scenarios covering all or part of the War in the Pacific, Great Pacific War includes rules to link it and Third Reich to play the Second World War, a simulation of the entire conflict with up to seven players. Included in the game are five scenarios for the Great Pacific War and three scenarios for the linked Second World War. One of the Great Pacific War scenarios covers a possible 1931 conflict between Japan and America as postulated by the British journalist Hector Bywater in his book of the same title.&#10;&#10;The facts:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game scale is 60 miles per hex covering the battlefield on three 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps. Units are represented at corps, fleet and air army level. Each turn represents three months of actual time.&#10;     The game system is built around players drawing impulse &quot;chits&quot; to determine how they can activate their forces. The emphasis is on the interaction of military, political and economic factors (as in Third Reich).&#10;&#10;&#10;The game system from our Third Reich game allows players to control the military, political and economic destinies of their nations in a struggle to dominate the world. Land, air and sea forces battle across almost a third of the earth's surface as the two mightiest navies fight for control of the Pacific. Players manage their economies and build and operate their military forces within the capabilities of their nations' abilities.&#10;&#10;In Great Pacific War the Japanese player must decide initially whether war with America or the Soviet Union will be his or her strategy. Japan&Iacute;s lack of resources make a war with one or the other a necessity. Also possible is a war with Britain and her ally, The Netherlands, who together control the riches of India, Java and Borneo. This strategy has many risks, the greatest being that America will enter the war on Britain's side. Coloring all is the massive Japanese investment in China and the importance of those conquered territories to the Japanese economy. The American player must move a nation unprepared for war to a position of strength, while attempting to support the Nationalist Chinese in their conflict with the Japanese.&#10;&#10;In the linked game players have also to consider the effects of their actions on the global conflict. A Soviet player desperately defending Moscow in 1941 can little afford a Japanese attack on Vladivostok. Likewise a British player fighting Germany with only a seemingly soon-to-be-defeated Soviet Union as an ally, will not welcome a Japanese attack on his eastern possessions unless it brings America into the war. Historically Japan went to war to obtain the resources denied her by the Allies embargo of steel and oil and because German successes appeared to offer Japan the opportunity to join a victory almost already won. The question is whether you and your allies can do any better than your historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;3 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; maps&#10;2 countersheets consisting of 560 counters&#10;1 rulebook...separated into 2 booklets&#10;2 scenario booklets&#10;1 &quot;Policial Maker Explanations&quot; booklet&#10;1 Off-Map Movement and Sea Zones Chart 11&quot; x 17&quot;&#10;1 Chart with US Entry/Russian Winter Table/Mud Table&#10;1 Chart with Sequence of Play/Alliance &amp; Individual Victory Tables/Construction and Repair Costs&#10;1 Terrain Effects Chart&#10;1 Turn Impulse Track&#10;1 Production Costs&#10;9 Force Pool Charts(Netherlands,Britain,Soviet Union,Nationalist China,Communist China,United States(x2),Japan(x2))&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: &#10;The maps are not mounted like those in JP&#039;s Third Reich were.  This solves the problem of the maps not adjoining properly (as in Third Reich), but will upset those that like hard mounted maps. &#10; The game marries up with JP&#039;s Third Reich, but don't expect the maps to do so.  When played together, action will be on separate maps to create a monster game of the entire Second World War.&#10;&#10;"

Dunnigan turned his eye to the Western Front. Combat Command was described as &quot;Platoon-Company Level Combat, France 1944&quot;.&#10;&#10;From the Design Notes:&#10;&#10;&quot;PanzerBlitz (published by Avalon Hill) proved to be a very popular game.  It was complex, but most people were enthusiastic about its apparent realism and authenticity.  In point of fact, PanzerBlitz was not all that realistic or authentic.  The game did have its good points.  That it moved at all was a credit to its play-mechanics.  What was lacking was an awareness, and implementation, of some of the more critical aspects of small unit operations.  Chief among these aspects is the &quot;confusion factor&quot;, which becomes nearly decisive at the platoon level.  Other aspects left untreated in PanzerBlitz were the near simultaneity of action and reaction at that scale, as well as a more realistic handling of combined arms coordination.&#10;&#10;Not all of these problems (nor others unmentioned) have been solved in Combat Command.  By merely changing the cale and some of the combat and movement mechanics, we have introduced more change in the game than these innovations themselves suggest.  One rather obvious result is that the game is simpler, easier to play.  This is essential for any game.  Too much time spent on the mechanics makes the simulation more of an exercise than a game.  The game-system for platoon level simulation as it now stands in Combat Command is not yet perfect.  But we do feel it's superior to the system we first introduced in Tactical Game 3 and PanzerBlitz.  We are working on still better game-systems for this scale of operations.  When we finish them, we'll publish them!&quot;&#10;&#10;The Combat Command game system was quickly discarded as the seventies saw SPI release a string of &quot;new and improved&quot; tactical wargame systems.&#10;&#10;"

The Confederate garrison actually outnumbered the Union troops 18,000 to 15,000, but Grant's judgement of his opponent's psychology served him well. The unconditional surrender of the fort on Febuary 16th, 1862, shattered the Confederate defenses in western and middle Tennessee.The equivalent of an entire corps was taken prisoner, and the Cumberland River was opened to the Union Navy. Within weeks Nashville would fall and the remaining Confederate forces would retreat into Mississippi. The victory made a national hero of it's previously unknown author, who here began his rise to command of all the Union armies - U.S. Grant. Yet the battle could have turned out much differently, and the controversy in later years over what really happened and why, would be among the most intense surrounding any action of the war.&#10;&#10;"
