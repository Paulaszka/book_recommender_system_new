Cards represent your train cars and provide a visual reminder of your empire's growth as they extend out from your player board. On top of that, every game of First Class uses two of five interchangeable decks of action cards. Each deck provides new challenges for building your rail empire. One game might have you catering to the celebrities on your trains and fulfilling contracts along your route, while another game asks you to accommodate passengers and their luggage while you get swept up in a murder mystery. Each combination of modules opens many possible strategies and provides even more thematic flair. Return to a time when rail was king and grow your empire!&#10;&#10;"

Offensive players will block, read defenses, read holes, get open, pass, catch and run, all in an attempt to make a positive play for the offense. Defensive players will play the run, tackle, hit, rush the passer, sack the passer, defend pass routes, intercept the ball and force fumbles all in an attempt to make a positive play for the defense.  The task(s) on each play and the player(s) involved are determined by a GAME CENTER Chart which serves as the centerpiece for game play. A double-sided Play Result Card deck is used in conjunction with the GAME CENTER to determine who is involved on the play and what the result of the play is.  Nearly all plays from scrimmage come from the Play Result Deck, GAME CENTER Chart and individual player cards.  Long Gains, Special Teams, Trick Plays, Turnovers and Injuries get their results from a series of supplemental charts.  On any given play, an offensive player, defensive player or a combination of the two can influence the result.

The first drive on St. Louis had been repulsed and Van Dorn was summoned to take command of the force and launch a new offensive into the heart of Missouri. Van Dorn, an Indian-fighting cavalryman by trade, arrived at the Rebel camp and even though he was quite ill (due to a fall into a river) he immediately roused the troops. He proposed to launch an immediate attack, despite the freezing weather and fatigued state of his troops. Van Dorn force-marched the army north and managed to pull off a classic Napoleonic stratagem - the &ldquo;maneuver sur la derrieres&rdquo;. He placed his army astride the line of communications of his enemy and by any normal military measure this should have been settled the issue for the two armies. But by doing so at such an ill-advised time and at such an inhuman pace the Rebel troops were little more than a frozen and exhausted armed mob when they finally reached their positions. &#10; Brig. General Sam Curtis was not a man to be intimidated and he realized that he had a fighting chance, even in this seemingly impossible position. Perseverance and hard, smart fighting by men like Colonel Grenville Dodge and others turned what looked to be a potential disaster into a grand victory. The Battle of Pea Ridge secured for the Union all of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas, resulting in approximately 85,000 square miles becoming Federal-controlled territory.&#10;&#10;This is the second game in the Revolution Games/GMT series of American Civil War games. The first game, Stonewall&rsquo;s Sword simulates the Battle of Cedar Mountain in 1862.&#10;&#10;"

You will need that power to fight The Nightmare Invader - an evil entity who is trying to take control of all the guests by giving them terrifying nightmares.&#10;&#10;To win the game, first you must wake up as many guests as you can before the invader drives them insane with terror.  Then you will take the fight to the invader, trying to drive it out of the mind of its human host, or destroying it completely.  But it will not be easy.  The invader is completely alien, and uses deckbuilding to achieve its goals.  Meanwhile you must use six sided dice to achieve yours.&#10;&#10;The Invader gets the first turn.  On the Invader turn you draw 3 cards from the Invader deck, each showing a different fear, such as Ghosts or Spiders.  Any guests afraid of these fears become panicked.  If the Invader can panic a guest 5 times before you wake them, they succumb to the will of the Invader and their card is added to the Invader deck, making it stronger.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll 6 dice.  Each die can be used once.  If a die roll is high enough, you can use it to calm down a guest and if you calm the guest completely, they wake up and are removed from play.  Dice can also be used to learn extra skills and abilities, such as removing the Invader's health, or adding distractions to the Invader deck.&#10;&#10;It's a battle of dice versus cards.  Do you have what it takes to save humanity and defeat The Nightmare Invader?&#10;&#10;"

Ages 10 and up, for 2-8 players.&#10;ELECTION! The Presidential Campaign Game&#10;2nd Edition&#10;Overview:&#10;Citizens vote to elect our president. In this game, you can lead the campaign! ELECTION! is a game of trivia, teamwork, &amp; campaign strategy. Players compete to be the first party to claim the most electoral votes in an American Presidential election campaign. Players lead their party&rsquo;s campaign for president by raising funds and purchasing Town Hall, Advertise, and Charisma cards to earn votes. Then with votes in hand, they strategically claim State's electoral votes and ensure their party's victory. Game Play:&#10;&#10;Each turn involves three actions.&#10;1 Roll dice&#10;2 Buy Cards&#10;3 Claim States&#10;ACTION 1: Players can choose to roll the dice to raise funds. ACTION 2: They can opt to buy cards to build their campaign and earn popular votes. For example, buy a Town Hall trivia card to test your knowledge of history, State Capitals, State nicknames, and more. A correct response earns the votes. ACTION 3: With popular votes in hand, the players use them to win selected States on the score ballot.&#10;&#10;Players may also &quot;endorse&quot; a teammate after their three actions. This is done by forwarding cards to a teammate's hand, pooling cards and votes to claim more States during their turn. Can the party now claim enough electoral votes to win the election?&#10;&#10;Game progress is kept on the score ballot. The score ballot lists all 50 states and DC, and is sorted based on presidential election results from 1988 through 2008. There are states that lean red, states that lean blue, and swing states in the middle. States that lean toward the player's political party require fewer popular votes to claim. The swing states are equal for each party, and are more difficult for both. By claiming states with earned votes, players win electoral votes for their party and work toward victory. The electoral votes listed are current for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections.&#10;&#10;"
