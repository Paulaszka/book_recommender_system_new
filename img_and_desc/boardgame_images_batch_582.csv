It is a dice based area control game.  Players take turn rolling the dice, allowing them to place/move their warriors onto the board.  Certain rolls provide special powers, but most involving adding warriors to one of the three regions.  After each turn, the player drops a CHI token into a column, where it randomly falls into one of the three regions.  When a player reaches 4 warriors in one region, they take all CHI from that region and remove all their warriors.  Other players who were present keep any warriors they had there.  When all 25 CHI tokens have been collected, the player with the most CHI tokens wins.&#10;&#10;Dropping tokens into the tower at first appears random.  However, with some practice, it is possible to partially control which region will get the dropped CHI.&#10;&#10;Like other LEGO games, the rulebook includes several variants and encourages players to develop their own rules.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;A tribal conflict game to collect precious CHI.&#10;Plan where to send your warriors to capture the most CHI.&#10;Will the next CHI fall in the territory you control?&#10;&#10;1 buildable LEGO Dice&#10;12 LEGO microfigures&#10;198 LEGO pieces&#10;Rule booklet&#10;Building instructions&#10;&#10;Set # 50006&#10;Item # 6024935&#10;&#10;"

The game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles, with the armies in this set particularly focused towards cavalry and ranged combat.&#10;&#10;During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn. Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.&#10;&#10;The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Elves and the Lizardmen. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Elf faction is based around strong cavalry units and archers, but has a relatively weak infantry. The Lizardmen army is the most flexible Lords of War army released so far and is best used to disrupt and counter enemy attack strategies.&#10;&#10;Elves versus Lizardmen is compatible with Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.&#10;&#10;"

You try to choose a tile that will give you points and/or gems. The gems let you buy genies, which have special powers like building twice in one turn, or moving a tile you previously placed.&#10;&#10;Players are limited by the edges of the starting board, including the bonus tiles (question marks). You have to have at least one tile beneath you to build, and you can't make a hole in the palace, so things are somewhat constrained. The tiles are two-sided and can be flipped if you need the mirror-image tile.&#10;&#10;Each player board has attributes that score points, like windows or plants. You also have 2 hidden objectives/bonuses, which might be points for making a column of windows. The game ends when someone builds their fifth sky tile.

You know that if you could prove yourself worthy of leading these troops, fame and wealth would follow. By assembling the most powerful army of mythological creatures equipped with rare artifacts, you will beat the other conjurers in town.&quot;&#10;&#10;During the twelve rounds of &quot;Conjurers&quot;, the conjuring players and their assistants struggle to gather sufficient resources to purchase powerful items and magical artifacts. Simultaneously, they need to build up their armies of mythological creatures in order to wage war against increasingly powerful beasts and rivaling conjurers alike. The conjurers will have to fight at the mythological battlegrounds of Olympus Mons, Valhalla, Shangri La, Garden of Eden, and Duat in order to force the defeated creatures to be summoned to future battles at the conjurers' demand. Time is of the essence, each turn is valuable, and faulty decisions can cost you dearly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Conjurers&quot; takes place in a mythological universe and is a game of priorities and strategy, which allows for a high degree of diversity from game to game. So buckle up, and prepare for an intense and challenging experience from start to finish.&#10;&#10;Game description:&#10;&#10;&quot;Conjurers&quot; is a strategy board game based on five different mythologies: The Biblical, the Egyptian, the Greek, the Japanese, and the Norse. The objective is to collect the highest number of points, which are all counted by the end of the game, after round 12. Points may be gathered through creatures, artifacts, and resources. A player may choose a strategy of striving for one or more of various point bonuses, such as an Abundance Bonus, which is unlocked by controlling a large number of creatures within the same mythology by the end of the game. It is therefore possible to disrupt the plans and strategies of the opponents throughout the game &ndash; if you succeed in figuring out their strategy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Conjurers&quot; is a worker placement game, which consists of 4 phases, each with 3 rounds. At the start of each phase new actions are unlocked. The primary actions are to:&#10;&#10;&bull;    gather resources&#10;&bull;    buy items and artifacts&#10;&bull;    hire assistants to get more actions&#10;&bull;    attempt to gain control of a mythological creature by defeating it in battle&#10;&bull;    collect feed for your creatures&#10;&bull;    sacrifice creatures to gain resources and optimize your army&#10;&bull;    duel the other conjurers&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one conjurer figure, one assistant figure, and three level 1 creatures in their armies. If a player allocates the conjurer figure or the warrior assistant to one of the mythological battlegrounds, he or she may choose any creature, level 2 &ndash; 5, from the given mythology and fight it. If the player defeats the creature, he or she collects it, and it becomes part of that player&rsquo;s army. A conjurer can only bring three creatures from the army into each battle. The fighting creatures are chosen at random after the player has declared which mythological creature he or she is attempting to defeat. Optimizing your army is therefore vital if you wish to try to collect the higher level creatures.&#10;&#10;Please note that &quot;Conjurers&quot; is a worker placement game; the battle sequences are rather brief, and it is the strategic decisions on point combinations and player interaction which is at the heart of the game. Good luck, and enjoy.&#10;&#10;"
