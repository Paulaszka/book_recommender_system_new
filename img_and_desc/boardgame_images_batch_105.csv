The other side plays Professor Van Helsing and his faithful friends who rise to put an end to the vampire lord&rsquo;s threat once again.&#10;Dracula&rsquo;s Revenge is the first in the &quot;Gothica&quot; series of games. Each entry in the series shares the same basic rules system. This allows you to put the components from the various games together to play whole new games that are larger and stranger than the originals.&#10;&#10;Description from the Box&#10;Eleven years after faking his death, Count Dracula returns to London with one thing on his mind: REVENGE! All that stands between him and his goal are Professor Van Helsing and his loyal band of friends. Choose sides and claim your stake.  This one's going to be bloody!&#10;&#10;Dracula's Revenge is the board game of the desperate war between hunters and vampires in Victorian England. Returning to London eleven years after his apparent death, Count Dracula thirsts for revenge, and he's created an army of undead to help him get it. Prepared this time for the vampire threat, Van Helsing and his stalward friends stand ready to put Dracula back into his grave for the ultimate time!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fast and deadly. Players move characters around a board depicting the catacombs snaking beneath London's teeming streets, battling against each other for their lives. On his side, Dracula has vampires of all stripes - she-wolves, nosferatu, and seductive vampiress - as well as the mindless minions they've enslaved. Against them, Van Helsing leads a force of heroes armed with stakes, crossbows, and a fearsome faith in God.&#10;&#10;In the battle between good and evil, it's time to choose sides.&#10;&#10;The game comes with:&#10;&#10;20 tiles (used to form the board, making for nearly unlimited replay value) &#10;36 characters (including rules for building forces of your own) &#10;36 action cards &#10;9 dice &#10;12 doors &#10;48 plastic counter stands &#10;12 vampire mist counters &#10;2 dice screens &#10;2 quick-reference cards &#10;32-page rulebook&#10;&#10;"

Cones can move one square in orthogonal or diagonal direction. Cones can also jump over smaller ones, or cover smaller (opponent&rsquo;s) ones.&#10;&#10;Initially, players set their pieces on their nearest row, and aim of the game is moving the two smaller visible pieces on the opposite side of the board. In other words, if your opponent covers your smallest piece with a bigger one of him, your goal is moving on the opposite side the second and third smaller pieces of yours (until your opponent uncovers your smallest piece)&hellip;&#10;&#10;"

Each card has a single digit (0-9) on it, and the starting player has three cards in hand. After looking at those cards, she presents a three-digit number to the other players; all the digits in this number must go from high to low, so 873 is okay but 783 is not. She then passes those cards to the next player, who can discard any number of cards from his hand, replace those cards with new ones from the deck, then present players with a larger three-digit number &ndash; a number that matches the cards he has in hand, of course. This continues until someone refuses to accept the cards being passed and calls out the previous player as a liar. Reveal the cards, and see who is correct. Whoever is wrong loses points equal to the number of symbols on the cards that were passed.&#10;&#10;"

The players are traders in this day, competing to be the first to earn 60 gold by buying and selling tea, hide, fruits, salt, silk, and trinkets.

Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards, and activate buildup cards.&#10;&#10;In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.&#10;&#10;By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game's attraction lies with the many special cards.

They explore, using a new movement mechanic, for the raw materials they need to build the settlement. Along the way, they discover useful natural products - but also encounter wild animals and are confronted with adventurous situations. Those who survive these encounters obtain the raw materials they sought as well as experience points that improve the abilities of the player's character. Over time, then, the player becomes stronger, smarter or more charismatic and is better and better suited for the dangers of the wild.&#10;&#10;Back in the village, the natural products can be used to brew beverages while the raw materials are used for building. Through this building, the settlement grows and players obtain victory points.&#10;&#10;The main attraction of the game lies in the exploration of the island and the development of the individual player characters.

How much is a &quot;day&quot;?  Well, you start on a mountaintop and begin walking.  If you come back to the mountain by sundown, you get all the land you encircle.&#10;&#10;The board is a 24x32 grid.

Each card indicates how far and in what direction you move (your &quot;boundary&quot; is indicated by plastic cones in your color) and how much time it took--around the board, a Sun token moves from Dawn to Dusk.  When the Sun token hits Dusk, the game is over.  If you end up back on your mountain, you get points equal to the area you have enclosed (plus how many spaces are in your boundary--for the Go-enabled, it's &quot;Chinese scoring&quot;).

Gameplay is the usual roll-the-die-and-take-a-card fare.  Playing pieces are photographs of the toys mounted on cardboard with plastic bases.  The board is a fairly impressive 3-D cardboard creation that takes a few minutes to set up.  When assembled, the board is four levels high.  Bottom level is the main board and players start in the middle of each side on their home spaces.  There are two stairways with bridges to the second level--a ring of spaces that sits above the center of the board.  The third level is a smaller ring set above this one.  Fourth level is a single space that sits above this.  Baron Karza, the bad guy, starts on level four.  If the characters land on certain spaces, they check the &quot;Intruder Control&quot;--a cardboard dial with its face hidden by a movable window.  They turn the dial however they wish, then open the window to see if Karza stays where he is, or teleports to one of four numbered spaces on the board.  Players must land on Karza's space by exact count to capture him.  Players may also land on their opponents' spaces, forcing said opponents to return to their starting space.&#10;&#10;"

Each turn the player draws a card from the draw pile or from the top of the discard pile.

12040,,"Omega Chess is a variant of Chess, played on an expanded board with two new types of pieces.&#10;It mostly follows the rules of traditional chess.&#10;&#10;The whole chessboard has 10x10+4 squares: it consists of one large expanded 10x10 square with ten rows and ten columns of squares, as well as four additional squares which are located diagonally to each corner.&#10;&#10;Those outmost corners are the opening position for the Wizards, one new kind of piece in Omega Chess. The other new kind of piece are the Champions, which are located in the corners of the 10x10 square, with a Pawn in front of them (there are ten in total) and a Tower to their side. The remaining pieces - that are also found on a traditional 8x8 square - are between the Champions and their Pawn, arranged as usual.&#10;&#10;Similarly to the Knight, the new pieces are classified as leapers, which allows them to jump over pieces. A Champion can jump two squares in all eight directions. The Wizard can either jump three squares straight and then one square to either side, or move one square diagonally. Except for Pawns, standard pieces move as usual. Pawns are also allowed to move three squares from their initial position. As with moving two squares at once, they can be captured en passant when doing so.&#10;&#10;"

12049,,"Wintergewitter: The Doomed Attempt to Relieve Stalingrad, is the first in the Campaign Study Series.  It depicts the attack by the German 57th Panzerekorps to open a corridor to the 6th Army, trapped in the Stalingrad Kessel. The fierce battle, that took place between December 12-23, 1942, was not a foregone conclusion. The fate of 20 German divisions hung in the balance&mdash;and the loss of 6th Army would turn the tide in the Eastern Front.&#10;&#10;The German player must use his initial advantage to open a corridor to 6th Army. The Soviet player will react quickly, but must first withstand a powerful enemy attack before he can bring powerful reinforcements to bear.&#10;&#10;The game scale is two miles per hex. Each turn represents 12 hours. Units vary in size from Companies to Army (headquarters only). Designer Mark Stille performed intensive research during the design. The German OOB is drawn from the actual War Diary of the 4th Panzerarmee and from the incomparable &quot;Stalingrad&quot; by Manfred Kehrig, a detailed German-language book on the subject. The USSR OOB is drawn from a superb 1943 Soviet General Staff study, and the Kehrig work.&#10;&#10;Soviet units vary from half-strength Rifle Divisions of 51st Army to the powerful formations of 2nd Guards Army.

12059,,"Ottomans is a historical simulation of the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries. That era saw the Ottomans go from a small nation competing for survival in the Near East to a regional superpower, forming a state that lasted until the end of the First World War. To build their empire, the Ottomans conquered the remnant of the Byzantine Empire, won smashing victories over other Islamic states and twice pushed to the gates of Vienna.&#10;&#10;There are four factions in the game, each represented by a color: the Turks (Ottomans and others), the Holy League (mainly Catholic Europeans), the Orthodox (eastern Christians), and the Caliphate (a general term for the more established Islamic states). Within each faction there are individual nations. For example, the Turks include the Ottomans and the Seljuks.   Each player controls a &ldquo;core nationality&rdquo;; that is, one nationality within a faction of which he may never lose control. In the course of the game players may gain control of additional nationalities, some of which may be inimical to each other.&#10;&#10;Ottomans is played in a series of turns. Within each game turn, players pick stratagem markers (which allow players to take certain political and military actions), move their forces and engage in combat. A player, while representing an individual faction, may control forces from other factions. Players will find themselves sometimes attacking forces they control, while perhaps temporarily aligning themselves with an opponent, in order to reach their final goals. Throughout each game turn, players may use stratagem markers to gain military and political advantages as well as to undermine their foes. Players receive reinforcements depending on which regions they control.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to build the strongest empire. At the end of the game, players check to see which faction won the game. The player who contributed the most to that faction&rsquo;s victory wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Rogers' Rangers, Indians, line troops, marines, militia, coureurs de bois - the rules differentiate between them all.   Rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, morale, wounds, disorganization, etc., are given.&#10;&#10;Due to the extensive wilderness this war was fought in, there are rules for &quot;fog of war.&quot;  Each unit uses a &quot;tray&quot; - a simple board to hold the miniatures on.  But you don't put the miniatures on the trays until contact is made.  Instead, depending on the terrain, you actually use more trays than you have units!  Certain amounts of dummy trays are allotted in each scenario, and you have to scout them out to see which are real and which are not.  Even then you may not be able to tell what type of troops are on the trays until they fire at you...&#10;&#10;Another interesting rule is the &quot;officer incident&quot; rule.  At the end of each move when in fire combat, you must roll on the officer incident table.  This is a table of 66 events - use 2d6, reading them as percentile dice.  Results range from beneficial to deleterious, from mild to instant death.  Many are humorous, such as #44: &quot;A musket ball misses the officer's head, hits the flag staff, breaking it, the finial landing on the officer's crown, knocking him out.  Light wound, unconscious for 1d6 moves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Two scenarios are provided and advice given for creating more.

Rules are given for movement, morale, ranged fire, melee combat, Indians, Rangers, European Line troops, local militia, ambush, etc.&#10;&#10;Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one &quot;3&quot; card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite.&#10;&#10;Scenarios include both Battle Scale and Skirmish Scale settings.  Braddock's Defeat, Battle for Lake George, a raid by Rogers' Rangers, Scaling the Heights of Abraham at Quebec City, and many more, are all represented.&#10;&#10;The campaign game can be played as a separate wargame, or used to generate Battle Scale miniatures games, as you wish.

Figures are defined as either Leading Players, Supporting Actors, Bit Parts or Extras.  A Leading Player can mow through a lot of Extras without even slowing down, but combat between two characters of the same level is tense and more drawn out.&#10;&#10;Rules are also given for two types of stunts: Deeds of Derring-Do and Dramatic Entrances.

One scenario is for pirates and the other for musketeers.&#10;&#10;The rules not only deal with figures, but also add stand-alone rules for ship-to-ship combat and boarding.  The ship movement system is very simple and completely ignores the wind (except you can't sail directly into it), even though these are sailing ships.&#10;&#10;This is a light, easy, not too detailed set of miniatures rules aimed at fun rather than historical accuracy.
