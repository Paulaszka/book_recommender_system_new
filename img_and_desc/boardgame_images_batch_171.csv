The reverse side of a stick is called, caya, &quot;nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;Before starting the players agree upon the number of points to win, the higher the number, the more challenging and the more fun. Typically, 5, 7 or 11 point totals are selected. Usually starting with the youngest player and proceeding to that person's right, each person throws the four game sticks onto the rug before them. Depending on how the sticks land, the following points are possible.&#10;&#10;* one &quot;couple,&quot; a &aacute;ayet and a hamma of the same color = one point&#10;&#10;* two &quot;couples,&quot; both sets of &aacute;ayet and a hamma sticks = three points&#10;&#10;* one &aacute;ayet and two hamma = two points. This combination refers to the Nim&iacute;ipuu practice of looking after a male friend's wife should he fall in combat.&#10;&#10;* if there are no pairs matched, e.g., &aacute;ayet and a hamma of differing colors = no points&#10;&#10;* but if all the sticks land caya, &quot;nothing&quot; = all points accumulated are lost and the player starts over.&#10;&#10;After deciding on the win point total, be it 5, 7, or 11, the players need to agree on other rules. Will you need to win on the exact number, be it 5, 7 or 11, not going over that total? If a player gains points beyond the agreed upon win point total, will extra points over that total be subtracted from that player's earned points?

If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.&#10;&#10;Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series.
