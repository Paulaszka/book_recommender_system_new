On your turn, you play new cards from your hand to open factories and upgrade existing ones, select improvements, improve factory quality, build machines, and employ new workers. You can also pay money to improve your shareholdings, and take out loans if you require more money for production costs. After the actions phase, you can improve your abilities by advancing your development markers on your player board, or take one of the available development cards.&#10;&#10;Then, the production phase starts, where every player who owns a factory of the current good produces those goods. The market fluctuates with the general demand, so the demand may be lower than the value of your current good, lowering your profit. Workers must be paid, and machines need regular maintenance, so you can possibly lose money instead of turning a profit. Selling enough of one good improves your share value, and there are bonuses for having the highest appeal. Lastly, if you can&rsquo;t sell your goods to the home market, you can ship them overseas or store them for future rounds.&#10;&#10;After the final round of the last decade, the game ends. Players then sell all goods left in their storehouses, reduce the number of shares they hold by the number of loans they took, and reduce their share value based on their personal shipping track. Each player then multiplies the number of their shares by their share value to determine their end score. The player with the highest end score wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Choose natural treasures, historical treasures and/or locations around the Island, then collect the most cards in similar groups by asking for cards from other players or by picking up discarded cards.&#10;&#10;The Nature Hike has you searching for the route that will allow you to spot the most natural treasures each turn. Pick a card, roll the die to determine how many habitats you can visit, or if you have encountered an obstacle and must discard cards. A variation adds more player interaction by inviting you to collect observations from other players.&#10;&#10;The Scavenger Hunt is a cooperative game where players work together to find a pre-determined set of treasures before Winter arrives. Each turn, roll the die to move toward a revealed Scavenger Hunt destination while observing natural treasures along the way. When you get to the destination, if you can match the hiding place card of the historical treasure there, you collect the treasure. If you can't match it, another player can pick up the treasure later, or give you the card you need to collect it. You exchange natural treasure observations for more hiding place cards. You may also encounter events along the way, either obstacles, opportunities, or a change of season.&#10;&#10;The Hide and Seek game tests your memory as each turn reveals the hiding place of historical treasures on the Island that you can collect...if you remember where they are. Each turn, you can add a card to your hand, play a new movement option (that lets you move around the Island faster or slower, depending on the season), play event cards on other players (to slow them down), move to new locations while observing natural treasures (which add points to your score), and hunt for historical treasures (by flipping over a hidden location card around the board - if you are at the location on the card, you keep the treasure and score). Whoever finds the most treasures usually wins.&#10;&#10;The Treasure Hunt has you playing the sleuth, asking questions of the other players in order to discover the treasures they have hidden around the Island. Using the same movement and event rules as The Hide and Seek game, this game gives players many opportunities to score points: Visit locations on cards in your hand to score and gain special abilities useful in the hunt. Play historical treasures from your hand to score and help everyone know which treasures are not hidden. Ask yes or no questions of the other players to determine the location and the treasure they have hidden on the Island. Guess the treasure and location correctly to score big, or lose a little if you're wrong.&#10;&#10;Choose the experience you want based on the available players (2 to 8 people can play), the amount of time you have, or how much you want to think. While some of the games share common rules and themes (for example, each game features some sort of nature observation), each is a separate game. Cards have information about the Island you can read as you play, though knowledge about the Island is not required to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

He was an extraordinary monarch: being engaged in the publication of laws and economy, poetry and writing, he was also obsessed with stars.&#10;At the very beginning of his reign, Alfonso X invited the best astronomers and asked them to compile detailed astronomical tables with coordinates of celestial objects. The Alfonsine tables laid the foundation for scientific works of Copernicus and revolution in astronomy.&#10;In 1283 under his leadership the translation of the Arabic composition &ldquo;Libro de los Juegos&rdquo; (&ldquo;Book of games&rdquo;) was completed into Spanish and this brought chess and many other board games from East to Europe.

By placing a figure on one of colored sectors at your board, you determine the color for figure that the next player will take. However, he is also free to place this figure anywhere on his board.  &#10;Each figure combines several bright stars on the board and has 1 or 2 external connections, allowing you to continue the constellation. When you finish the constellation (it has no longer open external connections), you get victory points by the number of bright stars in it.&#10;&#10;When one of figures&rsquo; pile ends, all players lay out a new pack and complete the round.
