Averett&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;No country ever lost a war by being too strong&quot; &#10;Field-Marshall Viscount Montgomery of Alamein&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CONQUEST OF THE WORLD represents a significant departure from traditional game design. The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers. &#10;Electronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units.The game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's.&#10;&#10;Forty-three countries have been divided into eleven &quot;politectonic&quot; or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force.&#10;&#10;These figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A.&#10;&#10;Pp = (C+E+M)x(S+W)&#10;&#10;PERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will).&#10;&#10;Future shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on.&#10;&#10;If you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games.&#10;&#10;Conquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others.&#10;&#10;&#10;THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Not for dinner, mind you, but to sell to markets for a grand haul. In order to make the most for your efforts, you want to concentrate on those crabs grouped together in large sets. Otherwise you're piddling away time spent chasing individual crabs, which is hardly worth the bother. The fishermen who nets the most valuable haul wins the game.&#10;&#10;Set-up in Kraby differs depending on the number of players, with 80 or 120 tiles in play, the game board being 9x9 or 11x11, and the number of colored crab figures being 10, 12 or 15. Each player starts by secretly drawing six crab tiles (which come in four colors with two players and five colors otherwise) and placing them behind their screen. On a turn, a player chooses one tile and enters it from any side of the game board, sliding it in the row or column until it hits the island at the center of the board or another tile in play. (A move that would slide a tile off the board or create an impossible-to-fill space is illegal.) The player then draws a new tile and places it behind his screen.&#10;&#10;A player then has the option of placing one of the colored crab figures in his ship's hold. Each ship has three holds, with a scoring multiplier of x1, x2 or x3. A player can claim a color only once and cannot place it on the same multipler as another player. In a four-player game, a player can claim only two figures.)&#10;&#10;The game ends once the final tile has been placed and the game board filled. Each group of crabs in the same color, with orthogonally adjacent crabs belonging to the same group, is worth -1 to 5 points depending on its size. Once the value of a color is determined, each player scoring this color multiplies this value &ndash; which might be negative &ndash; by the multipliers showing on his ship's hold.

Some cards have a parachute symbol and other don't. the more parachute you get, the more you multiply the value of the points you take in the last turn.&#10;&#10;In your turn you can draw a card or play a card (not both) and you can have a maximum of 3 cards in your hand.&#10;&#10;If two parachutists are on the same zone, they entangle each other and they start &quot;fighting&quot;, they both throw the dice and the winner pushes the other in another free landing zone, but the looser won't take any points at the end of the round. in case of draw, the one that has been moved, return wherever it was.&#10;&#10;Fast, easy, funny with high interactivity with other players and lots of laughs with the illustrations of Angelo Porazzi.&#10;&#10;check it out at&#10;http://www.worldoftwilights.com&#10;&#10;Woosh and Giorgio Vezzini will be present at Essen Fair 2009 Angelo Porazzi Games booth 30 Hall 9.&#10;&#10;"
