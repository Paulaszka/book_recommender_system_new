Each player takes on the role of a hero and must work together to overcome the Darkness. Using a deck of cards unique to each hero, players explore the realm, battle evil monsters, manage critical tasks, and avoid dangerous traps in order to complete quests and acquire powerful new items and abilities.&#10;&#10;Players' avatars are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.&#10;&#10;Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.&#10;&#10;Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.&#10;&#10;Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players compete to gain Power over the course of the game by voting on legislation their supporters approve or oppose; at the end of the game, the player with the most Power is the winner.&#10;&#10;Demockrasy is played over four rounds. Each round has a Drafting phase, when you choose Politicians and Supporters, and a Legislation phase, when you sponsor and vote on Legislation.&#10;&#10;During the Drafting phase, players pass several hands of cards around the table, each hand containing Politicians and Supporters. Players pick one of the cards from their hand, play it face-up in front of them, and pass the hand to the next player (passing left or right, depending on which round it is). There are three types of cards: Politicians, which may carry one to five supporters; Supporters, which give their associated politician one, two, or three votes; and Wild cards, which give the player a one-time opportunity to affect a legislative outcome or attack an opposing politician.  Once all players have played five cards, the Legislation phase begins.&#10;&#10;During the Legislation phase, each player must sponsor one Bill from their hand of Legislation cards (each player receives four Legislation cards at the beginning of the game).  The player with the top-ranked politician sponsors the first Bill. Once the Bill has been revealed, all players must cast a vote to OPPOSE or APPROVE the bill on behalf of all of their supporters and politicians.  Each player votes the total number of votes provided by their supporters. A simple majority wins; in a tie, the Bill fails.&#10;&#10;Supporters may (a) APPROVE a Bill, (b) OPPOSE a Bill, or (c) neither. If a Politician betrays a Supporter--for example, by voting to APPROVE a Bill that's opposed by his or her supporters--then that Supporter will abandon its Politician and break one of that Politician's hearts.  Each politician has 1 to 5 hearts; when the last heart breaks, the Politician retires and the associated supporters are discarded. Players also receive a broken heart--which they can assign to a politician of their choice--when they are on the losing side of a vote.&#10;&#10;There are three ways to gain power: (1) if you sponsor a bill that passes, you get 1 Power; (2) if you APPROVE a bill that passes, you get 1 Power; (3) you get 1 Power for each Legislation result that aligns to your Supporters' interests.&#10;&#10;After each round, clean up the spent Legislation cards and deal new Demockrasy cards (Politicians, Supporters, and Wild cards) to build up your political staff again!

Pieces are not obligated to be contiguous with previous plays, but if a player ends the game with multiple networks, one will be removed.&#10;&#10;After track has been placed, the players look to see if any stations expand.  Each station is worth a number of points equal to how many different lines have connected to it, and once a new line connects, additional wooden station tokens are stacked on top of previous ones.&#10;&#10;Each players' score is equal to the value of the stations in their network.&#10;&#10;"

Cards collected in two suits are worth positive points, and the other two suits are negative points.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a small hand, then the top card of the deck is flipped face up. The players compete in a must-follow trick-taking game, with the winner of each trick taking the face-up card from the deck in their hand, and the other player doing the same with a face-down card from the top of the deck. After the round, the players' points are converted to a type of meta points by moving a pawn on a red carpet.&#10;&#10;In subsequent rounds, the player who is behind in meta points begins the round by setting cards aside from their hand to create a small private deck; they will draw from this deck once the main draw pile is exhausted.&#10;&#10;"
