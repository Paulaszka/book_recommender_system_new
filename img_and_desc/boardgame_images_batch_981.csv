Each player controls an avatar moving around an ever-shrinking grid of tiles representing a nodes on company&rsquo;s network, such as email servers or security cameras. When you move onto a tile, you hack the node to extract a token of information secretly worth 1, 2 or 3 points. Once all of the company&rsquo;s secrets have been looted, you steal from each other instead.&#10;&#10;With each move, tiles are tagged for suspicious activity and eventually shutdown, leaving gaps in the network and limiting your movement.

Your spoils are only secure after you logout of the system, either by running out of possible moves or waiting until the network gets small enough to slip out. Once everyone has logged out, the winner is the player with the most valuable set of tokens.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Of course, if either fails too often, they both lose overall, so .... :-) )&#10;&#10;The player chooses either the H (High Himalayas) route with its hazards or the M (Japanese fighter-interceptor aerodrome at Myitkina) route.  He takes the maximum number of transport aircraft pieces possible and then adds to that upside-down piece mix a number of hazard pieces equal to half the number of transports rounded up.&#10;&#10;(In 1942-43, trying to fly the lower route over Myitkina is very much pushing your luck, depending on Japanese fighter strength and who wins the air battle.)&#10;&#10;From that inverted total he pulls a number of pieces equal to the number of original transports and finds out if sufficient loads - DC3s/C-47s carry 1, C-46s and (B-24 Liberator transport) C-87s carry 2 (although the C-87s can only carry 1 over the High route), and the late war DC-4s/C-54s carry *4*! - make it over the Hump.&#10;&#10;Of course, the number of loads required each season increases with the Allied supreme commanders' demands.&#10;&#10;The USAAF Air Transport Command actually delivered far more supplies in the air than could be delivered by gas-guzzling trucks on the Burma and then Ledo/Stilwell Roads.&#10;&#10;Hazards include Engine Failure, Unexpected Mountain, Mule Stampede!

Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains and expand your railroad empire. Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;In more detail, players use washable crayons to draw their train routes over a map of the North Pole, including North America, Greenland, Asia, and Europe. Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns. For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train. The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff. Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase. During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards. When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one. Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards. When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed. During the building phase, a player may pay to build more track or upgrade their train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect their track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;"
