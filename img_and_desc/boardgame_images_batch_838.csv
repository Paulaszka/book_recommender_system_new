In turn, each player/team rolls two six-sided dice, leave start, and advance around the outer track in either direction.  A player/team may roll a die and advance again when answering a question about religion correctly. There are two sets of question cards. One set for beginners; another set for advanced players. Each card contains six questions. The asker simply asks the next question on the card. The correct response is on the back of the card. There is no penalty for a wrong answer. However, if while taking one&rsquo;s turn that player says, &ldquo;Yeah, but&rdquo; then the player&rsquo;s pawn is sent back to the starting space.&#10;&#10;Players must follow the instructions on any space on which one&rsquo;s pawn rests. A player may not advance a second pawn until the first pawn has reached Home of Humility (finish). The third pawn may not be moved until the second pawn has reached the finish space.  A pawn does not have to reach the finish space by exact count. Any unused movement points are given to the next pawn. The first player/team to get all three of one's pawns to the finish is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Here are the major changes:&#10;The board game focuses on the limited-tile play of the Sakura-flavored Entanglement maps, not the boundary-based maps of classic Entanglement. This change makes initial setup much easier and prevents pre-placed tiles from shifting off-grid when they're not adjacent to other tiles.&#10;Sakura tiles are dealt into players' hands instead of being pre-placed on the board. (This is for the same reason given in #1, and also adds a little more strategy and variety.)&#10;Scoring is based on the total length of completed lines instead of on the length of individual moves. This change helps the game move a bit faster, since tallying scores like the web game isn't terribly fun to do manually.&#10;The lines are thicker, and they don't glow. The thin lines were confusing to follow visually, and I didn't want the game to be radioactive.&#10;&#10;Components: Box; 72 Hex Tiles; Rules Document; 6 (different colored) Pawns&#10;&#10;"

Stardrill has acquired the mining rights to Saturn&rsquo;s largest moon &ndash; Titan - and is sending in a team to strip it of its resources.&#10;&#10;Your task is to fill the hold of your ship with as many units of valuable resources from Titan as possible, in order to earn the most Credits by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To help its teams with their task, Stardrill has supplied a number of Extraction Plants - buildings which can be placed anywhere on the map. These extraction plants will allow you to obtain different types of resources. As you&rsquo;re all employees of Stardrill, once placed these buildings can be accessed and used by any player!&#10;&#10;Place pipes branching out from your main base to create the extraction network that will bring resources into the hold of your cargo ship. Each time you integrate an extraction plant into your network by joining a section of pipe to it, it activates, gaining you a unit of the resource of the building&rsquo;s type.&#10;&#10;Once obtained, these resources will have to be managed carefully, as you only have a limited amount of space in your hold! When full, no more resources can be added without spending or jettisoning others first. &#10;Some resources have value during the game and can be spent to free up space in your hold, while others can only score points at the end of the game - so you&rsquo;ll need to keep an eye on the space you have, and time your activations carefully.&#10;&#10;There are 6 resources available on Titan: Deuterium, Hydrocarbons, Silicium, Titanium, Water, and Tholin.&#10;&#10;However, not all of these resources are desirable.

Being a manufacturing powerhouse only 120 miles from Washington DC and the Confederate capital, it became the focus of Union attention. The threat of capture by Federal forces was constant.&#10;&#10;The Late Unpleasantness covers the two major attempts to capture the Confederate Capital City. Gates of Richmond covers the Seven Days Battles with Robert E Lee facing down George McClellan. If It Takes All Summer is Ulysses S Grant&rsquo;s overland campaign of 1864, which added the names of Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse and Cold Harbor to Civil War history.&#10;&#10;Each game stands alone, but share the majority of rules. Simple enough to learn and play in an evening, but enough twists and turns to make you want to replay it until it is worn.&#10;&#10;The maps use a point to point movement system, rather than hexes to simulate the campaigning over the road networks and river crossings, rather than mass movements cross country. Combat is integrated into the movement, making coordination of large bodies of troops difficult.&#10;&#10;The Gates of Richmond map covers the area from Richmond in the west to the White House on the Pamunkey, and from Mechanicsville south to Harrison&rsquo;s Landing. Key features such as Malvern Hill, Beaver Dam Creek, and the bridges over White Oak swamp and the Chickahominy are highlighted. Will the Union army fail to attack the Richmond works as a result of &ldquo;Prince John&rdquo; Magruder&rsquo;s antics?&#10;&#10;If It Takes All Summer covers most of Central Virginia, from Brandy Station and Culpeper to the Cold Harbor north east of Richmond. The Wilderness features prominently in the campaign with a special table to create some of the confusion as a result of fighting in this tangle.&#10;&#10;The basic units are divisions (a bit larger than usual for Civil War, but right in this case). Each unit is listed for strength and overall leadership/morale quality.  Stacks are hidden for limited intelligence. Corps and Army leaders are available to modify the die roll in an attack as well as to help coordinate attacks from more than a single stack.&#10;&#10;Sequence of play is straight forward with supply first.  Units out of supply suffer movement and combat penalties and those with a continued lack of supply will suffer attrition.  Confederate supply is a simple trace to either Richmond or a railroad, while the Union needs to relocate his base to keep his offensive moving.&#10;&#10;Units move, then attack as a part of the stack&rsquo;s movement. Terrain, strength and leadership are all die roll modifiers, in combat. Combat losses are in terms of strength points, but a third die is rolled to determine if the combat ends in a retreat or continues. If it continues, you count it up and do it again. (and possibly again) If your leaders are good enough, they may be able to break off a losing battle.&#10;&#10;Thrown into the mix are random events cards, but the game is not card driven. Each player can hold a hand of up to 10 cards, which can be played in nearly any combination and at any time (except during combat continuation). You use the cards to enhance your units or mess with the other player (ie. Grant steals a march - all Union units +2 MP this turn, or Rain - 1 left shift on all attacks) Others are one time events (Sedwick gets killed, Jackson falls asleep) that will ruin your perfect plan.&#10;&#10;Each game can be picked up and learned in under 30 minutes, and played entirely through in 4 hours or less. The cards, leaders and Wilderness/Magruder tables add a level of chrome and history to the games without making them difficult. Combined with the hidden strengths and dummy counters, no two games are ever the same.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 days (IITAS)&#10;            1 turn = 1/2 day(GOR)&#10;Map Scale: Point to point movement&#10;Unit Scale:  Divisions&#10;Players: 2 players&#10;Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Two 22 X 34 inch maps- One for each game&#10;Three Countersheets&#10;Two decks of 55 playing cards (1 for each game)&#10;Two Rulebooks (1 for each game) with examples of play&#10;Player Aid cards with Charts and Tables&#10;Three 6-sided dice&#10;One Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;"

In addition to extensive historical notes, the game uses a common rules set and counters to examine the following battles:&#10;&#10;Aylesford (455)&#10;Badon (ca. 516)&#10;Camlaan (ca. 537) Two versions&#10;Arthuret (573)&#10;Deorham (577)&#10;Argoed Llwyfain (577)&#10;Alclud Ford (ca. 580)&#10;Degsastan (603)&#10;Maserfelth (641)&#10;Strathcarron (642)&#10;&#10;Scenarios are designed for two players, but a lack of hidden information makes the game highly suitable for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s Saxon versus Briton, Scot versus Northumbrian, and Penda of Mercia against everybody!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The game consists of a 102-card fortune deck, with most cards being beneficial to a player's city, such as castles, city squares, military structures, religious structures, and treasuries. However, the deck also contains barbarian horde cards of varying strength that may result in a raid.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they may choose to either hire mercenaries (if available) or add cards to the field. A player adds cards to the field by turning over cards from the fortune deck, one at a time and laying them out in the play area between all players (the field). The player may continue to add cards to the field until they choose to stop, barbarians raid the field, or eight cards are in the field. When a player chooses to stop, they then choose up to three cards from the field to add to their city. The cards are sorted in the player's city by type as the player is trying to maximize points by completing sets of the different types.&#10;&#10;Each barbarian horde card has a strength value of 1-3. A barbarian raid occurs when a player is adding cards to the field and a total of 5 or more strength points worth of barbarian horde cards is revealed. When this happens, the field is swept (all cards are removed to the discard pile) and the player's turn immediately ends.&#10;&#10;Alternately, instead of adding cards to the field, a player may choose to hire mercenaries if there are any available in the general supply. Mercenaries will help the player defend against barbarian raids by destroying barbarian horde cards in the field of equal or lesser value, just as a player's regular army cards do. A player who chooses to hire mercenaries may still collect cards from the field, if any, that were previously placed there by another player.&#10;&#10;When the fortune deck runs out and no mercenaries cards are left in the supply, the player with the most points based on all cards in their city wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

This game simulates those career paths, with senatorial factions represented by each player, during the rise of the Republic. Starting around 241-237 BC when the provinces of Sicilia and Sardinia et Corsica had been conquered through war with the Carthaginians, each turn abstracts a generation of Roman politicians competing for offices and wielding state powers, with factions leveraging their wealth and influence to increase their reputation and legacy. Senators also serve in provincial posts, protecting and developing the expanding Republic while amassing their own fame and fortune. Throughout the game players must cooperate to ensure the public&rsquo;s satisfaction with the government remains stable and the Republic remains prosperous and secure, all while competing to attain the highest status.&#10;&#10;General Course of Play: Each turn begins with die rolls triggering events in the provinces. Then elections are held where factions compete to form the strongest voting coalitions and senators claim offices in Rome and the provinces. Players then alternate taking actions that include using office powers and influencing clients, often with adverse effect on their opponents. Each turn concludes with a sequential reckoning of state and faction accounts, setting the stage for the next generation of struggle and achievement.&#10;&#10;Disclaimer: This is a updated prototype that has been play tested, but is still in development.&#10;&#10;"
