That's 536 years, which is a LOT of history! Our system uses 10 year turns for a total of 54 turns. During these turns, the Romans (and Parthians/Sassanids) will create their empire, try to maintain it, and then finally defend it against many incursions.&#10;&#10;The game covers not just the Roman Empire, but the Parthian/Sassanid (Persian) Empire as well, and even one you've probably not heard of: the Kushan Empire. The map covers from Ireland (Hibernia) to India and from Tingis (Morocco) to the lands of the Huns (Kazakhstan) on the 37&quot; by 18.5&quot; vinyl-covered map.&#10;&#10;Units are included for all the peoples of Europe and Asia that were involved in the conflicts: the Celts (over 30 tribes), the Germans (tribes, migratory tribes, and Germanic Kingdoms), and over 35 other native peoples. Not only are the Huns included, but the less well-known Hunae (Hephthalites) that moved against the Sassanid Empire are as well. Two complete Roman armies are included on the four 88-counter sheets: the legions and the reformed Roman Army of the later Empire. There's even a counter for the &quot;Walls of Constantinople&quot; and counters for the numerous Civil Wars that Rome had. Leadership was important, and the best of the Roman Emperors are included, as well as the best of the Parthian and Sassanid &quot;King of Kings.&quot;&#10; Production is key to success, and the primary economic centers of Europe, Africa, and Asia are shown on the map. Gaining control of these is key to replacing your losses. The Parthians even get a boost for the profits from the Silk Road.&#10; Game Rules will be posted on-line and you can take a look at them before buying!&#10; &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.&quot; -Horace&#10;&#10;"

The Road to Ruin is set in the aftermath of a zombie infection outbreak that has left the city overrun by hordes of unstoppable zombies.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a survivor of the outbreak. On their turn, the players move their survivor around hidden locations, revealing each location and the level of zombie threat at that location.  Each of the locations is unique, and they may grant the survivor more items or weapons, allow the survivor to scavenge the location for equipment, or might be hazards that block the survivor's path.  Each of the survivors has a special ability, such as an affinity with a specific type of weapons (melee or ranged), general combat proficiency, extra health, or move versatile movement.&#10;&#10;The survivors fight the zombies as they explore each location.  In combat, the players roll two six-dice and then use their survivor's weapons and items to attempt to beat the zombie's threat level (which is between 7 and 11).  Equipped weapons allow the player to reroll, melee weapons give one reroll and ranged weapons give two rerolls but require matching ammunition.  If the survivor fails to fight of the zombie, they are wounded.  Each survivor can take on a few wounds before they eliminated.  However, survivors can use medical items to remove wounds, and can even discard items in combat to gain more rerolls in a last ditch effort to stay alive.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to recover multiple supply items and to bring these back to the safe house location before the survivors fall to the zombies.  The Road to Ruin comes with four scenarios.  The basic scenario 'Supply Run' mentioned above lays out the game's 25 locations in a 5x5 grid and tasks the survivors with recovering six supply items.  Other scenarios use different layouts to create varied challenges, including one where the survivors must use a radio at a specific location to call for rescue and then reach the airport location to win.  Each of the scenarios also has an easy variation, which usually requires fewer items to be recovered.&#10;&#10;"

A strength chit is drawn during combat to determine the exact combat value of the unit; the strength chit once pulled is hidden under the unit to increase the &quot;fog of war&quot;.  The Second Battle of Kharkov is the perfect gaming situation to entice players into the world of strength chits.&#10;&#10;Spring Prelude is a simulation of the failed Soviet offensive to recapture that city, and the subsequent German counterattack, during the spring of 1942, which produced the last great pocket of Soviet prisoners.  Players conduct operations as either Soviet Direction Commander Semyon Timoshenko, or as the German commander of Army Group South, Fedor von Bock.&#10;&#10;The game is based primarily on &quot;Kharkov 1942: Anatomy of a Military Disaster&quot; by David Glantz, with some order of battle enhancement by George Nafziger, and maps based on post-war USGS surveys (which were themselves taken from wartime Soviet surveys).&#10;&#10;It's a battle not often covered by other titles, and features actions where both sides were attacker and defender.&#10;&#10;The game scale is 3 miles per hex and one day per turn.  Units are primarily German regiments and Soviet divisions.  Components include two 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps (total area 44&quot;x34&quot;), and 700 1/2&quot; counters, including over 350 units.&#10;&#10;Scenarios include:&#10;&#10;1. Northern Pincer: This historical scenario uses a portion of one map as an introduction to the full campaign. It provides players a look at one thrust of a two-part plan designed to capture Kharkov. The goal of this scenario is to study the true threat to German intentions posed by the Soviet forces east of the city. Lasts 6 turns (12-17 May), one map.&#10;&#10;2. Izyum Salient: This is the full historical campaign, covering both offensives, as the battle flows back and forth across the steppe. You can use all the bells and whistles for this one. Lasts 16 turns (12-27 May), both maps.&#10;&#10;3. Aggressive Timoshenko: This is a hypothetical situation that assumes the Soviets are ready to attack on the original planned kick-off date. The scenario plays the same as the historical campaign, but is shifted to 8 days earlier. The initial setup is slightly modified and some German reinforcements take longer to arrive. Lasts 20 turns (4-23 May), both maps.&#10;&#10;4. Passive Timoshenko: This is another hypothetical situation that places the Soviets on a stronger footing. The scenario postulates that Timoshenko did not propose his attack plans to Stalin who himself was more occupied with other sections of the front. In this case, FRIDERICUS is launched as planned by the Germans against a dug-in and defensive-minded Soviet force. Will there still be a pocket? Lasts 10 turns (18-27 May), one map.&#10;&#10;New rules include:&#10;&#10;&bull; The effect of rain, mud, and swollen rivers on the early stages of the battle.&#10;&bull; Stacking of Soviet units is different than that of Axis units.&#10;&bull; The addition of headquarters is used to portray the Soviet command structure in a more accurate way.&#10;&bull; Air missions are expanded to cover interdiction sorties.&#10;&bull; Soviet doctrine restrictions reflect the rigidity of the Soviet command structure in the early years of the war.&#10;&#10;The game designer, Greg Blanchett, has a folder on Consimworld (http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dd4d844/831).&#10;&#10;"

You collect the parts and take them back to your ship to repair it and escape the aliens. At the end of each turn you will draw an Alien card that tells which tile an alien lands on. When moving to a tile with aliens the player 'pushes' the aliens off that tile onto surrounding tiles. Anytime a tile has 4 or more aliens, the aliens destroy that tile (flip it over) and scatter to the adjacent tiles. This can lead to chain reaction where one tile being destroyed causes more tiles to be overloaded with aliens and destroyed.&#10;&#10;"

They initially each have five lives and three rights to the throne. Each round, they secretly choose other player or the current King, who is not a player, as a poisoning target.&#10;&#10;The most chosen player is poisoned and loses one life, but has a chance to retaliate. If that player correctly names a player who chose the poisoned player, the poisoned player steals one right to the throne from the named player or forces the named player lose one life. If the retaliation is unsuccessful, the named player does the same to the poisoned player.&#10;&#10;If at least one player chose the King, the King loses one life, and if the King's life is reduced to zero, the game ends and the player with the most rights to the throne is crowned as the new King.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hidden special ability. The game may change drastically when the ability is revealed and activated.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

The game takes 30-60 minutes to play, depending on experience and number of players.&#10;&#10;Gut Check draws on elements from a number of games including Pandemic, Magic: The Gathering, and Dominion. While the game plays equally well with 2, 3, or 4 players the strategy changes in each case.  Optimal play revolves around hand management, card cycling, striking a balance between building your own microbiome or playing cards to interfere with opponents, and timing various events.&#10;&#10;"

Designed for 2&ndash;4 players, the game invites players to take on the roles of various alternate-universe versions of Bill and Ted, racing through time in a phone booth to collect historical figures for a most triumphant school report.&#10;&#10;Players must navigate the Circuits of Time, a modular board representing different historical eras. Each player programs their movement in advance by playing direction cards face-down. However, the more historical figures they pick up, the more unpredictable their movement becomes&mdash;making time travel increasingly challenging. In addition to racing against other players, players must avoid two &quot;villain&quot; standees who roam the board and may cause characters to be lost or reshuffled.&#10;&#10;The game combines accessible rules with chaotic strategy, encouraging players to plan carefully while embracing the absurdity of time travel. Thematically rich and humorously illustrated, the game evokes the irreverent tone of the movie, with each historical figure portrayed in a cartoon style reminiscent of the film&rsquo;s zany spirit.&#10;&#10;The first player to successfully return to San Dimas with the required historical figures wins the game&mdash;and hopefully passes their history class with flying colors.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;Robo Rally &ndash; Both games feature programmed movement and chaotic navigation, although RoboRally emphasizes obstacle-laden factory floors while Bill &amp; Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Boardgame focuses on time travel and character collection.&#10;&#10;Gravwell: Escape from the 9th Dimension &ndash; Features movement that depends on the state of the board and may change unexpectedly, much like the increasingly erratic phone booth in Bill &amp; Ted.&#10;&#10;Dragon Delta/River Dragons &ndash; Players pre-program their moves to race across a dynamic board while interfering with each other, resulting in frequent unexpected outcomes&mdash;much like the wild time-travel hijinks of Bill &amp; Ted.&#10;&#10;"
