This game follows the theory proposed by Japanese historian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, who wrote that it was the Soviet declaration of war, and not the atomic bomb, what finally led the Japanese to surrender. August Storm plays with the what-if possibility that the Japanese government delayed for a few weeks the decision to surrender because the military believed that they could successfully defend the Kuril and Hokkaido with the resources at hand, and because the Soviets lacked the experience and equipment needed for launching such a complex operation as an amphibious landing. In fact, the dismal performance of the Soviet amphibious attack against Shumshu Island seemed to confirm the idea that they could resist a Soviet amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;First published with Command Magazine Japan #142 in August 2018.&#10;&#10;"

An insect will move either one, two, three, or four spaces (nodes) according to a die roll.  The first player to get all five insects across the board into opposite spaces is the winner.  Sometimes a spider comes up on the die; when this happens, the player draws a card and rotates the web according to the card's instructions.  Therefore the players face a changing board as they try to get across the web.&#10;&#10;The advanced game is more interesting:  one player takes the role of spider in a contest between a single spider and up to four other players.  The players still try to get their insects across the board, and the board will still rotate now and then.  A player wins when just three insects make it to the opposite side.  The spider can jump around the outside of the board, or can also generate a web rotation, always looking to get close enough to the insects to devour one.  The spider has to capture three insects of the same color to win.&#10;&#10;The die is six-sided with opposite faces:  1-spider, 2-spider, 3-4.  There are 10 cards which indicate a spin of 1 space, 10 with a spin of 2 spaces, and 10 with a spin of 3 spaces.  Half the cards indicate a clockwise direction, and half indicate a counter-clockwise direction (distributed evenly amongst the spin amounts).&#10;&#10;"

If it had been two men wrestling, it would have been called a 'dog fall.' Both sides claim victory&mdash;both whipped.&quot; -&thinsp;Private Sam Watkins, 1st Tennessee Infantry&#10;&#10;In September, Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi out-maneuvered Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio and invaded Kentucky. Although victorious in two battles, Bragg found his army out of position, low on supplies, and with no more than 1,000 Kentuckians joining the ranks. Buell was forced to seek out Bragg although his army was inexperienced. Outside Perryville, the two armies blundered into each other. A short but brutal battle followed that left neither side satisfied. The Union failed to utilize their numerical advantage, while Bragg withdrew from Kentucky. The result was a narrow Union victory, although Buell was removed from command and middle Tennessee was again in Confederate hands.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;This army does not retreat.&rdquo; - George Thomas when asked if the XIV Corps should retreat from Stones River&#10;&#10;The next time Bragg would face the Army of the Ohio, both opponents had new names. The Rebels dubbed their force the Army of Tennessee and the Union called theirs the XIV Corps. The Union was led by William Rosecrans, one of the war's best commanders. With offensives in Virginia and Mississippi failing, Rosecrans was pressured into making a premature winter push. At Stones River near Murfreesboro the armies fought a three day battle. The Confederates nearly won, but were forced back. The defeat relinquished some of the best farmland in Tennessee and an area that was heavily pro-Confederate. More importantly, the defeat led to a series of recriminations in the Confederate high command that poisoned the army. The Union received a desperately needed morale boost. Although forgotten today, Abraham Lincoln considered Stones River one of the North's most crucial victories.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rally 'Round the Flag!&quot; is a brigade grand tactical system that combines old school hex and counter maneuvers with rules for command and control, leader personalities, flexible artillery, and a CRT that favors quality and firepower over raw mass. For Perryville (Battle in the Bluegrass) there are rules for Union high command confusion and Joseph Wheeler's cavalry screen. For Stones River (Winter of Discontent) there are rules for Cheatham being drunk and Rosecrans coming under fire. Both come with multiple scenarios, including additional forces. Players can make Perryville a grand decisive battle or at Stones River bring in additional Confederate forces that could decide the battle and the war.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Game Scale: Approx. 0.25 miles/hex = approx. 440 yards/hex = approx. 402 metres/hex.  1 hour/turn.&#10;&#10;Perryville map: 10 inches by 15 inches. &#10;Stones River (Murfreesboro) map: 15 inches by 18 inches.&#10;The two maps are separate maps.&#10;&#10;"

While working with your fellow agents to solve a murder may be nothing new, the introduction of a conspiracy card means that you have a chance to be part of the summoning of a monster. While investigating, if you figure that out, it is your solemn duty to aid the monster. Will the Fallen Angel call on you for redemption, or are you already a pawn of the Vampire? Each player has six turns, shown by the heat die, to figure this out.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is straightforward.  You take an action and then move, or move and then take an action.  Actions consist of investigating, meaning picking up a green, red or blue skill die, rolling however many you've collected of that color, and then checking the reference card.  &quot;Calling it in&quot; where you help or hinder your fellow agents by announcing how, who, or what, or making a raid on a cult compound, or monster lair.&#10;&#10;Because of how easy setup is, and how quick gameplay is, this is the perfect game to share with friends.

As the captain of one of his ships, you must get your crew home to Ithaca, but complete a series of missions on the way home, whilst the Gods will Bless and Curse your ship.&#10;&#10;Will you make it home wealthy, will you make it home at all?&#10;&#10;&#10;Voyage home is an adventure game where you must sail your ship home after completing a series of quests!  The other players are also trying to do the same thing, but each player will also play the part of the GODS.  Some of the Gods are out to destroy enemy ships whilst other GODS are out to help your ship! Some Blessings, Curses and other effect spells are working in great combination with each other to help you complete the game before everyone else!&#10;&#10;&#10;Gameplay Detail - The game is divided into two ACTS.  ACT I is the main part of the game, ACT II is the end game, which may not involve all of the players.ACT I has X amount of turns, which is dictated by 10 &quot;oversized&quot; cards that are on display at all times on the table, they are randomly sorted before the game starts so that only one is visible at a time.   Once all the &quot;oversized&quot; cards have been exhausted then the game goes to ACT II which is a sudden death ending to the game.&#10;&#10;Phase 1 is made up of a card draw phase where players can choose to draw cards from the GODS deck (which makes up their hand during the game which allows the players to also play the part of the Gods themselves, they can play blessings and curses as well as effect cards that effect either other players ships, their own ships, other players, areas on the map or the general gameplay state (called Global effects).  Phase one usually takes around 20 seconds.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 is the Card playing phase where each player will choose which cards they want to play and then play them.  There is a special order that cards are played in and a player order so players must all choose which cards they're playing first for that turn before all the cards are revealed.  During this phase any and all cards that are played will also be resolved if possible.  It's good to make up combos of cards in your hand, and then play them all at once, so that you can propel your ship more quickly through the quests. This is the most lengthy phase of the game.  Some players may have larger hand sizes and will take some time to work out what they're going to play, and once cards have been played they need to be actioned.  This could take 3 or 4 minutes per player to work through, depending on how experienced players are at the game and how many players there actually are.&#10;&#10;Phase 3 is the movement phase where you will each roll your dice and move your ship across the map.  You need to complete all 6 quests before you can head back to Ithaca.  It doesn't necesarrily have to be ACT II for you to be travelling home to Ithaca if you have been so successful to have completed everything before then.  However, it's quite unlikely that you'd be heading back so soon, considering the temperament of the Gods after all.  Movement is important as other players can't land on the same spot as you, and ports can only be visited by two ships at once.  Player order plays a reasonable role on how effective your movement phase is going to be, as does your dice roll.  You can skip your movement phase to instead draw off a SHIP deck (another deck of cards) which enables you to upgrade your ship to enhance your ability in some aspect or another. Although movement itself is done in player order, it shouldn't take more than a minutes for each player to work out where to move their ship to once they've rolled their movement dice.&#10;&#10;Phase 4 is cleanup.  You will remove one of the &quot;oversized&quot; cards if required (which reduces the length of the game, you will also perform any other cleanup actions (some cards require you to perform actions during this phase.  Then the player 1 ICON is rotated clockwise, so each players number order changes for the next turn.  This phase isn't very complex and is usually over in a minute or so.  It usually just involved an oversize card being removed and all the cards that got played this turn being discarded to the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Quests and finishing the game:  Each ship must complete all 6 quests before being able to return to Ithaca.  Each ship must closely monitor it's supplies (which keep the crew well fed!) and crew number as well as its riches (GOLD!) as this may become very important as you endeavor to finish the game before time runs out!&#10;&#10;To win you must be one of the players who made it back for starters!  If players have not completed all 6 quests when ACT I ends, then they're lost at sea and take no further part in the game.  There is some sudden death rules that effect the remaining players but as long as you make it back you have a chance to win! The amount of crew is the first factor in deciding a winner, whilst Gold is the secondary factor, but usually a winner is obvious!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Become the richest.&#10;&#10;In Star Pioneer you play intrepid pioneers seeking out new riches in the great expanse of unknown space.&#10;&#10;You will explore new regions, trade with newly discovered inhabited worlds, search for mineral deposits and manufacture super commodities from strange new materials.&#10;&#10;With some luck and careful strategy you will be become the richest pioneer in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;The Basics&#10;&#10;You start with 100,000 Galactic Dollars (GD) and your rocket on a map card. As you play you will lay down new map cards expanding the playing area. Most map cards will provide a new opportunity to earn money and you'll get some money just for exploring.&#10;&#10;Planet map cards will let you trade one of 3 commodities; water, food and ore. By buying at planets where the price is low and selling at planets where the price is high you'll make a profit. Easy! But be warned that the prices are not fixed. When any player buys or sells, the price will go up or down due to demand. Additionally, prices have a chance to fluctuate on their own, this can happen locally on a single planet or galactically for a single resource. A good trade route won't stay open for long, but without risk there is no reward.&#10;&#10;Planets also have resource points that let you buy resource cards. These are expensive long-term investments as you'll need two or more before you can make a profit from them. There are also only a limited number of resource points, so make sure you get them before your fellow players. The investment can be worth it as a good hand of 3 or 4 resource cards can win you the game.&#10;&#10;Mineral Deposit map cards offer good earning opportunities for those feeling lucky. The smaller mineral lodes are easier to find than the big ones. You could spend several turns just floating in space looking at rocks before hitting the mother lode.&#10;&#10;The player who reaches 1,000,000 Galactic Dollars first wins, so don't spare the rocket fuel and get earning if you want to be the best Star Pioneer!&#10;&#10;(Rules Summary)&#10;&#10;There are 24 hexagonal map cards, each divided into three lozenge-shaped movement spaces. There are 2 blanks, 4 wormholes, 8 planets, and 10 mineral deposits. In a four-player game, the starting map consists of two side-by-side planet cards.&#10;&#10;The three Commodities on each planet (Ore (red), Food (green), and Water (blue)) have prices indicated by a correspondingly coloured die (1 to 6), in units of 10,000 GD. Additionally, each planet (except the starting one(s)) have D3 Resource Points (yellow), indicated by Resource tokens.&#10;&#10;On a player turn, they first roll two dice. If the total is 7, reroll the Commodity prices of the closest planet(s). If a double was rolled, there is a 'Galactic Crash' of a specific Commodity (1-2 Ore, 3-4 Food, 5-6 Water). Reroll the Commodity price of the affected commodity on all planets.&#10;&#10;Next, the player moves their ship, up to 3 spaces. Wormhole spaces are connected to all the other Wormholes on the map. If they explore (move off the map), they draw and place a map card, oriented as they wish. This earns the player 10,000 GD.&#10;&#10;Finally, the player can perform one action (out of 3 possible ones).&#10;&#10;The player could Prospect if on a Mineral Deposit space. These are rated from 1 to 5. When Prospecting, the player must roll greater than that number to find the mineral deposit. If unsuccessful, nothing happens. Otherwise, the player earns 50,000 GD times the Mineral Deposit's size, and the Deposit is marked as exhausted (black token).&#10;&#10;The player could Trade if on a planet. A player's ship can carry up to 3 Commodity tokens. If the Commodity price is 2 or less, the player can only buy. Once the player has bought or sold, the price is adjusted. If the player sold, the price goes down 1 (but no lower than 3); if they bought, the price goes up 1 (but no higher than 6).&#10;&#10;Finally, the player could buy a Resource Card if on a planet with remaining Resource tokens. The player pays 50,000 GD, removes one Resource token, and draws a Resource Card. You can only buy one at a time.&#10;&#10;Resource cards are used to make Super Commodities. At any time during their turn, a player can reveal 2 or more Resource Cards to produce a Super Commodity. Its value is the sum of the base numbers on the cards multiplied by the highest multiplier on the cards. The Resource Cards are then discarded.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

If someone's ribbon gets tangled, they'll be out of the running! Sewing Circle is part of The Stocking Stuffer Collection.&#10;&#10;Sewing Circle is an 18 card microgame . Your goal is to be the player who avoids tangling their ribbon. 12 cards are placed onto the table in a circle, with the 6 remaining cards being divided evenly among the players. Each player decides which color ribbon will represent them, and the first player to choose will go first.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple- keep your line unbroken. If your turn ends and your line is broken, you lose. Every turn you must flip a card in the circle face-up, then you may swap a face up-card with its neighbor, and then you may exchange any face-up card with a card in your hand.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you'll have to plan your moves so that while untangling your ribbon you tangle your opponents' ribbon as well. Causing multiple tangles means they'll have to spend their turn dealing with them and can limit their options in tangling things up for you. Choosing the best cards to flip on your turn and making sure the cards in your hands have different lines on them can be important as well. If you can plan multiple steps ahead you can improve your chances even more.&#10;&#10;Sewing circle also includes a solo/cooperative mode, where players must keep all three ribbons from getting tangled. If any ribbon is tangled at the end of any player's turn they all lose.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players seek to accumulate gold and bonds (the value of which varies according to the progress each side in the war). Players can choose to invest money in arms factories, which give them more bonds and greater influence over the outcomes; simply speculate; or buy up businesses such as coffin makers and hope for a bloody and prolonged conflict. Ultimately the only thing that matters is the final amount of cash in hand when the war ends.&#10;&#10;The game lasts between three and seven turns, in each of which players first make their investment and production decisions, and then (in reverse order) contribute troops to the outcome of one of the great battles of the US Civil War. The battles are simply resolved and allow for a bit of bluff and negotiation, but they do not attempt to replicate the tactics of the conflict. Those looking for a simulation of &quot;Pickett's Charge&quot; at Gettysburg should probably not buy this game.&#10;&#10;The game is fast paced and highly interactive as the ability to anticipate or influence other players' strategies is crucial to victory.
