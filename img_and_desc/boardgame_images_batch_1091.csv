In more detail, the game board shows a map of a city with certain locations being connected by colored paths. Each player starts with four colored parade float cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two locations, and you're trying to connect those two locations with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either draw two parade float cards from the deck or discard parade float cards to claim a route between two locations by placing your ghost trains on it; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long). If you connect the two locations shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket. (If you can't connect locations on either ticket because the paths are blocked, you can take your entire turn to discard those tickets and draw two new ones.)&#10;&#10;If you create a route all the way from the Dark Forest region to the Seashore region, you collect the &quot;trick or treat&quot; bonus.&#10;&#10;"

Can the trial commissioner and jurors identify the scandal-mongerer?&#10;&#10;Lying Lips reflects the importance of words in the witch hunts: accused witches often had a reputation for slandering or cursing others.

In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.&#10;&#10;If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &ndash; receives three cards.

Unfortunately, only one of you will be allowed to leave the city with his/her &laquo; new &raquo; memories. To be the chosen one, you&rsquo;ll have to tell a memory or a lie while messing up with your companions&rsquo; minds.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to tell a memory based on random pictures. If you don&rsquo;t remember any memory with these pictures, you can still bluff creating a false memory, but try to be convincing! Indeed, to score points when you are the Speaker, you have to mislead the other players (in other words you must make them believe your memory is false when in fact it is true, or true when it is actually false).&#10;&#10;ROUND 1&#10;IN THE HEART OF THE CITY&#10;You penetrate the heart of Memoria city. Snatches are springing up everywhere. Choose carefully the ones you&rsquo;ll associate to tell or reinvente your story.&#10;1) Everybody has 90 seconds to remember or to imagine a memory with the six visible cards (you can use your phone timer or leave it up to players to decide when they are ready to tell a memory). You don&rsquo;t have to include the whole six cards to your memory. It is possible to tell a memory using only one card out of the six ones you picked.&#10;&#10;2) Once everybody&rsquo;s ready, the older player is designated as the Speaker. Then, he places in front of him and face down his &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card if he&rsquo;s going to lie or his &laquo; Memoria &raquo; card, if he&rsquo;s going to tell the truth. Then, he declares the number of pictures he&rsquo;ll use in his memory and then tells it.&#10;&#10;3) Once his memory has been told, each player (beginning with the player who is placed on his left) can ask a question to the Speaker if he wants to, in order to gather more information, or to unsettle him to see how he&rsquo;ll react (If the Speaker&rsquo;s memory is true, he has to answer the questions honestly. If his memory is false, he can tell what he wants).&#10;&#10;4) Then, each player has to decide if the Speaker&rsquo;s memory was true or false, placing his Memoria or Bluff card in front of him (His Memoria card if he thinks it was true, his Bluff card, if he thinks it was a lie).&#10;&#10;5) Then, beginning with the player placed on the Speaker&rsquo;s left, each player reveals his card, explaining if he wants to, why he believed or not in the Speaker&rsquo;s memory. Then, the Speaker shows his own &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card et gives some details about his story if he wants to.&#10;&#10;6) Then, you have to count the points (see the following paragraph &laquo; How to count points &raquo;).&#10;&#10;7) Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&rsquo;s been Speaker once.&#10;&#10;8) Once the round is over, the 6 used &laquo; Snatch &raquo; cards are discarded.&#10;&#10;ROUND 2&#10;ON YOUR WAY BACK&#10;It&rsquo;s time to go back. You and your adventure fellows are about to leave the city of Memoria. Some snatches are still springing but soon, everything will turn back to the way it was before entering the city... However, one of you will have the privilege to keep in mind his new memories. But who ?&#10;&#10;1) The Speaker draws the first &laquo; Snatch &raquo; card from the deck and has 45 seconds to remember or imagine a memory linked to this card.&#10;&#10;2) He puts his &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card in front of him and tells his memory.&#10;&#10;3) The other players use their &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card to decide if the Speaker&rsquo;s memory was true or false. Contrary to the first round, they can&rsquo;t ask him any questions.&#10;&#10;4) The Speaker scores 3 points for each player who was wrong about his memory. The other players scores 3 points if they were right about the Speaker&rsquo;s memory.&#10;&#10;5) The drawn &laquo; Snatch &raquo; card is discarded and replaced with another one. Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&rsquo;s been Speaker twice during this round.&#10;&#10;6) The game is over ! It&rsquo;s time for you and your fellows to leave Memoria city. The one who has the highest score keeps his new memories with him.

After capturing two river forts and the largest bag of prisoners ever captured by an American army to that time, Grant made a daring advance up the Tennessee River, while supporting armies advanced down the Mississippi and overland through Tennessee. But the Confederate army under A.S. Johnston hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.&#10;&#10;GRANT: The Western Campaign of 1862 puts you in charge of the entire Tennessee campaign. As the Union player, you must coordinate three armies, using both naval and land forces to advance along the major rivers, take the important objectives of Nashville and Corinth, and seize the fortress of Island Number Ten to open the Mississippi River. As the Confederate player you are trying to block the Union offensives, choose your moment to counterattack, and if possible, take the war into Kentucky. Movement and combat by river is just as important as land, giving this campaign a unique feel in Civil War history. A chit-based sequence of play makes the game highly variable and models the abilities of Grant and Johnston.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

On June 6, 1982 the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon in an operation dubbed &ldquo;Peace for Galilee&rdquo;. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) quickly defeated the PLO&rsquo;s armed forces and drove north. Although the declared aim of the Israeli offensive was to clear a 40 kilometer &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; along the Lebanese/Israeli border, Israeli Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, was determined to eradicate the PLO once and for all, and hopefully kill its leader, Yassir Arafat. With new orders the IDF crossed the Litani River and drove on Beirut where the remnants of the PLO&rsquo;s forces were retreating, and where most of their refugee camps were located. What ensued was an escalating conflict that threatened to engulf the entire mid-east once more in conflict and bring Lebanon to the brink of abyss of genocidal civil war.&#10;&#10;Each copy of Operation Iron Brain is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets&#10;&bull;    One sheet of 140 double-sided, unmounted counters&#10;&bull;    One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet&#10;&bull;    8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Armor and Infantry (Militia, Regular, Heavy Weapons) units are all Battalions.

Each turn, players alternate their actions to adapt their strategies to their opponents' moves and the expansion of the board.

At the end of each turn, they have to choose a new card to improve their personal deck as their clans develop new tactics and technologies.&#10;&#10;The conquest of Northgard also requires clever management of resources to build new buildings, improve your warriors' effectiveness, better your hand of cards, and upgrade your clan's specificities. The winter phase makes this management more difficult as you have to feed your units to keep them healthy and happy.&#10;&#10;The pace of the game is set by the players as the game ends after seven turns, but can also be cut short at any time if one of them is in control of three closed territories hosting certain types of buildings.&#10;&#10;'--description from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;"

Shuffle your deck, then lay one card face up and take four cards in hand. On a turn, you must play one card from your hand that matches the number or color of the card on top of your pile &mdash; but if the card you would play matches the top card of your left- or right-hand neighbor's discard pile, then you must play it there instead!&#10;&#10;Maybe you can choose a card in hand that matches only your top card? If you have no valid play or don't want to give points away to someone else, you can play the card face down on your stack, showing the hero on the card back. On your next turn, you can play any card you like on your pile &mdash; except if it matches a neighbor's top card, of course, in which case you must give it away. (You can't play on a neighbor's hero card.) Whatever you do, refill your hand to four cards at turn's end.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been played, everyone scores for the cards in their pile &mdash; but first they must count the number of hero cards in their pile. However many heroes they have, they must remove all matching number cards prior to scoring. If you have four heroes, for example, you must discard all 4s &mdash; and this is bad since all cards score points equal to their value. If you have nine heroes, then you first discard all 6s, then all 3s. Whoever has the most points wins!&#10;&#10;Disney Villains: The Card Game includes two special cards that each player can shuffle into their deck prior to play. (Reshuffle if you flip up a special card initially.) When you play a special card, discard it to the center of the table instead of playing it on your pile. Here's what these cards do:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Maleficent &mdash; Curse: All players with the highest number on their pile discard those cards to the center of the table.&#10;    Cruella de Ville &mdash; Exchange: Exchange your top card (whether hero or number) with the top card of another player's pile.&#10;    Ursula &mdash; Whirlpool: Decide whether all players pass their topmost card to the player on their left or right.&#10;    Captain Hook &mdash; Interfere: All players must flip their top card from number to hero or vice versa.&#10;    Jafar &mdash; Hypnosies: Take the top card of another player's pile and add it to your hand.&#10;    Scar &mdash; Intrigue: Draw a card at random from each player's hand and place it in front of them.
