A limited amount of decks printed in professional-grade quality was sold on Christmas 2016.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to draw cards from a pile and avoid cards labeled with an evil, mutant ape by neutralizing them with a &quot;battle&quot; card. If an ape card cannot be neutralized, the player looses. The number of battle cards in the game decreases over time. The last player still standing wins.&#10;&#10;Additional action cards can give an individual player and advantage over others, for example:&#10;&#10;- The &quot;future zombie&quot; card allows a player to look at and reshuffle the top three cards of the drawing pile.&#10;&#10;- The &quot;fight&quot; card allows a player to challenge an other player to a side competition (e.g. arm wrestling, throwing darts, drinking etc.). The winner may then take one of the loosers' cards.&#10;&#10;- The &quot;downfall&quot; card moves all &quot;ape&quot; cards in the game to the top of the drawing pile.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two to five players, but is most fun with four or five players.&#10;&#10;"

Players are sociopathic dictators trying to dismantle the world to profit themselves and their friends, all the while trying to keep one step ahead of government investigations. The winner is the one with the most Hubris when the world is hobbled by Nuclear War, Economic Depression, or Tribalism.&#10;&#10;All players are recently-elected populist politicians who only won their elections through corruption related to an evil empire that is hellbent on world domination. Through manipulation of the public, pointless but politically popular actions, and bald-faced lies, the players try to destroy their governments, making money from evil corporations, and stay one step ahead of government regulations and/or unpopular opinion.&#10;&#10;The game has worker placement (we call it &lsquo;scapegoating,&rsquo; as your worker may not come back) and worker-developing (like deck-building for workers), multi-purpose cards, and a lot of deception.

In A.I., corporations are trying to continue to line their pockets with the use of technology, except the technology is starting to work against that. Players are trying to profit handily while staying one step ahead of the A.I., which is starting to think of humans as a virus in the physical world.&#10;&#10;A.I.&rsquo;s key mechanism is the idea of an engine-building game with a potentially intelligent engine. In most engine-building games, players assemble an engine through the acquisition and management of resources to construct from a selection of parts. At some point in the game, the engine that will be run for the sole purpose of making victory points. The interesting decisions in these games is when to make that shift.&#10; In A.I., the engines have a chance to become sentient and could actually become part of a dummy player in the game that both hinders the ability of the player to progress and competes against all players to possibly win the game.&#10;&#10;"

Hailed as one of the toughest digital games ever, it has attracted millions of hardcore gamers. The secret behind this huge success lies not in just making an extremely difficult game. Anyone can do that. The true challenge lies in balancing it to be as difficult as possible, but still fair enough that the very best players can survive to the end. Alas, the game studio is heavily short staffed and the management is looking to hire one more Game Designer for developing more content in Black Souls.&#10;&#10;You have been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be hired by Designer Inc as a level designer, an integral part of Black Souls' development team! As one of the finalist candidates, you must prove your designing skills under the judging eyes of your future employers in an 'Early Beta Access' trial to create a level that best reflects the spirit of Black Souls - a very difficult, yet fair game. A group of seasoned playtesters will be sent to try out your carefully designed level, and provide feedback on whether they like or dislike it at the end of the run. If the level is too easy, they would not feel challenged at all. If it is too hard, they would all be killed and find it unfair. Who will be the final candidate to be inducted into the ranks of Designer Inc?&#10;&#10;This is a uniquely themed game - A game about designing a game!&#10;&#10;How To Play:&#10;&#10;All players begin the game with the same mix of party, randomly generated from a deck of Party Cards. The game is split into two phases - The Design phase, followed by the Gameplay phase.&#10;&#10;Place all tiles (also known as Assets) into the drawbag, then randomly take out an amount of Assets equal to the number of players and place them in the middle of the play area. This will be known as the Asset Pool. (Minimum Assets drawn from bag is 3, even if it is only 2 players)&#10;&#10;Players then secretly select one of their 6 Bid Cards (valued 1 - 6) and reveal them at the same time. In descending order with highest bid value first, players take turns to pick an Asset from the Pool. Players must immediately place their newly acquired Assets onto their own individual player boards. They can choose to place the Asset on any of the 3 available levels. When placing on levels 1 and 3, the Asset must be placed in the leftmost empty space of that level. If the player decides to put it on level 2, the Asset must be placed in the rightmost empty space of that level.&#10;&#10;On each Bid Card, there is also a secondary effect that will occur. Much of the game's strategies revolve around cleverly using these effects at the right time. The value 1 card allows a player to place a Tavern on the newly acquired Asset, while the value 2 card allows a player to immediately add 1 party member with the type based on a card draw from the Party deck. Value 3 allows one to take back all his previously played Bid Cards, including that card itself. When value 3 is played, all other players must place their newly acquired Asset face-down! Value 4 allows one to add one more Asset from the drawbag to the Pool when it is his turn to pick, and value 5 allows one to swap the positions of two previously placed Assets. Value 6 allows a player to place a Shrine on the newly acquired Asset. On a tie (more than 1 player playing the same value Bid Card), both players go last! (Even if they both played a 6) On top of that, their Bid Cards' secondary effects do not trigger too! Value 3's secondary ability will always trigger, even if tied.&#10;&#10;All players do have a Hack skill they can each use twice per game, which allows them to avoid losing the effect of secondary abilities during ties as well as keeping their bid numbers instead of going last. Between the tied players, the play order follows the previous turn. If player A and B tied, and player B had her turn before A in the previous turn, she will continue to have her turn before A in this new turn. If players tie in the first turn of the game, the play order ascends from the youngest first.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Assets belong to three types - Cave, Dungeon, and Outdoor. Players will gain bonus points if they can chain and connect more Assets of the same type together.&#10;&#10;After 12 turns of Design phase, all players' boards should be filled completely with 12 Assets each. The Gameplay phase will then begin. This is when all players' parties start from their leftmost Asset on the first level, and work their way forward until the last Asset on the rightmost space of level 3. All Assets in the game have 4 values - The first value shows how many fighters will die in that Asset, the second shows how many mages will die, the third shows how many healers will die and the fourth shows a rating of how difficult the Asset is. Players choose to resolve only ONE of the first three values.  Clever decision making is important to minimize death across the various classes in each party.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you must ensure that your party survives throughout the entire level to the very end (yes, the same level you designed earlier) Then you will gain bonus points for your dungeon's difficulty, as well as for every 3 dead members. Hence, the best players are the ones who can design very difficult levels but still get their party to the end. It is VERY common for entire parties to be completely wiped out though - afterall, this is Black Souls!&#10;&#10;"

It is the oldest, continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. For the first 200 years of its existence, it was controlled by Spain. The town itself was always very small and poor, but it held an important strategic position. It helped defend the treasure fleets on their way back to Spain by preventing the English and French from building their own settlements along the Gulf stream.&#10;&#10;In this game players actively recruit townsfolk, earn gold, gain military glory, and build structures while being mercilessly subjected to hurricanes, raids, disease, and hostile indians.&#10;&#10;Each turn is equal to about a decade.

It uses the mechanic known in Japanese gaming as 'butting', where equal values negate each other and the next player down gains.&#10;&#10;Each player acts as an owner of a Cabaret, and headhunts dancers. Dancers have three needs: Fame, Money and Love. For each dancer dealt up from the deck each round, players try to negotiate to get the dancer to join their troup.&#10;&#10;Negotiation is done by simultaneous blind-bidding on one of the dancer's needs. Each player chooses a card of one type and places it face down. When the three cards are turned up, the player who didn't match the others wins the bid and takes the dancer to their tableau. For example, Alice and Brenda bid on Fame, Cathy bid on Money, so Cathy wins the bid. When the game ends, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Dancers may have special abilities. Some may be triggered when turned up from the deck, some may have one-off effects when placed on your tableau, some may have permanent effects. There is also a &quot;management policy&quot; card which is drafted before the first round, and activated before counting points at the end.

You colonize habitable planets, research technologies, and build a military with which to wage war. The civilization that colonizes the most planets emerges victorious and rules the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Helios Expanse was inspired by a vision to develop a board game that provided a 4X play experience in under sixty minutes, and the play experience was crafted to be as satisfying for the traditional 4X gamer as it is for the casual gamer. This vision drove a specific set of design goals that would serve as the foundation for the game design. First and foremost, the game was created around the goal of being teachable in less than five minutes. This specific goal drove a streamlined decision tree resulting in simple, but tactical player choices turn to turn. An emphasis was placed on player interaction to preserve the game play tension typically associated with a 4X play experience. Ultimately, this combination of foundational design goals (along with a few others) led to an action/movement programming game mechanism that created just the right amount of tension turn-to-turn. At its core, Helios Expanse is a highly interactive game with simple, but tactical decisions and cohesive, working mechanisms.&#10;&#10;"

These cards are chosen based on the player's choice on elements such as high number, HUT colour etc).&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;&#10;1. At their turns, players try to eliminate other player's BAIT by placing a higher number HUT (with the same colour) on the BAIT to be eliminated.&#10;&#10;For instance, if a PLAYER has baits with number 9, 9, 8, 7, 8, an active player (player whose turn it is) who places a card with higher number of the same colour as the BAIT collects the BAIT and other cards on it if BAITS has been HEXED, DEFENDED or INVADED (see below).&#10;&#10;HEX:&#10;&#10;Players can use their turn to HEX any BAIT (either theirs or another players). They do so by placing ANOTHER HUT COLOUR with the same number as the BAIT to change the colour. This is a very important in the game strategy.&#10;&#10;DEFEND:&#10;&#10;Players can DEFEND their BAIT by placing another card with HIGHER NUMBER but MUST be the same HUT colour as their BAIT. This is a strategy for defence in the game.&#10;&#10;INVADE:&#10;&#10;ACTIVE PLAYER can weaken another players BAIT by INVADING. This is done when Active Player place a card with LOWER NUMBER on another player's BAIT but must be the same COLOUR.

Yet, you are all careless, and always forget which ones you are. Also, NO table talking is allowed because you are also too proud to call each other to ask.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to show up to the battle in a unique Ranger suit, matching no other Ranger's color.  Matching another ranger simply will not do, and you will refuse to fight and just go home.  It's embarrassing.&#10;&#10;Basic rules: Players have 5 cards each in their starting hands: one card for each of the 5 costume colors (add more colored cards for more players than 5).  Choose a starting player (a lead Ranger) and everyone secretly picks a color costume to wear and puts that matching color card face down in front of them.  Starting with the leader and going clockwise, you will flip your card face up in front of you and yell &quot;[Insert color you played] RANGER GO!&quot;.&#10;&#10;If all the colors are different, you fight the threat and save the day.  If not, you take any non matching cards into your hand or discard any colors that matched another player (place the discarded card in front of you, face up, so everyone can see what color you lost).&#10;&#10;You refuse to ever experience that humiliation again and throw the costume out.  If the same color card is lost by all players, the game is impossible to win, and you instantly lose.&#10;&#10;Lastly, (this can be a variant or base rule, your choice) a Ranger will never show up in the same costume twice in a row, so for the following round you must pick a different color to play (eg., yellow, yellow, blue is not allowed, but yellow, blue, yellow is).
