To win the game, a player or team must be the first to score five goals.&#10;&#10;To set up each match, players shuffle their deck of sixty cards, their goal cards, and the communal set of 24 field cards. They lay out five fields cards in a row to create the playing surface; each field card has a number on it. Each player randomly chooses one of his goal cards and places it face-down at one end of the field. Each goal card has a 1 on it. Players then get their cards and wait for the whistle.&#10;&#10;At the same time, players start going through their decks, one card at a time. If a card is unplayable, the player places it face-up in one of two reserve stacks in front of him. A card is playable or not based on this restriction: Moving from left to right, players first need to play a 1 to cover their own goal, then they must play one or more cards that sum to the value on the leftmost field card. Once that card is covered, they play one or more cards that sum to the value on that field card. And so on.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches the opponent's goal, he flips over that goal card to reveal a picture of a goalie and a ball entering the net. He then needs to mix together all of his discards and played cards, flip them over, and start looking card-by-card for four cards that can be fit together puzzle-style to resemble the picture on the back of the goal card. The first player to do this scores a goal and keeps the opponent's goal card; if he made a mistake anywhere, he scored an own goal, so the opponent gets a goal card from him.&#10;&#10;Players then shuffle the cards and go at it once again. The first player to score five goals wins!&#10;&#10;"

The British attempted to reduce a poorly-defended German salient centered on the town of Neuve Chapelle. Plans were to expand a breakthrough and with cavalry and infantry reserves take the Aubers ridge line. However, poor communication and coordination and the weather conspired to slow the initial British successes and allowed the German army to rush reinforcements into the area. Among other game features, designer Michael W. Kennedy uses offensive artillery and defensive artillery fire, British command checks, and a unique assault combat mechanic to simulate the bloody struggle. (Sourced from the White Dog Games website.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of 14 turns which represent the three days of The Battle of Neuve Chapelle. Each day is divided into four turns with a separate night turn in between. During the day turns, both sides will fire artillery (weather permitting), move, and attack. During the night turns, both sides will dig in new trenches on the new front lines.&#10;&#10;The game simulates early trench warfare and makes prominent use of artillery and the defensive advantages of trenches. Weather conditions and British communications among the four divisions are determined randomly each turn. Each assault phase contains a defensive artillery and defensive combat phase, making defense a major component of the game.&#10;&#10;There are several hexes that have victory point values. The British win by controlling as many of these hexes as possible. The Germans win by preventing the British from achieving this objectives.&#10;&#10;"

Each Support Card features a special ability and one of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Sulu, Scott, Uhura, Chekov, Chapel, Rand, or Sarek. Some special abilities make basic actions better, such as reducing the costs of Starbase upgrades or allowing the player to trade a resource of their choice at 2:1 for a turn, while others break rules, such as protecting the player from discarding on a 7 or producing a resource when the player rolls a number that wouldn't otherwise produce for them. Players get a specific Support Card during setup based on turn order, with later players getting generally more useful abilities to compensate for early player advantage. When a player uses a Support Card ability for the first time, they may trade it in for a Support Card of their choice or keep it for a second use, but they may only trade immediately after use.&#10;&#10;"

The Fall of Rome, the Black Plague, World War 2, they were here. Ready to help usher in the end of man. United in the goal, but never the means. Because of this, either by some sort of grand plan or merely by chance, a balance has formed, preserving the time of man again and again. The Horsemen&rsquo;s individual desires to be &quot;The One&quot; to snuff the candle of mankind&rsquo;s light actually thwarting the very event they hoped to cause. Then came the Zombie Apocalypse, and again they came. War, relishing the conflict and self destruction of humans- now even after death. Famine, bringing hunger and desperation to both the living and the undead. Pestilence, with pain and suffering that could last this time even after one&rsquo;s last breath was drawn. And finally Death, savoring the slow rot of a person&rsquo;s demise more than ever before. But this time they weren&rsquo;t alone. A Fifth Horseman has also come. One that could never exist before now. A Horseman born of music, technology, and the anger of a species on the brink. Will this new Horseman break the ages old balance that has existed and finally bring about the end of us all? Or is something else at play?&#10;&#10;The Fifth Horseman is a 2 Player game where the aim is to bring about the end of man by defeating your fellow Horsemen and laying sole claim to the final Apocalypse. You accomplish this by landing various Strikes that lower your opponent&rsquo;s Life and Hand Size, as well as increasing your own. The Fifth Horseman uses 6 sided hex cards that allow each card the ability to use one of 6 different effects (Strikes). Victory is achieved when your opponent is depleted of Life points.&#10;&#10;"
