Each player is given 12 phase tiles of the same back-side color and lays them out open-faced and sorted into color, animal and item tiles. Each player starts the game with four cards in hand.&#10;In your turn you draw a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and can then, if you can make up a phase tile, lay out four cards on the table. At the end of your turn you discard a card.&#10;To complete a phase and make up the tile you must lay out four cards with the same symbol, for instance four cards with a football, and then turn over your tile showing this symbol.&#10;True to the name of the game the winner is the player who is first to turn over 10 of his 12 phase tiles.&#10;&#10;"

Comes with five characters and five sealed scenarios; stands up to replaying well.&#10;&#10;The boss stays in an octagon in the centre, and is surrounded by eight spaces that may be occupied by players, or in higher levels fire or minions. Each turn consists of a player phase and a boss phase.&#10;&#10;In the player phase, the player on turn rolls 4d6, and rerolls up to 2d6 once. The dice serve two functions: first, they designate through character-specific tables which actions (move, draw spell cards, heal, etc.) or spells you can take; second, the largest set of identical dice determines how much damage you do to the boss.&#10;&#10;In the boss phase, the boss rotates either two 45&deg; steps or to face a player. The current player rolls 3d6, discards the high die, and looks up the two lower dice in a table to determine which octants take how much damage.&#10;&#10;"

Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.&#10;&#10;Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.&#10;&#10;This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts with a basic deck of cards that they can use to purchase, or upgrade to, other, more powerful cards. Thunderstone Quest brings new play modes to the table. The game will tell a specific story with a series of pre-set dungeon tiles, monsters, heroes and support cards. Each will come with a series of mini-adventures and a story booklet that tells players what happens as they progress through the scenarios.&#10;&#10;Once players have completed the quests they will be able to enjoy great replay value with the available selection of monsters, heroes, and support cards, as well as the new dungeon tiles, by choosing random set-ups before the start of play. Aside from heroes such as wizards, fighters, rogues, and clerics, cards will include supplies that heroes need like weapons, spells, items, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;The dungeon deck is created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different hero types, so players have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;"

However, it wasn&rsquo;t long before the surprised and poorly-led Italians were in headlong retreat. Following the capture of the Italian fortress at Bardia, the Italian retreat turned into a full-scale rout. All that stood between the British and complete victory were the remnants of the Italian Strategic Reserve, the Sabratha 60th Infantry Division and the Babini Armor Group (roughly a brigade) who were dug-in at the frontier village of Mechili.

If a stretch of highway is placed well, you can place one or more cars on it to score.&#10;&#10;&#10;Description:&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game&#10;&#10;You must construct a highway and place all your cars on the highway by crossing your opponent&rsquo;s roads. The first player to place all 10 cars is the winner.&#10;&#10;Playing the Game&#10;&#10;You have three things to do during your turn.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#160; Constructing a pillar&#10;Pick a location to construct a pillar.&#10;You may freely choose the construction point as long as your pillar is reachable from the base point. A base point is the location of a pillar or junction constructed in previous turn. The height of the pillar must be 1 above or 1 below the base point. You may not construct a pillar of the same height, 2 stories above or below the height of a base point (following is an exception - 6. Constructing a Junction).&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#161; Constructing a road&#10;A new road must rest between the base point and the pillar constructed in phase &#226;&#145;&#160;.&#10;You may adjust the position of the pillar when placing a road.&#10;Roads may not cross over previously placed pillars.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#162; Placing cars on highway &#10;When conditions are met, you may place a car on the road (Refer to &ndash; 5. Conditions for Car Placement).&#10;Your turn ends with your opponent&rsquo;s judge. &#10;If there is a problem, it must be sorted out on the spot.&#10;&#10;Game goes on repeating &#226;&#145;&#160; to &#226;&#145;&#162; alternately.&#10;You may no longer adjust the position of your pillar, road or car once your opponent constructs a new pillar.&#10;&#10;Conditions for Car Placement&#10;&#10;The chance to place a car on the highway occurs only to the newest road you construct. To place a car,  your newest road must cross your opponent&rsquo;s road. There are two ways to cross your opponent&rsquo;s road: crossing over or crossing under it.&#10;&#10;When crossing over : &#10;there exist no other roads over opponent&rsquo;s road&#10;&#10;When crossing under : &#10;there exist no other roads under opponent&rsquo;s road&#10;&#10;When either of the conditions is met, you may place a car on the highway. If not, you may not place a car but may still connect the road to the next pillar.&#10;&#10;If the road crosses multiple roads, you may place multiple cars depending on the number of roads crossed.&#10;&#10;crossing over two roads at the same time&#10;crossing over and crossing under two roads at the same time&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#144;Caution&#227;&#128;&#145;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187; You may not place a car when crossing over/under your own road.&#10;&#227;&#131;&#187; You may not place a car on already constructed roads later on in the game.&#10;Keep the traffic rules and enjoy driving!&#10;&#10;Constructing a Junction&#10;The yellow pillar is called the junction. Using a junction, you may do the following.&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#160; Increase or decrease the height of the pillar by any number&#10;You may increase or decrease the height of your pillar regardless of the height of the pillar at the base point. However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.&#10;&#10;Be careful, if the road angle is too steep you&rsquo;ll have trouble placing cars!&#10;&#10;&#226;&#145;&#161; Branching out to two-ways&#10;You may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.&#10;&#10;Constructing Exit to Highway&#10;&#10;If you can ground a road safely to the table from a height of 1 pillar, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent&rsquo;s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You cannot start a new road from the exit.&#10;&#10;Penalty&#10;&#10;If you drop your opponent&rsquo;s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty. You must offer a number of pieces equivalent to the materials you dropped. Game proceeds only after the parts are fixed by the player responsible. There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;&#10;1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway&#10;The first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.&#10;&#10;2. When construction materials run out&#10;If you are out of construction materials, you must wait for your opponent to finish the next turn. If the opponent finishes the turn with no penalty, the player with no more construction materials is the loser.&#10;&#10;"

The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game&#10;Most points win!&#10;So in the normal game you will need to accumulate more points then your opponent in a 2 matchs/battles setup.&#10;There are variants but even for those most points win&#10;&#10;Resources&#10;This game as stated in the game concept, is about resources. your card/pawns, dices, re-rolls and everything else is a limited resource and you will need to think about when and when not to use them or you will quickly find yourself with any way to protect your army and lose.&#10;&#10;"
