But, It Dies With Me is different. Take a peek into the soul; the deep, dark, twisted heart of your opponent. The player that wins, will learn a secret, something never told to anyone! One player at the table has a secret, and it's about them. They've even written in down and placed it in a secret envelope on the table. Do you want to read it? WIN THE GAME. The secret can never be shared, or be repeated. That's because it's written on EDIBLE PAPER with a FOOD COLORING MARKER, and it must be EATEN to make sure the secret DIES with the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;Each player (including the player whose secret is in the game) has one six sided die and a mini coffin. Players use their coffins to hide a secret die number they've chosen, trying to be the highest or lowest unique number. That's right, no rolling of these dice. Players can choose any number from one to six. Everyone opens their coffin at the same time to see who wins each round. Choose wisely, or your number might get cancelled out!&#10;&#10;Each round there are TWO winners! One winner draws a card. The other moves their token. Players try to collect a set of four cards to form the phrase: IT - DIES - WITH - ME. OR, move their token across the six grave tiles, all the way to the SECRET ENVELOPE. Complete just one of these goals, and you win. You get to READ THE SECRET! Just remember, that secret must die with you.&#10;&#10;"

Thus each player can make no more then two sets each game.&#10;&#10;When a player has no more cards or when the deck is depleted, the game ends and players receive penalty points for all cards in hand. These are equal to the number of spots on each card, hence the name of the game. To clarify: Ace=1, 2=2, 3=3..., jack/queen/king=10 penalty points.&#10;&#10;Additional rules: The ace is always low, so cannot go behind a king of the same suit. A player may play a double, which is extremely rare. These are exactly eight connecting cards of the same suit.

This is one of only two games in the COIN series that feature three separate factions, instead of the customary four.&#10;&#10;The first faction is the Government, symbolized by the personal rule of Ferdinand Marcos, his wife Imelda, and his political cronies and military forces. Second are the Insurgents represented by the New People&rsquo;s Army (or NPA). The NPA sought a national uprising from both the urban and rural populace. Finally, the third faction are the non-violent Reformers, embodied by Aquino&rsquo;s widow, Corazon. She, along with her allies and supporters in that moment of tragedy, revived a platform of social justice and unrelenting momentum that would irrevocably change the Philippine political landscape immeasurably.&#10;&#10;For players new to the COIN Series, or for those looking to teach the the series to their friends, People Power will serve as an excellent introductory game. It was designed for simplicity and quick play, utilizing many of the basic COIN Series mechanics. The 22&quot; x 17&quot; map aids in introducing the game to a new player, as it presents only two types of terrain - Cities and Countrysides (where the latter amalgamates the rural settings of the island nation as well as much lightly-habitable terrain of jungles and mountains). Don't let the fast play and basic systems fool you, though. There are still plenty of strategic puzzles and inter-player backstabbing to be had! Also, People Power includes a new feature for the COIN Series - a Key Personality mini-hand procedure that represents the effectiveness of various generals and power brokers adding a new dimension to player actions and decisions.&#10;&#10;"

You and your fellow students train vigorously every day to improve your mind and body, but your master is ailing, and only one senshi will become the next master.

A true master must be strong in all of these, and weak in none.&#10;&#10;Senshi is a strategy game for 2-4 players that takes only 15 minutes to play! Carefully manipulate stacks of tiles that represent your four attributes: strength, agility, wisdom, and honor. Competing in a battle of wits, players will choose one of three actions each turn: study to take stacks of tiles, train to take a single tile off any stack, and test to score tiles when the time is optimal.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the tallest scoring pile of any of the four attributes at the end of the game wins; however, first the player with the shortest scoring pile is eliminated.

Their tokens go into a bag that is drawn and played from on each Player Turn. Then, players select a Guild to represent, and take turns drafting their Agents, Items, Scrolls and anything else useful for the Game. This creates their personal inventory to create their dice pool as the game evolves.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will increase their Agents and Inventory's power and influence in the game. Each die bought makes your Guilds ability to resolve threats, respond to morale loss and fight the horrors of the dark! Players dice are bought from the cards they drafted at the beginning of the game as well as a few public Agents players can recruit from.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a player's turn, they pull a token from the Threat Bag and add it to the city space furthest from Wayword. As each city space fills up, threats begin flooding closer and closer to the city of Wayword. Along the way, Civilians may be injured, cities and locations may be destroyed but the real threat comes from foes reaching Wayword. If Wayword collapses, all the players lose. The Threat Bag also includes the &quot;Big Bad&quot;, who may get so fed up with his Troop's ineffectiveness, that they show up to cause their own brand of trouble! On top of all of that, the variable Scenarios in game may affect any aspect of play, from doubling Threat Bag draws to letting threats and foes move further towards Wayword but faster.&#10;&#10;As Guilds build up their Agents and Inventory, they will defeat these baddies, stop these threats and rescue these Villagers. All of these things are worth Popularity Points (Victory Points) from the people of Wayword. If players confront and defeat the &quot;Big Bad&quot;, the game comes to an end and Wayword can rest easier!&#10;&#10;"
