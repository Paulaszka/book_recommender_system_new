Each card in a pair shows a word that is a similar-sounding anagram of the other card's word, with each word being accompanied by its own illustration.&#10;&#10;The format originates in &quot;the world's shortest column&quot; (two words ... plus two pictures) from the weekly S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung Magazin. The juxtaposition of incongruous concepts, the odd but perfectly understandable expressions for familiar concepts that often result on at least one side of the anagram, and the deadpan stock photography illustrations are all played for absurd humour.&#10;&#10;This sort of memory based on playing with words is more difficult than the usual one. The funny images displaying these words add to the fun.&#10;&#10;"

Each planet has a different combination of values for jumping to it, scanning it and landing on it.&#10;&#10;Each player has a hand of five cards, with each card having three color-coded values on it: blue for jumping, green for scanning, and orange for landing. On a turn, you take two actions from six possibilities, with the same action being possible:&#10;&#10;&mdash;Top up: Discard any number of cards (including zero), then refill your hand to five cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Jump: Move your spaceship from the jump gate (where players start the game) or a planet to any other planet by discarding a card that shows the landing value of the target planet. Place one of your tokens on the jump gate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Fly: Move your spaceship to either neighboring planet; this move is free.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Scan: Discard a card with the scanning value of the planet where your spaceship is currently located; look through the face-down planet tiles, place one aside face-down with your marker on it, then return the tiles to that planet. This action is possible only on undeveloped planets.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Develop: Develop the planet where your spaceship is located by discarding two cards that match the two landing values shown on that planet. Mark this planet with your space station token, hand out all scanned and claimed planet tiles to the appropriate players, claim one remaining planet tile for yourself, then place the remaining tiles face-down again. A planet can be developed only once.&#10;&#10;&mdash;Discover: Take a planet tile of your choice from the developed planet where your spaceship is currently located.&#10;&#10;If at any point, all of the planet tiles on a planet show only empty space, the player holding the tiles lays them face-up next to that planet. When 6-12 space tiles have been revealed, an amount based on the number of players, the game ends and players tally their points.&#10;&#10;Each type of planet tile scores in a different way. With Minerals, for example, you multiply the number of mineral tiles you hold with the largest number of mineral tiles in a single color. Medals are worth three points each. A green-blue pair of Matter tiles is worth seven points, while a single Matter tile is worth only two. Each space station you've built is worth three points, and the players score 9, 6, 3 and 1 for having the most, secondmost, etc. tokens on the jump gate.

The Swedish army fits the mold of both the Prussians and Russians but falls into line just below them in overall strength.&#10;&#10;Indians: The Kingdoms of the Marathas, Mughals, Mysore and Sikhs from the Punjab have banded together to overthrow the colonial powers of the day. Their problem is overcoming the lack of a true leader that makes it difficult to set aside their rivalries and squabbling.

They are a true guerilla force adept at denying their opponents resources or freedom to maneuver.&#10;&#10;Tokugawa Shogunate: The Shogunate is crumbling. The army seeks to modernize against the will of the Shogun and in a few years Japan will step into the Industrial age. However, at the turn of the 19th Century, insular clans still dominated the military. Every Daimyo leads his own army into battle with their own guns, cavalry, samurai and teppo. Only the Shogun can be called on to make any Clan work with another.

On a turn, a player plays one or more tiles to the game board (possibly using tiles already in play) to create a valid equation, with the operators being resolved left to right or top to bottom, except for division which always takes place first. A Multichoice or Freesymbol tile can be used as a new operator or number if a player adds tiles to an existing equation. If a player places tiles adjacent to tiles already on the board, he does not have to create a valid equation (unlike Scrabble in which each multiletter combination must be a valid word). The sum or product of a player's equation is that player's score for the round; if any part of the equation's answer covers a &quot;D&quot; on the game board, that player's score for the round is doubled. The player then refills his hand to eight tiles.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing tiles, a player can swap any number of tiles from his hand for new tiles or simply pass.&#10;&#10;When one player has no tiles and the bag is empty &ndash; or when all players pass in succession &ndash; the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

The game is intended to be played by a very small number of players or solitaire. In principle it could work with up to 6, but it is recommended for 2 or 3 players.&#10;&#10;During a single game year, rikishi first train, which means that they improve their skills in 1 or 2 of 5 different areas of skill (endurance, strength, weight (yes, that's a skill here...), speed, technique). In the meanwhile their oyakata (stable masters, comp. coaches) try to improve their spirits, which works like a 6th skill.&#10;&#10;After training the basho (tournament) begins. A whole year of sumo (6 basho) is condensed into a single tournament (of 45 bouts) in the game. Every bout is decided by the match tactic and a number of dice. Rikishi can try to influence the match tactic such that it matches their strongest skills (or the opponent's weaknesses).&#10;&#10;After the basho the banzuke (ranking) is adjusted, rikishi age one year, and some retire (forcibly or voluntarily).&#10;&#10;Playing one game year takes about 45 to 60 minutes, most of which is taken up by the tournament. Consequently, simulating a 10-year sumo career will take up to 10 hours.

If a player has a SEARCH CARD, he may play it face down in the discard tray and then &quot;search&quot; for one of his coins (designated on his Coin Selection Cards).  He does this by touching one of the &quot;money bags&quot; and declaring, for example &quot;the Turkish kurus is in this bag.&quot; He then lifts the &quot;bag&quot; and if the Turkish kurus IS underneath the &quot;bag&quot;, he removes the coin and places it in front of him as part of his score.  He then replaces the &quot;money bag&quot;.  As the game progresses, ocoins and empty areas will be exposed and it will become increasingly important to remember their locations.  If a player exposes one of his opponent's coin, he merely replaces the bag and it is the opponent's turn.  If the opponent has a SEARCH CARD, he is in the happy position of eing able to acquire a coin immediately.  Players draw and play cards alternately.&#10;7. If a player has a $5,000 or $2,000 COIN CARD he may hold it for future play, he may play it face up in front of him counting toward his score, or he may discard it.&#10;8. If a player has a WINDFALL CARD he may lift ANY bag and remove the coin - IF it is one of HIS coins.&#10;9. If a player has an ILLEGAL COIN CARD, he may play it on his opponent's score pile. The opponent then may not play ANY card except a LEGAL COIN CARD or a SEARCH CARD on his next turn. In the meantime he must discard one card into the discard tray after every draw. If he plays a SEARCH CARD, this permits him to search for a coin. If he plays a LEGAL COIN CARD, he takes no further action until his next turn.&#10;10. If the &quot;Draw&quot; tray is emptied before the game ends, reshuffle those in the &quot;discard&quot; tray and continue play.&#10;&#10;WHO WINS:&#10;The first player to accumulate $100,000 or more in coins and cards. Actual coins from COIN CARDS count $20,000 each.  The COIN CARDS count $2,000 or $5,000 according to their face value.&#10;&#10;"
