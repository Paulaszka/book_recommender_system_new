Often, they were not able to repay him in cash, so they awarded him special privileges, such as trade rights and offices.&#10;&#10;2 to 5 players ages 12 and up assume the role of the merchants from Augsburg and try to get what they can -- by means of auctions -- from the nobility, thus increasing their wealth and particularly their social status.&#10;&#10;The game play uses a simple bidding mechanism. Each round, players offer cards of varying values in a series of five auctions. Once a bid is made, players either raise the bid, call, or drop. The winning player may choose from a set of possible actions that increase abilities (and more importantly, points).  After a number of rounds (dependent on the number of players), scores are tallied. It's that simple.&#10;&#10;This is a game by Karsten Hartwig, whose other game &ldquo;Chinatown&rdquo; was already published by Alea. Game length varies -- depending on the number of players -- between 25 to 90 minutes. The difficulty level is a 4 on the Alea 1-10 scale (the same as Ra).&#10;&#10;Besides the players&rsquo; tableaus and a game board, there are 90 game cards and various game chits.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea medium box series.&#10;&#10;"

If the Goat is dealt to the table, he must be put back in the pack shuffled, and a new card dealt to the table in its place.&#10;&#10;The first player must make a pair by matching a card on the table with one in his hand if he can, at the same time reading aloud the title of the card, for instance, &quot;I am Buster's Father&quot;.

Then, if a player cannot make a pair by matching one on the table, he may make one from his hand. If he can do neither, he must draw a card from his left-hand neighbor and try to make a pair from the table or from his hand, and so on, until the last card remains unplayed which must be the Goat. The player with that card must hold it up and say &quot;I am the Goat.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Determined by numbers of players, a given number of &quot;8&quot; cards are revealed from each players deck, and everybody tries to match the two face up cards from the common decks with their tableau. If they find the &quot;0&quot; matching to one of their &quot;8&quot;, they put it below their card. A matching &quot;15&quot; they put on top of their &quot;8&quot;.

Players also have a small hand of five cards that provide certain benefits when played.  Unlike the other two games, Checkered Flag simulates stock car racing.&#10;&#10;Given that speeds are more constant in stock car racing, there are only three speed choices; 60, 120 and 180 miles per hour.  At the beginning of the race and after a pit stop, cars start off at 60.  In the two turns, the maximum speed is 120.  The turns drive the primary choices available, as some lanes provide a shorter path than others.  The choice lanes have a cost in fuel usage or tire wear.

I am not sure if this game has been renamed?&#10;&#10;Sure Shot Baseball is a two person game played much the same way as outdoor baseball.  The game consists of nine innings of 3 outs each.  The &quot;pitcher&quot; rolls a plastic marble down a slide and it heads toward a batter controlled by their opponent.  The &quot;batter&quot; tries to hit the ball out of the stadium by turning a batting knob.  If it goes out of the unique up-curved field the &quot;fielder&quot; then tries to catch it.  Singles, doubles, triples, foul balls, and home runs are determined where the ball goes over the wall.  The &quot;runners&quot; stay in their team dugouts until it is time to position them on the field.&#10;&#10;Each &quot;batter&quot; gets only one pitch. A missed pitch counts as one out.  Each team gets three outs and then players change positions.  Players play nine innings and whomever has the most runs wins.&#10;&#10;There are a few other simple rules.  The game is quite tricky to learn and play competitively.  But it is definitely a fun experience if you enjoy baseball!!&#10;&#10;"
