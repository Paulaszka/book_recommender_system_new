On one hand, the players work together to bust out of the famous prison; on the other hand they all know that one of them will be left behind as the scapegoat.&#10;&#10;Alcatraz is a peculiar game because while it is cooperative in some aspects, with players needing to work together to complete tasks, the game has loads of negative interaction as one player will always be the scapegoat. You don't want to be that guy. You don't &quot;go all in,&quot; you don't always keep your promises, and you don't do &quot;what's best for the group.&quot; Instead, you do everything you can to become indispensable, and &quot;everything&quot; is literal here &ndash; even if it means stealing from, betraying, and blackmailing other players.&#10;&#10;In order to escape from Alcatraz, the players need to complete six parts of a plan. Each part is a &quot;pick-up and deliver&quot; task requiring specific items obtained in different parts of the prison. Once each part of the plan is completed, every player but the scapegoat moves a little closer to escaping, with the scapegoat being voted on each round by all the players &ndash; most likely the player who contributed the least to completing that particular task, but you never know. Thus, you could say that Alcatraz is a cooperative game &ndash; but with a twist.&#10;&#10;The map of the prison constituting the play area is generated randomly each game, providing high replayability. Alcatraz is designed for 3-4 players, and due to its theme and complex gameplay is best suited for mature players.&#10;&#10;"

Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the town of Deadwood consists of the Town Hall, the Church, the Sheriff's Office, the Saloon, and four other randomly drawn buildings. Additional buildings are constructed whenever a cowboy annexes the Town Hall. Each building has at least one unique ability that is used immediately, with some buildings offering more long-term advantages.&#10;&#10;A cowboy accesses these advantages by controlling the building. To gain control a player simply places one of his gang on a building tile, &quot;annexing&quot; it. Other gang leaders can try to gain control of your buildings through shootouts. The player that instigates the shootout receives a Wanted Poster token; the more cowboys you try to kill off, the more Wanted Poster tokens you collect, and the higher the fine you must pay at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Deadwood can end one of three ways: the Train Station is placed on the board once the railroad is built and completed, there are no more Wanted Poster tokens in the Crime Pool, or any player has no more cowboys alive.

Each player must decide how to best allocate their play time between moving the cube or searching and calling out each word with its point value. Typically, a game consists of 2 to 5 rounds of play.  Players compete for the highest score by adding up the letter values for all words appearing anywhere around the cube.  The letters can wrap around the sides of the cube from one face to another and must links diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.

Vanguard).&#10;&#10;In the game, players &quot;ride&quot; a unit as their Vanguard, which represents them on the board. They may also summon other units as Rear Guards to attack or support. The game is won by doing 6 points of damage to the opponent's Vanguard.&#10;&#10;As players attack, if they are using their vanguard they can &quot;drive check&quot; whereby they check the top card of their deck for &quot;triggers&quot; which increase power and have other effects, and add these cards to their hand. Triggers can also be revealed when players take damage to their vanguard by performing a &quot;damage check&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player places their grade 0 starting vanguard face down in the &quot;vanguard circle&quot; and then draws 5 cards. They may return any number of cards to the deck and re-draw to form their starting hand, but only once. It's a good tactic to return trigger cards from your first hand as these are better utilised when drawn from the deck as part of a &quot;drive check&quot; or &quot;damage check&quot;.&#10;&#10;Once the players are done setting up their initial hand they determine who goes first (often, rock-paper-scissors is used for this) and then each turn follows the same turn order:&#10;&#10;1. Stand up (only at the start of the game, and both players perform this action simultaneously whereby they flip over their vanguard)&#10;2. Stand and Draw&#10;3. Ride&#10;4. Call&#10;5. Attack&#10;6. Guard&#10;7. Drive Check&#10;8. Damage Check&#10;9. (more attacks? Go back to 5)&#10;10. Turn end - change to other player and go back to 2&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that strategically, taking damage early in the game can be beneficial as you can use cards in the damage zone to &quot;counter blast&quot; (flip the cards over to activate special actions on certain units).&#10;&#10;"

Each player draws 6 cards&#10;2. Roll the dice: If someone owns a card with matching symbols he/she may start putting this side up in the middle of the table. If no one has a matching card all the players must draw an additional one and roll the dice again.&#10;3. Now proceed adding your cards by turn according 'Dominoes', but you must roll the dice first or you choose the dice result of your predecessor: Only the those numbers can be placed with matching numbers to cards on the table AND on the dice; a Joker may be placed at any combination. During your turn you may add further cards, which have to match with cards on the table only.&#10;4. If you have finished your turn draw a new card from the pile&#10;5.

These rules are intended for use with 28-30mm miniatures but could easily be adapted to smaller scales. Individual models are assigned individual skill levels (Streetwise, Brawling, Ranged Combat) and are given an allotment of Option Points to further customize each figure. Players equip each of their forces based on an Equipment Points system which allows them to add weapons, ammo, and miscellaneous equipment. Combat rules cover close combat, ranged, and special weapons such as RPGs and other heavy arms.&#10;&#10;From the introduction:&#10;'Street F.M.' is designed to represent small-scale conflict in a modern or near future urban environment. By employing scale models to represent the combatants and their surroundings it is possible to create clashes between street gangs, criminals, law enforcers and small military units. In fact any group entering urban combat, armed with everything from improvised weapons through to rocket launchers can be covered by the system.&#10;&#10;"
