Players move their pawn from the start space to the North Pole and back again.&#10;&#10;Players choose from one of 6 pre-defined expeditions or use a random method to generate their own expedition.  Each expedition has 9 stats: Men, Dogs, Food, Gear, Skill, Will, Ship, Time, and Hoax. These stats represent the composition, skills, supplies, start point, start time and legitimacy of the expedition &ndash; these may change during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;The board is a track 30 spaces long including a start space at one end and the North Pole space at the other end.

Event Phase&#10;-   Roll once on the event table. Except for the blizzard result, all other results will require the player to make a test against either Gear, Will, or Skill. A test is resolved by rolling 1D10. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the value of the stat, you pass the test. If it is less, you fail the test which will usually result in a permanent loss of a stat or a penalty to your move total in the travel phase.&#10;&#10;2.  Travel Phase&#10;-   Draw 5 travel cards. You may discard up to 2 cards and draw replacements. &#10;Add up the move values of all 5 cards.  This is your move total - move that many spaces forward. You must stop upon reaching the North Pole. &#10;-   If you land on an opponent&rsquo;s pawn that is not on its starting space, move it back 1 space. &#10;-   If you have 2 or more dog cards move an extra +1. &#10;-   If you have 4 or more trek cards move an extra +1.&#10;&#10;3.  End Phase&#10;-   Consume 1 food point. &#10;-   If there is no food left then -1 dog. &#10;-   If there is no food or dogs roll on the casualty table and resolve.

Throughout the game, players will collectively play cards into and take cards from a set of seven central canon cards.  Players also play into and take cards from their own personal set of seven canon cards. On a turn, players can draw a card or play a card.  Cards can be drawn from the central canon, personal canon, draw stack, or discard pile.  Cards can be played into the central canon, personal canon, or discard pile.  Matching cards can be placed on top of each other in subsequent turns, which can make it more difficult to remove a card from the central canon or make that stack of cards in your personal canon worth many more points.

The name comes from the playing pieces, which are 'skewed cubes'. Skjuubs are 'directional', meaning that their orientation is relevant to gameplay.&#10;Skjuub is in a sense a 'logical successor' to the Series: Tixel of games (Tix, Tixel and Regatta). The form factor is different but the 'gameplay structure' is very similar.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Skjuub is played on a 6x6 square grid. Each player has her own pool of 11 pieces, differentiated by color.&#10;&#10;A PLAYER'S TURN&#10;On a turn, a player can either place a new skjuub or move one of her own skjuubs already on the board. The orientation of a skjuub (which side the 'overhang' is facing) is decided upon when placing it on the board. A skjuub can be active or inactive and only active skjuubs may be moved.&#10;A skjuub is inactive if at least one of its sides is fully connected to a similarly shaped side of another piece (regardless of color).&#10;&#10;NORMAL MOVES; Placement&#10;When placing a new skjuub on the board you are not allowed make one or more opponent skjuubs inactive. A new skjuub may be placed next to one or more already inactive skjuubs in a way in which it becomes inactive itself as well. Such placement does not result in the player getting a bonus move (see section 'BONUS MOVES').&#10;&#10;NORMAL MOVES; Sliding and tumbling&#10;A move can be either a slide (in which the orientation of the skjuub remains the same) or a tumble (in which in which the orientation of the skjuub does change - the overhang 'switches' to the opposite side).&#10;In a single move a skjuub may be slid as many squares as wanted (horizontally or vertically along its row or column) but may be tumbled only once (to an adjacent square from where it started the tumble, either in the direction of the overhang or in the opposite direction).&#10;When placing, sliding or tumbling, other skjuubs that are on the board may not be 'disturbed'; their locations and orientations must remain the same.&#10;&#10;BONUS MOVES&#10;Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks additional move types (besides placing, sliding and tumbling). If a skjuub that is slid or tumbled is made inactive at its end position - i.e., it's sacrificed - the player gets a bonus move. As a bonus move she can do one of the following:&#10;&#10;        - one of the normal moves; place, slide or tumble one of her other skjuubs. These slides and tumbles (but not placements) can themselves result in additional bonus moves.&#10;        - pick up one of her other skjuubs from the board (not the one skjuub that was just sacrificed!) and place it back in her pool of available skjuubs.&#10;        - turn one of her active skjuubs a quarter turn clockwise or anticlockwise. The skjuub that is turned must also still be active after the turn (it may not be sacrificed by the turn).&#10;        - pass the bonus move.&#10;&#10;&#10;When turning a skjuub, other skjuubs that are on the board may not be 'disturbed'. When picking up a skjuub, other skjuubs may temporarily be moved aside to make picking up the skjuub easier but they must be returned to their original locations and orientations afterwards.&#10;One or more other skjuubs can also become inactive by a skjuub being sacrificed. Skjuubs may also be sacrificed adjacent to other skjuubs that are already inactive though (regardless of color).&#10;&#10;NO BACKTRACKING&#10;Players are not allowed to undo their previous turn by playing it 'in reverse'. If the previous turn had one or more bonus moves, only the very last bonus move may not be played in reverse.&#10;The main point of the rule is to prevent players from tumbling or sliding one and the same skjuub back and forth in consecutive turns. Therefor it is allowed to pick up a skjuub that was placed in the previous turn. Players are also allowed to alternate between sliding and tumbling the same skjuub repeatedly.&#10;There is one exception to the rule: Backtracking is allowed if it captures an opponent piece (and the piece that does the backtracking becomes inactive itself too).&#10;&#10;ENDING THE GAME&#10;A player loses the game if, at the beginning of her turn, she does not have at least one active skjuub on the board that is both able and allowed to slide and/or tumble.&#10;&#10;"

Bewildered but resolute, she set out to revisit all the planets in reverse order in the hope of retrieving all her lost memories.&#10;&#10;Deja Vu: Fragments of Memory is about memory, but it is NOT a memory game; instead the game focuses on tableau-building and set-collecting, and to win the game, you must perform well both tactically and strategically. In the tactical part, players collect wooden tokens on the map with various combinations of color and shape, and both the color and shape are essential to success! The process of collecting is a pleasantly perplexing mind puzzle.&#10;&#10;In the strategic part, players use the wooden tokens they gained to add cards to their tableau, building up their &quot;card engine&quot;, which serves to generate victory points, reinforce their resource-collecting ability, and improve the engine itself. Should you increase your selection of cards first? Or create more space to save up resources? Maybe you should plant more cosmic flowers? Balanced and efficient long-term planning is the key to victory.&#10;&#10;The central cosmic map, aside from being a place to hold resources, is also a battlefield to contest precious memory fragments which, when paired with the right cards, can earn enormous amount of ictory points for you!&#10;&#10;"

In the drawing rounds, the players try to draw as many of their words as possible, whereas in the guessing rounds they try to correctly guess other player drawings and want their own ones to be guessed.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays at the same time, therefore the gameplay is very active and you have to be quick and attentive.

A fully cooperative, campaign-driven, miniatures board game, Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay tells the story of 5 heroes from the Wanderer's Guild, and their struggle to free the small fishing town of Barnacle Bay from the slimy claws of Elder Bane. Driven mad by power, and physically twisted from dark magic, Elder Bane has created a cult of mutated townsfolk that only desire to spread their message of madness to the rest of the world, bending it to their whim along the way.&#10;&#10;In Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay, players will select one of five unique heroes, outfit their hero with starting gear (represented by mini cards on a player dashboard), and join their friends to take back Barnacle Bay. Defeating foes and surviving random encounters earns players experience points and loot. Loot, like weapons and armor, is a persistent upgrade, staying with the heroes as they continue on their adventure. Experience points are used to level up heroes during their current adventure in the campaign. A dual-facing upgrade tree allows players to continually try new combinations of skills each adventure to determine what fits their play style, or current set of foes, best.&#10;&#10;Using a modular board, players assemble maps as indicated in the campaign book, then use action points to move or attack with their hero.&#10;&#10;All enemies in the game are controlled by a simple line of sight A.I., and automatically hit the players' heroes once they're able to. This means there is no player rolling for success for enemies' attacks. Heroes will, however, be able to roll for defense in an effort to prevent incoming wounds. One set of custom dice determines a hero's success for both defending and attacking. Random encounter cards, which are revealed when players enter an  unexplored &quot;darkness&quot; space, also promise that no campaign adventure is ever be the same.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
