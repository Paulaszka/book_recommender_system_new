Play is much like Rummy, but the emphasis is on sequences.  In fact, the player with the longest sequence at the end of the hand is the only player to score.  Melds of three and four of a kind are useful, however; they are immediately replaced by a like number of cards from either the stock or the discard pile.&#10;&#10;"

Points available to Player 1 are interspersed with points available to Player 2 in a checkerboard pattern.  When you form a loop which surrounds enemy stones, you remove the enemy stones from the board.  Neither player may place stones into a loop.  A player owns the perimeter of his loop as well as all of the points contained within the loop.  When all of the board points, both occupied and unoccupied are owned by the players, the game is concluded and the player who owns the majority of points wins.&#10;&#10;Rule sheet:&#10;    http://www.marksteeregames.com/Palisade_rules.pdf&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Super Duper Games&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Players begin with four &quot;colour cards&quot; representing a different facet of life at Eton - artistic, sporting, social and academic. They must then work their way round a stylised map of the college, getting rid of all their cards to become the winner.  A variety of penalties can be imposed for bad behavior, including a &quot;faux pas&quot; for things such as hitting a teacher with a snowball, or allowing one's mother to turn up at school in an embarrassing hat.&#10;&#10;The game was invented by an Eton housemaster and his assistant, both old boys of the school themselves.&#10;&#10;"

Many of those who play miniatures began with this book and almost all existing rules systems can trace their lineage back to this book.&#10;&#10;The book is a detailed building up of rules for playing a war game.  It contains detailed discussion of the rationale behind these rules, grounding them in military theory and history.  The book contains two sets of rules:  an elementary set for playing simple games and an advanced set of rules to provide a richer simulation.  It also contains one scenario, a mythical 18th century battle, which is played out step by step in the book.&#10;&#10;These rules define the &quot;Old School&quot; of war gaming: individually based figures in large units with written orders to sub-commanders, etc.  Despite its age, there are groups of gamers who continue to base their encounters on the spirit of this book if not its strict letter.&#10;&#10;"

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.&#10;&#10;"
