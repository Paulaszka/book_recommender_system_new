To win, you have to move two of your pieces onto the other side.  Your pieces are all the same shape, in red, yellow, and green.  You roll a die, and then get to move one of your pieces that number.&#10;&#10;The gimmick is this: before moving your piece, you choose which one you want to move, and then turn a hidden dial to that color.  Your opponent then turns their hidden dial to the color they THINK you're going to choose (or the color they want to stop you from choosing).&#10;&#10;After both players have set their dials, a button is pressed, and the colors light up, revealing the choices.  If he guessed right, you don't get to move.  Otherwise you do move, and then the turn alternates - your opponent rolls and you have to guess.&#10;&#10;There are passages on the board that can be blocked strategically, and you can't pass another token - but if you land on it exactly, you send it back home&#10;&#10;There's a lot of double- and triple- thinking (&quot;They think I'm going to do that, but instead I'll do this.
