The four players (rules are also provided for two or three) represent the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), South Vietnamese Army (ARVN), Viet Cong (VC), and the US Armed Forces. There are also civilian units. The map shows North and South Vietnam plus adjacent areas on a square grid.&#10;&#10;The system has more of the flavor of an abstract strategy game than a typical wargame. Units have low movement allowances (1 or 2), although regular armed forces can move greater distances by road or rail. Combat is deterministic.&#10;&#10;Some of the VC player's units start mixed in with the civilian units, only he or she knowing which ones they are. To fight, they must be revealed. The US and ARVN players can attack civilians if they think they are VC, but if they are wrong the VC player gets to add more concealed VC to the game. If the VC/civilian ratio becomes too skewed the ARVN player is out of the game.&#10;&#10;The goal for the NVA and VC players is to occupy a certain value of cities on South Vietnam. The US and ARVN players win by either occupying enough cities in North Vietnam and reducing the VC level, or by eliminating all overt VC units and clearing South Vietnam of NVA units.&#10;&#10;There are some additional game elements, such as a deck of event cards which can be drawn in lieu of one's turn (or if an incursion of Laos occurs), reinforcements, and the possibility of Chinese Army forces entering.&#10;&#10;The game is packaged in a red folder which pretends to be a CIA briefing folder. In addition to the game rules, the booklet inside the folder contains &quot;briefing&quot; materials - a time line of the Vietnam conflict, analysis of the phases of insurgency, and a (somewhat satirical) glossary.

Scenarios include ACW, F&amp;IW, Wild West, Indian Mutiny and Napoleonics.&#10;&#10;Extract from the Design Philosophy section of the rules:&#10;&#10;These rules have been written with the aim of providing a fast moving game, lasting one or two hours, that uses uncomplicated mechanisms that are easily learned and remembered.  With this in mind we have adopted a number of basic standards throughout.  All die rolls are made on a single d6 (with high numbers indicating a favorable result), modifiers are kept to a minimum, and realism is achieved using scenarios rather than &quot;point value&quot; forces.  It is our belief that the man is more important than the weapon he uses, consequently you will not find endless tables of technical data on various rifles etc., only generic weapon types.  It is the way the weapon is used, and the quality of the soldiery using it, that affects the outcome of the situation.&#10;&#10;"

TM is a new concept in board games. It involves the player using their sense of smell to move around the board. The theme of the game is a race to the finish around through the village of Odorville. Players evade traps set by with a lively the naughty skunk StinkySmellsTM who makes the players smell different smells as they move around the board.&#10;&#10;Odorville is made up of different venues where people today encounter smell. Rigorous market testing among kids and parents help identify the venues. The game starts out at a farm and then proceeds to the beach, garbage dump, laundry, candle shops, restaurants, outdoors, garages and ends at the carnival. The board is littered with over 300 elements of smell. Another innovative idea on the board is a changing path which changes according to the landscape the player is currently on. In the farm the player is on a dirt track which changes to grass in the maze, sand on the beach till it ends in cobble stones at the carnival. The best part of the game is not the board or the lovable characters but the scratch and sniff smell cards.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 45 cards &ndash; 30 of them with smell and 15 cards that have no smell but require the player to identify things that smell on the board. The smell cards are broken in to 3 categories &ndash; good, bad and mystery. The game comes with smells like skunk, manure, peppermint, BBQ sauce, popcorn etc. Additional refill packs can be purchased with different smells or different themes.&#10;&#10;"

It is not just a supplement, though, but a complete rule system in its own right. As the title suggests, it enables the players to expand their hunting activities into the Age of Mammals, and to take on a wide range of quarry - living, extinct or simply mysterious - from prehistoric saber-tooths to modern African big game.&#10;&#10;Each player may choose to control either a human hunter character, or an animal. The hunters move, shoot etc. in a fairly conventional &quot;skirmish wargame&quot;  sort of way, by means of dice, while for the animal players we have introduced a card driven system, using an ordinary pack of playing cards. The intention is to bring out the difference between human intelligence - as represented, however unlikely it may sound, by the wargamer - and that of the quarry, who should combine a limited range of tactical options with an element of unpredictability. To compensate for this, the animals will usually be able to move faster than the hunters, and will have a decisive advantage if they manage to get to close range.&quot;&#10;&#10;"
