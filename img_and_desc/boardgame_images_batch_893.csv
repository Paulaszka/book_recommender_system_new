During the game, each player tries to get past the network of walls which his opponent is building against him. As he removes walls that are blocking him, he repositions them where he feels they will most hinder his opponent. Each tries to reach the center red dot (which is the only way off the board).&#10;&#10;With both players heading for the center red exit dot they will often find themselves facing each other with no walls between them. These head to head encounters create exciting situations in which one or more pieces can be sent back to their respective &quot;jail&quot; corners to start over again.&#10;&#10;The game is quite simple and lots of fun. The advantage can swing from one player to the other and back again many times throughout the entire game.&#10;&#10;MAZE is [a wooden product] produced on home-made machines, silk-screened and assembled by hand.

The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the three, two-man crew S.L.C. (Siluro a Lenta Corsa) Maiale (Pig) class and CA 2 mini-submarines. You must endeavor to overcome the US defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or escaping.&#10;&#10;An Italian raid with by their frogmen was seriously planned and approved by both the Regia Marina and the Decima Mas. The planned raid was to have taken place in December 1943, but for game purposes I&rsquo;ve moved it up to the summer of that year, before fascist Italy&rsquo;s invasion and surrender.&#10;&#10;A raid on the US was desirable for a number of reasons by the Italian naval high command. Potential targets in the Mediterranean were, by late 1942, well aware and experienced with the Italian raiders, and Allied defensive measures were increasingly deadly. The early 1942 German Operation Drumbeat U-Boat offensive, dubbed the &ldquo;Happy Time&rdquo;, exposed serious weaknesses and deficiencies in the US coastal and harbor defenses. A successful strike at the most prominent harbor in the US would be a tremendous psychological as well as military victory for the Axis cause. However, when it was proposed to their German allies in late 1941, Admiral Doenitz declined to support the operation with any U-Boats, but did approve sending any and all intelligence they came across to support Italian raid.&#10;&#10;Unlike the frogmen raids conducted at Gibraltar, Alexandria, Algeciras and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the raid on New York would also include the newest mini-submarine in the Italian navy&rsquo;s arsenal, the CA 2. Armed with two torpedoes, these small submarines were so top secret they were never entered into the Regia Marina&rsquo;s Order of Battle. Similar CA 5 type mini-submarines had raised havoc in the Black Sea and Adriatic, sinking numerous vessels and supporting blockades of enemy held ports. The CA 2 mini-sub and its crew, as well as the frogmen&rsquo;s Maiale submersibles, would have to be ferried to the target area by a much larger submarine. The only one capable of doing so in the Italian navy was the fleet submarine Leonardo da Vinci. Modifications to its hull to transport the CA 2 were made in German occupied Bordeaux, and training of its crew and the raiders done in ultra-high secrecy in the Bay of Biscay. However, in May the Leonardo da Vinci was surprised and sunk by the British destroyer HMS Active and frigate HMS Ness with all hands. By that time Sicily was invaded and the Mussolini government soon over-thrown. The chaos that Italy descended to, and the new government&rsquo;s later decision to cast their lot with the Allies, rendered the raid on New York to the dust bin of history.&#10;&#10;Could the Italian navy pull off what no other nation had achieved since the War of 1812? I hope all who play Depths of Courage volume 10 learn and enjoy!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The cave is laid out in a 5x5 grid and has build cards (systems such as gears) laid out in it.  The build cards come in 4 system types, four connection types, and have systems on either side.  There are four types of schematics for things to build: Doohickeys, Whatsits, Thingamajigs, and Combobulations.  Use teams of gnomes to shove, flip, replan, and swap build cards to create systems that will meet the requirements of the schematics.  Earn victory points and build your support to get more gnomes to help you in future turns.  Keep building until one schematic deck runs out and the then the highest point total at the end of the round is the winner.&#10;&#10;For a co-operative challenge, play the Gremlin Invasion variant.  The gremlins are invading the Caves of Neverwhere and getting in the way of your building plans.  Every turn, a new gremlin is added to the caves and the ones already there stir up more mischief.  Contend with over a dozen different gremlins like Masher Trasher, Fiendish Fil, Jammin' Sammy, and Head Dread.  All with unique and mischievous powers.  If you don't do anything about them they will overrun the caves.  Recruit gremlin hunters to chase the gremlins out of the cave, but be careful, chasing gremlins eats up valuable time and resources.&#10;&#10;Plays essentially the same as the competitive game, but the goal is for the team to get to 100 points before time runs out.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players take the roles of 'thrashers' who raid outposts throughout the planet of GRAXX in the hopes of coming across rare items, resources, weapons and engage enemies in a non-stop massacre.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in a single session, however, thrashers can continue their exploits in an ongoing career; the game only truly ends when your thrasher perishes. After a successful raid, thrashers gain experience, which is used to purchase new weapons, items and add skills, making them more powerful as they head into raid after raid after raid. Upon the final encounter of their raid, thrashers will face bosses, who will attempt to thwart their efforts to escape. Future expansions (coming soon) will add new encounters, new outposts, new enemies, new traps, bosses and so much more, making the game something players will want to come back to, time and time again.&#10;&#10;We welcome you to the Mutant Outpost Massacre. May you live, die and thrash.&#10;&#10;Goremageddon is heavily inspired by over-the-top violence, exploitation, gore, horror, humor and post apocalyptic films on the 1980s, as well as RetroWave and Thrash Metal music.

Every manufacturing concern was now faced with the daunting tasks of converting production facilities to wartime goods at levels never before seen during peacetime. The focus on the US steel industry was of particular concern, as nearly all weapons and wartime support derived from their factories and workers. However, nearly all of the leaders and owners of the US steel industry were either very dismissive or even obstructionist of the prospects the US would become involved in the war, and President Roosevelt&rsquo;s attempts to ready the country for war.&#10;&#10;Nearly all of the iron ore, as well as much of the limestone, needed for the steel industries were shipped over the Great Lakes from the iron ore fields in Minnesota to the ports at Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, Buffalo in the US and Hamilton, Ontario in Canada. From those ports the iron ore was shipped by rail to the steel mill complexes in Gary, Detroit, Cleveland, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Hamilton. The massive ore carriers that plied the waters of the Great Lakes sailed from mid-April to late November when weather and water conditions permitted. However, it soon became apparent that the amount of iron ore laid up in late November 1941 for use during the winter and spring was totally inadequate for the war effort. The US &ldquo;arsenal of democracy&rdquo; would be essentially shooting blanks due to shortages of steel and idle plants if the shortfalls of iron ore and limestone were not quickly addressed. In a bold decision it was decided to mobilize at least part of the Great Lakes ore carrier fleet to allow it to begin loading and delivering the badly needed iron and limestone ores a month ahead of the regular start of the sailing season. Besides the severe challenges of the late winter weather, with severe storms, ice bergs and jams and frigid waters, finding officers, crew, and dock workers to work at the loading and unloading ports would be difficult as wartime drafts and the demands for materials and men from other wartime challenges were encountered. Historically, the &ldquo;Winter Fleet&rdquo; led to 1942 setting all-time new records in the delivery of ore via the Great Lakes, as well as production of steel. But the risks and costs were high.&#10;&#10;Breaking the Ice is a solitaire play game on the Great Lakes &ldquo;Winter Fleet&rdquo;. The player will have to allocate valuable resources and deploy the car ferry ice breakers to support the ore fleet in the mission of delivering the most ore to the production ports as possible, with a minimal amount of damage to the fleet as possible.

Because this task is more difficult, if they succeed they can score any body they wish.&#10;&#10;The first team to score all nine different body parts wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"
