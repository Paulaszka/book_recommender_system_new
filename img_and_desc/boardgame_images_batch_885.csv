He gains access to more dice and more colors as he levels-up. Players choose and roll dice from their pool, then take actions as allowed by those rolls.

Removal of a sleep chamber from the board requires 2 steps. When a robot lands on a space where there is a sleep chamber, the chamber will either be lying down (untouched) or standing up (unlocked). &#10;If the sleep chamber is untouched when the robot arrives, it will be pushed out of the space containing the robot and stood up (unlocked).

Players look to remove chambers from the board that match the numbers of one of 3 available escape pods in the launch bay. If a match is made, the player takes the cards and the sleep chamber to their safe zone and earns 2 points.  If the number of the sleep chamber does not match an available escape pod, but they have an available second space in a pod they have already launched they may place the sleep chamber in this space to earn 1 point.&#10;&#10;One of 3 events will cause the game to end.

Movement is achieved by pivoting these triangles around their edges, allowing them to overlay and temporarily immobilize opponents' pieces. The objective is to strategically navigate and control the board, aiming to reach specific target zones. While the game offers a rich tactical experience, it's important to note that its reliance on color differentiation may present challenges for colorblind players.&#10;&#10;"

These nine worlds are represented on a three-level, 3D game board, with the board having locations for artifact cards, creature cards, hero pawns, elf pawns, anonymous pawns, and more. Each level of the board depicts three worlds on it, and the middle board rotates.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player places the top card of their enemy deck on the &quot;Wheel of Enemies&quot;. Players can take turns in any order. On a player's turn, they first reveal their enemy card. If this is the first appearance of this enemy this round, the player continues their turn; if not, then the enemy is activated, typically moving to a different world, then taking some action. If the enemy can't move, e.g., Surt is supposed to move up a level, but is already on the top level, you lose the game. If the enemy can't take its action, e.g., Loki needs to place an Iotunn pawn, but none remain in Iotunheim, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;While normally you hope to avoid duplicating an enemy, you want to double up on Nidho&#204;&#136;gg as that enemy starts on the leftmost space in your saga book, and if Nidho&#204;&#136;gg moves all the way to the tree icon, you win the game. (Nidho&#204;&#136;gg might also trigger effects when moving to a new location.)&#10;&#10;If an enemy moves to where another enemy is located, that world is devastated and no action is possible there except for healing the world tree.&#10;&#10;Whether or not an enemy is activated, you can then move &mdash; either to a different world on the same level or a different level above or below your current location &mdash; then act, either performing the action of the world in which you're now located or fighting. Powerful god that you are, you always win a fight, but you suffer &quot;risks&quot; equal to the strength of the enemy. You can sacrifice heroes in Valhalla to remove risks or make saving throws on dice, possibly with an elf assist, but each risk you don't prevent costs you 1 life point &mdash; and if any god runs out of life points, you lose the game.&#10;&#10;As for performing world actions, you can collect elves, heroes, artifact cards; remove Hel's anonymous minions or Surt's fire giants; or receive help from worldly creatures. If another god stands in this world, your action is improved; if an enemy stands in that world, then your action is penalized.&#10;&#10;In addition to that base game, you can play Yggdrasil Chronicles on the hard mode, which increases the challenge of gameplay while giving each god unique powers.

Each player starts with an army of 30 cards. The goal of the game is to score more Might than any of the other players.&#10;&#10;Each army has 10 Hero cards and 20 Might cards. Might cards are the scoring cards and have values between 1 and 10. Hero cards affect which Might cards are scored in a round.&#10;&#10;Hero cards are played in order from 1 to 4. Hero 1 cancels the effects of the other player&rsquo;s Hero card. Hero 2 reduces the lowest Might card to 0. Hero 3 reduces the highest Might card to 0. Hero 4 reduces both Might cards to 0.&#10;&#10;Each round is played by picking 1 Hero and 2 Might cards. After all Hero cards have been used, players score any Might cards remaining face up. After 10 rounds, all 30 cards in your army will have been used. Count up all scored Might cards. The player with the most Might is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The once bustling city hub has been hushed to stillness following an apocalyptic event and your goal is to forge a new future. Equip your shelter, manage your resources, and rally a community of various survivors, all while making your way through the jungle cityscape.&#10;&#10;Paris: New Eden features a clever dice-drafting mechanism that allows you to recruit survivors. Over the span of one year, you will endeavor to build your shelter and overcome the array of obstacles that you encounter along the way. The dice allow you to recruit survivors of different types: tinkerers, brawlers, healers, sages, farmers, jacks-of-all-trades, or even useless survivors. At the end of each season, your survivors allow you to bid to improve your shelter. These survivors are recruited in five key areas and central squares of the Paris that we know, each one with different abilities:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The train station, which lets you grow your community faster&#10;    The restaurant, to collect food to feed your community&#10;    The tower, to choose the goals you can fulfill&#10;    The center, which gives you access to special equipment&#10;    The bridge, to gain access to new missions&#10;&#10;&#10;Players score points by recruiting survivors and feeding them, by fulfilling objectives from the tower, and by completing secret missions acquired at the bridge. At winter&rsquo;s end, the player who has accumulated the most victory points wins. The future of Paris is in your hands!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
