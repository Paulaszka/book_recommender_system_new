Each has 100 armies to be distributed in certain countries on a map which is drawn at the start of the game. A series of battles are then fought with the object of neutralising enemy armies. The player retaining control of the most countries is the winner. There are three phases, in each of which the same player moves first.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: The players take turns to delineate one country on the map. This is done by drawing the boundary lines of a single enclosed area on a piece of plain paper. There are no restrictions on the size, shape or location of the countries, though it is recommended that they be drawn reasonably large. Twenty countries are to be drawn in the standard size game.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: The players take turns to allocate some of their armies to one unoccupied country. The number of armies allocated is written into the country concerned and that country is then regarded as occupied. The player taking first turn should identify his own allocations by boldly underlining his figures. Phase 2 continues until all countries are occupied or until both players have allocated all of their 100 armies.&#10;&#10;Phase 3: The players now take turns to conquer one or other of the opponent's countries. A country may be conquered if there are more of your armies in adjacent countries than your opponent has in the country under attack. Similarly your opponent may conquer one of your countries, at his turn, if he has a superiority of armies in adjacent countries. To qualify as &quot;adjacent&quot;, countries must have a visible length of common boundary. The number of armies in the conquered country is crossed out and they take no further part. The armies carrying out the attack are in no way depleted and may be used for other attacks later in the game. The object of the game is to retain more of your own occupied countries than the opponent retains of his. Note that countries you conquer don't contribute to your score but merely reduce your opponent's score by one as he will have retained one less country at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The best strategy depends, in complex ways, upon the original map. Several tips are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Create &quot;buffer&quot; countries to protect weak countries during phase 2.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Avoid crowding enemy-held countries at the start of phase 3.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The first countries to attack in phase 3 are not necessarily the strongest of the enemy-held countries, but those which, by teamwork, can most damage your position.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;Eric Solomon, Games with Pencil and Paper&#10;&#10;"

The goal of each player is to connect their corresponding sides of the board with a continuous line of pieces.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;     On their turn, each player can place one octagonal piece on any free octagonal place on the board.&#10;     If a piece is placed diagonally to a piece of the same color, a square of that color is placed to connect them (it is possible to place up to 4 squares by placing just one octagon).&#10;     If a piece is placed diagonally to a piece of the same color and there is a square of the opponent's color in between them, the opponent's square is replaced by a square of the player's color. The opponent's octagons are no longer connected by the square that was there. This is called a &quot;cut&quot;.&#10;     Whenever a player performs a &quot;cut&quot;, the opponent can then play two times in a row (it should be noted that if a player performs a &quot;cut&quot; on the first of two consecutive turns, they lose the second turn and it's the opponent's turn to play twice).&#10;     A player only wins when they connect their respective sides of the board and it is impossible for the opponent to ever break that connection with a &quot;cut&quot;.

I am excited to have this opportunity to bring back into print and enhanced version of my original Peloponnesian War design that was originally published by Victory Games. This military game of ancient warfare lets YOU chart the destiny of the war. Peloponnesian War uses a still-unique solitaire system that was a pioneer in this genre, yet was never copied.&#10;&#10;Most current solitaire systems on the market today have the player take one side for the entire game. This pits the player against a random 'Bot system, even the best of which have some difficulty giving you the same challenge as playing against a human opponent. In Peloponnesian War, you get to play both sides, pitting yourself against the best that YOU can offer. If the game system is winning, the player is forced to continue with the losing side. Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory. In this manner the player competes against himself in the classic tradition of the Greek tragedy. - Mark&#10;&#10;From the opening of the Archadameian War in 431BC to the Fall of Athens in 404, The Peloponessian War allows YOU to compete against the man in the mirror, as you live through the suicide of Greece. Maneuver your generals, hoplites, and navies to fight battles and attempt to bring the war to an end on your terms. Take heed, however. As you weaken your foe, you create a greater game challenge for yourself. For as you improve in strength, so does your opponent.&#10;&#10;In terms of physical components, Mark's enhanced version is getting the full GMT treatment: mounted map and strategy boards, high-quality thick counters, redesigned rules and playbook, all with new art throughout. This will be a product that you'll want to own and play for a long time! We hope you enjoy this enhanced GMT version of Mark Herman's classic solitaire game design.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
