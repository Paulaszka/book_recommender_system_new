How to play The two players take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines between two adjacent points.  If a player completes the fourth side of a square, he marks that square with the initial of his name (or a letter of recognition) and must immediately draw another line (as if it were an extra turn).  When all squares have been filled, the player who has captured the most squares is the winner.&#10;&#10;SNAKES It is the &quot;pen and paper&quot; version of an old video game.  How to play It is played on a 7 x 7 point matrix.  The first player starts from the green &quot;S&quot; point in the upper left, while the other starts with the red &quot;S&quot; point in the lower right, as shown in the image.  Players take turns growing their snake, extending it one segment at a time by drawing a horizontal or vertical line from the previous point to an adjacent one.  The first player unable to move loses.&#10;&#10;MOM VS PAPPA It is a &quot;pen and paper&quot; strategy game: the aim is to recreate the word MOM for one player and the word PAPPA on the grid for the other. At the beginning of the game, the players decide who plays for PAPPA (inserting the letters P and A) and who for MOMMA (inserting the letters Me A).  On his turn, the player inserts one of the two letters of his word in any box, without having to use the same letter every turn.  The player who is the first to spell his word horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.&#10;&#10;CHINESE WALL is a simple and fun game.  The aim is to be the last player to create a wall that spans three territories.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

While Home, you can gain points and abilities by playing cards onto your yard and swaying Neighbors to your side. While Away, you can earn money and get new cards from a shared store, but you leave your yard vulnerable to your rival's mischief. When the last Neighbor has been swayed, the game ends, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

You can take any number of references as your starting point: Mad Max, Last of Us, The Walking Dead, etc.  All will be revealed as you play!&#10;&#10;The five chapters of the campaign are grouped into five adventure packs including everything you need to play: terrain that forms the game board, characters to interact with, objects, narrative cards, etc. Some cards describe what is seen, found, and met; symbols indicate how each card is used. Depending on your actions and events in the scenario, you can turn over these cards and change the playing field, situation, objects, and characters as you advance through the story in your adventure.&#10;&#10;No matter the player count, four player characters are controlled by the players, while Swan, the youngest member of the family, is a non-playable character. Each character has three action tokens, and you collectively decide in which order to use them to make your characters act out the story you're telling. (Some actions may or must be done by multiple characters at once for maximum effect.) By using the tokens on your character's cards (head, torso, legs), you can talk to other characters, look around, move, fight, or get better items. Each card can also be combined with equipment cards, whose location is indicated using a system of matching symbols. Equipment gives you additional actions or helps you do things. You can switch equipment between games or create new items to use. If your character gets hurt, they can't perform certain actions.&#10;&#10;A &quot;karma&quot; deck is used during checks and combat and can potentially change the outcome of your actions. During the campaign, this deck transforms to match your choices and will influence your morale, actions, story evolution, and ending of the game.&#10;&#10;The game has no fixed order of moves. Instead players follow the &quot;time line&quot; of cards that controls the game's events. The scenarios are written, but your actions lead to cards moving along the timeline as you explore one part of a scenario or another. This makes it possible to create a deeply narrative game without the need for an app.&#10;&#10;"
