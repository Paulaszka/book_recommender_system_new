It uses an action-point system that requires no book-keeping. The rules are designed to be simple, fast and fun so that a mini campaign of several games can be played in a single evening.&#10;&#10;The game uses only 6 sided dice and requires approximately 5-10 models per player. The rules recommend 15 mm figures on a 60x60cm play area, but can be played in other scales. There is nothing scaled in inches or centimetres, three measuring sticks to measure all distances and ranges. Alternatively the game can be played without measuring sticks on a hexgrid.&#10;&#10;The game includes statistics for 180+ monsters and heroes, and details to be able to create your own. Also there are campaign rules where your warband grows more powerful after every battle, and six basic scenarios.&#10;&#10;There are some stand-alone games based on the same system, which could also be used as expansions to the base game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Song of Arthur and Merlin (2008) - Arthurian supplement featuring sections on the historical Dark Ages king, the Welsh legendary king, and the Hollywood king.

The object is to be the fastest over three legs or three runs over the entire track.  In the 1980's the sport was a bit different.  Road sections were over public streets and going too fast or too slow garnered a time penalty. The Special stages were over closed public roads, private roads or trails in rural areas and speed was not restricted. In the game, the Road sections have a set number of dice throws in which a player is to travel the section with his car.  You may roll one or two D6 that have numbers 1,2 or 3 on the faces. Finishing in less rolls garners a 10 second penalty and finishing in too many rolls gets a 5 second penalty. For each special stage, a card is drawn with details of that stage and players must try and choose the best tyres for that stage, with weather conditions being a contributing factor.  Then an Unexpected Weather condition card is drawn.  The tire choice combined with info from the two cards modify the die rolls during the Special stage. The player then chooses to roll the red die that has more pips and two crash faces or the blue die with less pips and only one crash face. Along the Special stages are spaces that result in car damage if a player lands on those spaces. Prior to starting the race each player may place Repair Stations along the Road sections to repair damages incurred along the Specials stages. If a player lands on a Damage space in the first Special stage, that Damage penalty, 10 seconds, will be applied thereafter to each section until the player meets the requirement for entering one of his Repair Stations.  The player who completes the three Legs in the fastest time wins the rally/game.&#10;&#10;Basically a roll and move game with a bit of flare within the theme of the sport as it was conducted at the time of the game's production.&#10;&#10;This being a game for the Pirelli tire company, there is more information concerning tires in the game materials than is necessary to play the game.  The only tyres available are from Pirelli and the game materials seek to show how each tyre should be used, with the rulebook containing a lot of information about how rallies were organized and run at that time and how to choose tyres for each stage.&#10;&#10;"

Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.&#10;&#10;This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Jenseits von Theben&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Knights and magicians in their service are sent to the provinces to conquer their opponents.&#10;But the methods of magicians and knights are very different. The knights turn to their swords and must slog overland from province to province. Meanwhile, the magicians can make use of the secret magical places and appear by surprise in an area that the knights believe is already secured for their own side. And so the struggle surges to and fro until one side attains power.&#10;What is unique in &lsquo;Power &amp; Weakness&rsquo;, is that two games are played at once; one game for magical control and one game for military control.

At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a mission. The possible missions vary depending on the player's role, intruder or intercepter.&#10;&#10;The missions include reconnaissance, space exploration, piracy, raid, and patrol (under either a &quot;cold war&quot; status or active hostilities). Each mission provides conditions for a &quot;strategic victory&quot; (such as capturing the other vessel, making peaceful contact, etc.) and orders which, if violated, will prevent the player from gaining a &quot;command victory&quot; (e.g., a player might be ordered to not fire first). Victory points are given for strategic, command, and tactical victories (the latter being based on ship damage), and these are compared to see who won (if anyone, as a possible outcome is that neither player wins).&#10;&#10;The game takes place in three-dimensional space, but the hex map is only used to show the relative positions of the ships. Markers placed on the map show a ship's vertical distance above or below the plane. A small map can be used because at the start of each turn the map is effectively rotated to put the Z-axis at the center along the line between the ships.&#10;&#10;Players write down and execute their movement and firing orders simultaneously. The main concern in battle is preventing one's systems from overheating, which can occur due to acceleration/deceleration as well as combat.&#10;&#10;While the game's envelope gives the publication year as 1976, all the components say 1975. It seems possible the envelope was added to the game after the first copies were produced.&#10;&#10;"
