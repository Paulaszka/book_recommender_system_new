For the first round, participants will have to draw in less than 30 seconds the first word of their card.&#10;&#10;The start is given through the hourglass, and when a player has finished his drawing, he returns his paper and rushes to catch one of the chips placed in the center of the table by focusing on the strongest. Once the time fully elapsed, latecomers should stop drawing and rushing on the chips.&#10;&#10;All drawings will now be unveiled simultaneously and each participant can take one he thinks he can guess. Each player wins the number of points indicated on the token, if and only if an opponent manages to guess the drawing.

Between 1665 and his death in 1680, Riquet was completely anbsorbed by the planning, financing and construction of his canal system.  Sections of it, including the Canal de Garonne, remained unfinished until the 19th century.&#10;&#10;You can relive the adventure of building the canal, section by section, between Grisolles and Valence d'Agen in the heart of the Tarn-et-Garonne. Each player is an engineer who must use their best workers to build the greatest length of the Arriala (cannal in the Occitan language of southern France). You can move all workers, but only those on your team will gain you fame points for completing sections. The placement of your workers when construction is completed is critical.  Your aim is to have the most workers on a stretch of canal when it is completed.  Ties are broken in favour of the player placed third. It is also possible to build locks to alter sections of the canal and create new ones. However, the number of points awarded depends on the length of the section: a lock may win you a majority, but at what price?&#10;&#10;Points can also be scored for building structures, though this sacrifices a worker (five maximum per player) for the rest of the game. What's more, your expertise also extends to cultivating the  vines that make this region famous and will bring you valuable points when the game ends.&#10;&#10;"

Over the next five weeks, the ship visited four of the islands of the archipelago.   During these visits, Darwin collected 37 bird specimens he thought unique.  While traveling home, Darwin pondered the variations in beak size of the mockingbirds and finches he had collected.  These slight variations in beak structure, along with other small differences observed in both plants and animals he collected, were the beginnings of a radical new thought in how species came to exist.  Over the next fourteen years, Darwin expanded upon these ideas ultimately publishing his controversial treatise The Origin of Species in 1859.&#10;&#10;In this game, players help four species of finch evolve and spread throughout the Galapagos archipelago from one common ancestor.  Species evolve and migrate as they try to dominate the habitable population centers on the islands.  Each species of finch has a preferred habitat, ground or tree, and preferred food source, insects or seeds.  Players can affect the dominate species by increasing the food source or habitat type of a particular species.  At the game end, the player who has the most valuable finch collection is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

You can profit from the market simply by buying low and selling high. But watch the transaction fee which can significantly eat into your profit. You can also earn income through dividend issued by companies you are holding and other investment opportunities available in the market. However, you should not over-invest because you may need urgent cash to support your expenses. Being the major shareholder also allows you to exploit the cash reserve of the company to benefit yourself. The person who can obtain the maximum wealth at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;This is a stock market game in which the players buy and sell stocks in 5 companies.  Stock prices fluctuate according to the market position which is driven by a die roll.  Each company's stock behave very differently.  Event cards trigger the paying of dividends,  right issues, share allotments, and such.  Each company also accumulates a cash reserve which is split among its shareholders at game end (or sooner if the company becomes privatized).&#10;&#10;This is an original game designed and published in Hong Kong.&#10;&#10;"

Bulls with heavy tools give high victory points, but they have several weaknesses. Some of the bulls are not &quot;doing it&quot; in a safe way. Other bulls are lazy, hungry, noisy, bull shitters or not very smart or handy.&#10;&#10;The game works as a standalone but can be combined with &quot;Koe zoekt Boer&quot; (Happy Cows) and &quot;Gooishe Koeien&quot; (Trendy Cows).&#10;There also is a special card that is an expansion to &quot;Koe zoekt Boer&quot;. This is the Power Bull, which allows you to take over a turn of another player. This way turning the nice teasing game Koe zoekt Boer in a really nasty party game.&#10;&#10;"

It was originally envisioned as a medium-complexity wargame to fall somewhere between the existing designs, Axis and Allies and World in Flames, which were either too pedestrian for us hard-core, grognard wargamers or too massive to be played within the confines of our housing. This final version is exactly what we envisioned when we started: a fun game about WWII with a lot of meat, but not so complicated that you need to be an accountant to enjoy it.&#10;&#10;The game scale, the 3-map composition, and the use of megahexes to regulate naval movement were originally set by Peter and Randall. They are the only elements that remained intact throughout development. While designer John D. Powers had to make many trade-offs between realism and playability, the latter was the primary concern. Once the nuances of the system are understood and exploited by all players, you will find that historical strategies will yield surprisingly historical results.&#10;&#10;I hope that players find it to be enjoyable, and despite its high-level, granular view, the most accurate grand strategic game about WWII yet to be published.&#10;&#10;What You Get&#10;&#10;     2 22x34 inch full color maps&#10;     1 17x22 inch full-color map&#10;     4 Full-color, die-cut sheets of 5/8 inch counters&#10;     1 Book of Rules&#10;     1 Book of Scenarios&#10;     Charts and Tables&#10;     Dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(source: One Small Step website )&#10;&#10;"
