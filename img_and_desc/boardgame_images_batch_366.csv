A transparent mask is placed on top of the board. The mask contains five holes and therefore leaves five numbers open. &#10;A player now rolls a number of dice (4-7, depending on the location of the mask) and tries to calculate the open numbers by addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. If he or she manages to get to the right result, he or she places a chip on that number.

A car company has to project the demands of the market, and plan years in advance to deliver a finished product.  This must all be arranged and negotiated before a new car hits the sales lot. After all the effort, having the best design or the most efficient production process by no means ensures that a car will be a market sensation. Auto Nation lets players use these factors to power their car companies in this staple of American Industry.&#10;&#10;"

It comes in a bag containing 24 stretchy bands, called &quot;Booga-Bands&quot;, and a bamboo dice shaker. Each player gets four Booga Bands in a single color, and places them on their arms and legs as desired. The dice shaker is a bamboo tube that has two chambers, one holding colored dice and one holding one black and one white die. When shaken, one dice from each chamber appears in a small window on the side of the tube.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they shake the dice and get two dice in the window. The black die means feet, white means hands. The colored die shows the band color that must be connected. So, if a player rolls white and red, he must connect one his hands (the white die) to any red wristband. In short order, the players get connected and twisted up in all kinds of hilarious ways! A very fun game from Uncle Skunkle.&#10;&#10;"

While the Germans, British, French, Porugese, and Russians used their economic and diplomatic power to handle the Imperial Court effectively, there was a popular resentment towards foreign hegemony. This found its expression in a secret society called The Righteous Harmonious Fists, or to Westerners, &quot;Boxers.&quot; Tens of thousands of western troops were deployed, and numerous small actions comprised The Boxer Rebellion.&#10;&#10;"

Simultaneously, the game allows a world of canals and noble savages, a cold high altitude desert globe, a nearly airless planet, terraforming, nanotech cyberpunk and everything in between from 100+ years of science fiction stories set on Mars.  The game further captures the mood of those stories and the feel of the planet.  The game uses a further refinement of the wrap-around mechanism used in Lunar Rails to simulate travel across a 3D  opposed to a 2D map.  Having to think in 3D wraparound mode adds additional &quot;brain-burn&quot; to the Empire Builder franchise... sometimes the shortest distance between two points isn't the obvious straight line.&#10;&#10;See crayon rail games for more crayon fun.&#10;&#10;"
