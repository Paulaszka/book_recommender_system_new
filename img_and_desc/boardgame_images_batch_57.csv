Beyond the standard scenario there are provided additional rules and types of ships for players to devise their own scenarios.

There is a series of games for different age levels, all designed to familiarize players with these architectural styles.&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&quot;GOOD OLD HOUSES is a series of games about American architecture. The objective in all the games is to entertain while building an awareness of some basic architectural styles. The houses in this set are illustrations of general styles rather than portrayals of specific, existing buildings. (Neighborhood houses seldom show all the style traits illustrated here. In some houses only a single feature makes a style recognizable, while in others there is a mixture of style traits.) The range of styles, from Federal to Bungalow, isn't intended to encompass the breadth of American architectural history, but to represent the basic building styles most frequently employed between the late 18th and early 20th centuries when the greatest thrust of settlement and urban development occurred in the United States. After playing the games in GOOD OLD HOUSES, players will be more observant of houses in their own neighborhoods and better able to describe what they see.&#10;&#10;&quot;The eight house puzzles (12 pieces per puzzle) are used in four different games for 2 to 8 players. The games are divided into three levels determined by age: under 8, 8 and over, 10 and over.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.&#10;&#10;The board has two tracks: A &quot;Rat Race&quot; small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a &quot;Fast Track&quot; where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.&#10;&#10;With each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.&#10;&#10;The game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.&#10;&#10;There are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.&#10;&#10;"

At any stage in the game after moving, the player may elect to turn their own master wheel in any direction. If this succeeds in turning the opponent's master wheel in the direction of the arrow marked on it, then the active player wins; if the opponent's master wheel fails to move or goes in the wrong direction, the active player loses.&#10;&#10;"

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings!&#10;&#10;In this exciting board game, each player, or team of players, takes on the role of Frodo Baggins and seeks to destroy the One Ring by throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom.

Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.&#10;&#10;2) Stocks&#10;Stocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.&#10;&#10;3) Car&#10;In Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.&#10;&#10;4) Bonds&#10;Bonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares.
