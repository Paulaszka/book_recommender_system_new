Only one is chosen during the Setup.&#10;&#10;The game is divided in four phases, performed in the following order: Expansion, Intrigue, Coronation, and Assassination. During the Expansion Phase the players place Ally Tiles to create a 6x6 grid. During the Intrigue Phase, the players can swap positions of Ally Tiles to enhance the position of their Allies. In the Coronation Phase the Houses gain points, according to the Objective, and the Ruling House is the House with the most points. Then, in the Assassination Phase, the players votes to eliminate the player who they think owns the Regent House.&#10;&#10;The game ends right after the Assassination Phase and the winner is the player that represents the Ruling House, in case the assassination failed; or the player that represents the House with most points among the assassins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Each thesis emphasises three of the five available resource categories: Science, Magic, Components, Flesh and Energy.&#10;&#10;To gather resources, they have to build a laboratory which transform, splits or fuses resources or teleports them all over the place. The players vie for space and race against time to gather the right material in a chaotic card game with a modular playing field and engine-building elements.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of three phases: In the first phase a player adds a tile to or modifies a tile of their laboratory to give it more functions, like turning certain resources into others, duplicating resources or fusing certain resources into more resources of another kind. A smartly planned lab can set of chain reactions to create lots of the wanted resources from any kind of original resource.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, they can choose to either feed a new, randomly determined resource into their lab, or let resources in the lab go into the next stage of a reaction.&#10;&#10;In the third phase, they can turn in resources gathered in their lab for points or special action cards, which can help them or hinder other players through various bonuses. Turning in resources for points reveals a players thesis to other players, so they can better try to sabotage their labs.&#10;&#10;After fifteen rounds, the player who turned in the most relevant sets for their thesis wins. There are multiple strategies to build a functioning lab with their own risks and rewards, and until the last turn there can often be dramatic changes in the score.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The number in each square of the matrix equals power, and Red and Blue are equally powerful.  During the game, players use colored tokens to group the squares into 9 districts, one square at a time.  As districts are formed, power becomes unevenly allocated.  Red controls some districts, Blue controls others.  The game ends when one token occupies each square and there are no legal moves remaining.  Whoever controls more districts is the winner.&#10;&#10;The idea is simple, but play is incredibly challenging.  To win, you must cleverly spread your power across many districts while concentrating your opponent's power into few districts.  This is how election districts are rigged, or gerrymandered, in the real world.  But, in Distrix, an opponent responds to your every move.  Each district is a tug-of-war that you want to win narrowly or lose by a lot.  But be careful...you may accidentally win it by too much or barely lose it!  Nine districts are in play, so there's a lot to keep your eye on.  Spatial awareness is critical because the shape of one district affects another.  And there's a special rule in the endgame--that allows squares to be reassigned from large districts to adjacent smaller ones--that can thwart even the best game plan, turning an expected victory into a stunning defeat.  Overall, it's a pure battle for power where basic arithmetic, spatial awareness, move timing, and move counting make all the difference.&#10;&#10;A devilishly challenging affair, Distrix has the conceptual simplicity, aesthetic elegance, and strategic sophistication typical of classic games like chess and go.

Play a fast-paced card game of sandwich action, or learn the deeper tactical mode to make your topping king of the sandwich.&#10;&#10;In the Gas Station Sandwich mode, you compete to add your topping cards on the sandwich faster than anyone else. Toppings must match, but bread is a wildcard: anything can go on bread, and bread goes on anything, except bread doesn't go on bread. Bread on bread is not a sandwich.&#10;&#10;To win the game here, you race your opponents through 4 hands of 4, playing a card each turn. But if you can overlap more than 2 symbols on the sandwich, madness can ensue. Overlap 3, and give an enemy a card! Overlap 4, and you chain another turn, to place another card.&#10;&#10;For the Tactical Sandwich War, territory cubes are added and you can protect parts of the sandwich as your own as you fight for dominance, representing one topping. To win the game, be the first to reach 25 of your topping on the sandwich. On your turn, you play a card with the goals of covering opponents' toppings with bread, gathering guard cubes, blocking off portions of the sandwich for your own use, protecting your own toppings... or preparing to ruin someone else's day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
