Tom Wham's younger sisters couldn't say the word elephant when they were toddlers so they said &quot;halfanutz&quot; instead.&#10;&#10;The basic game consists of walkabout and scoring phases.  In the walkabout phase the player draws a card.  Then they can either push their luck and draw another card or they can take the cards they already have behind their screen and pass the turn to somebody else.  If they draw a card with the same picture as a card they already have, they lose the cards they've drawn and their turn.  After all the cards have been drawn, the scoring phase happens.  Players sort their cards by the resource pictured on it, then count the largest pile of cards and subtract the smallest pile of cards.  After two sessions the scores are totaled and a winner declared.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds resources and a trick taking phase (called &quot;the rumble&quot;).  During the walkabout for each card turned over, the player also gets a resource of the type on the card.  The player gets to keep the resource, even if the cards end up being discarded.  During the trick taking phase, the players randomly play a card from the cards they have collected.  The cards are numbered and the highest number wins.  The twist is that your card can be reinforced by resources of the same type as the card played.  The players take turns reinforcing their cards or passing.  The player with the highest card number + resources played wins the trick.  Players then score the number of cards they have taken during the rumble.  Again, two sessions are played and the scores are totaled.&#10;&#10;The tournament game is like the advanced game, except the card played during the rumble is not chosen randomly.&#10;&#10;Halfanutz is self-published by Tom Wham and is available from his web site, http://www.tomwham.com.&#10;&#10;"
