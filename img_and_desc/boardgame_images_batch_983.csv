You then look at the cards remaining in front of you and collect points: 10 points if you have one or more llama cards, and points equal to the card value, with each number card counting only once. If you discarded all of your cards, you can discard a previously collected point token.

Each player creates a squad of 5 warriors from a selection of 50, then squares off against the enemy in a furious close-combat fight.&#10;&#10;After each player deploys their warriors, the members of each squad are revealed and the battle begins. Each warrior has a unique ability, realm traits, and a racial restriction. Players alternate turns with one warrior acting at a time based upon the order determined in their deployment. A warrior can use their turn to attack the enemy squad by rolling a d10 and allocating damage (called a Standard Attack) or by using their warrior ability or realm ability as an alternate way to deliver damage or otherwise alter the flow of battle.&#10;&#10;While many warriors have offensive abilities, many others have defensive, retaliatory, healing, summoning, or a wide variety of other abilities. The interactions and synergies of the warriors each player selects for their squads will have a major impact on the battle. The first player to reduce all enemy warriors to zero health wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

It is possible to harness their large political prowess in order to make quick gains, but at the cost of becoming less and less moderate, which may eventually hamper your possibility to win the long game.&#10;&#10;The map represents the political reality of Europe in the Interbellum, divided in six scoring regions (Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain and the Little Entente of Yugoslavia, Romania and Czechoslovakia).&#10;&#10;Play progresses over three periods: The Roaring Twenties, followed by the Great Depression and finally the Appeasement period.&#10;&#10;Europe is in Turmoil again!

Last car on the track is the winner!&#10;&#10;Inspired by retro top-down racing video games, this board game adaptation lets teams of two take the wheel of a fast and furious, bustling bluffing bonanza. Because the theme of the race is &quot;top-down&quot; the drivers can't really see where they're going and must trust in the collective movement of the pack. Just follow the leader, but does the leader know they way or is he/she just trying to trick you into driving off the road?&#10;&#10;Out-smart your opponents, or collect power-ups, weapons to use against them. It pays to be in the lead, but as soon as you stop trusting in whoever is in front of you, you must slow down to have time to react, and before you know it, you'll fall behind!&#10;&#10;This bluff filled party game plays well with an even number of players, from 4 to 10. You can help your team mate by passing them information when they need it the most, or prevent them from crashing at a crucial moment by clever card play. As the race goes by, the road becomes more predictable and players may be tempted to take their chances in order to gain the much desired lead. Since the track is randomly generated, the finish line could come suddenly. In order for you (and your team mate) to win, you must be the first to cross the finish line, or have the last car on the track!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

It had been snowing heavily since the morning, and the three-star chef George Osgood had closed his renowned establishment, as he did every year, in order to celebrate with his family and employees in an intimate setting.&#10;&#10;At 63, George wanted to retire in the new year. That&rsquo;s why he announced that he would be revealing his successor this evening. Everyone was awaiting his decision with bated breath.&#10;&#10;The two chefs, Marcus and Henry, both vying to be George&rsquo;s successor, served an impressive four-course menu. Everyone ate and drank copious amounts. The evening promised to be an unforgettable one.&#10;&#10;To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, George did not announce his successor during dinner, but by midnight, when the New Year was due to be welcomed with a glass of champagne on the terrace, the evening has taken an unfortunate turn. As the fireworks display over Aspen Mountain started flaring up on the horizon, the renowned chef was found dead on the terrace. Judging by the position of his body, somebody had thrown him head first over the balcony.&#10;&#10;The police were informed immediately. Because of the heavy snow, they will not reach the on-mountain restaurant for another few hours. Until the authorities arrive, you are all on your own in solving the mystery. What happened this evening? How could this New Year&rsquo;s celebration have ended so tragically?&#10;&#10;What is a murder mystery game?&#10;&#10;You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.&#10;&#10;You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.&#10;&#10;Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.&#10;&#10;Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.&#10;&#10;GAME CONTENT:&#10;1 Game Manual, 7 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 7 name badges, 1 support code&#10;&#10;&mdash; description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;"
