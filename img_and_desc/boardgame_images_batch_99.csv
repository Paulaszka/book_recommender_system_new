The Battle of the Piave, also called the &quot;Battle of the Solstice&quot; in Italy, was a part of the last desperate offensive of the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire to bring about a decision in its war with Italy. After its failure the disintegration of the Habsburg forces accelerated. This situation presented the Italian leadership with the opportunity to score a glorious military victory in the last days of the war in order to enhance the Italian stature at the peace conference to follow in Paris. The resulting battle is called Vittorio Veneto, like Waterloo, sharing its name with a town north of the actual battlefield.&#10;&#10;The 11&quot; x 17&quot; map represents the Italian battlefield using large hexes with contact boxes between. The 280 counters represent the combat forces involved in the struggle.&#10;&#10;"

As more cards are drawn, the players build up a grand tale, using their descriptions of the scenes played as components.  Players can chose not to pass or not to play the cards they have drawn.  As the activity is purely cooperative, no one can interrupt or contradict each other's contribution to the tale that is being spun.&#10;&#10;"

Each army has (in descending order of strength) one leader, one wizard, three bowmen, four pikemen, and four warriors.  They also have two shield-bearers.  On the back of each chit is simply an orc face or a human face, which, if used in combat, is lower than a warrior.&#10;&#10;On a given turn, each player secretly selects three units, keeping the remaining units face down in front of him.   The players take turns dropping them onto a cloth surface (tablecloth or towel on a table) from about a foot above the table (30 cm).  Whichever side they land face up is their strength for the current round.&#10;&#10;Certain faces have different abilities, however:&#10;&#10;     a human or orc face allows you to call for reinforcements (one additional chip from your unused chips) for each face showing),&#10;     a shield bearer allows you to protect one unit in the upcoming combat&#10;     a wizard may force a re-drop of all pieces except itself&#10;     a leader allows you re-drop any one chip (morale).&#10;&#10;&#10;After all special abilities are used, line up your troops from strongest to weakest, and compare with your opponents.   The two strongest fight each other, with the loser removed from the game (remove both in case of ties).  Then the next two strongest fight, etc.  Shield bearers can be assigned to any chips.  A shielded chip attacks but may not be killed - remove the shield from the game, instead.&#10;&#10;When one side loses its leader, the game is over and the other side is victorious.&#10;&#10;While it sounds simple, your choices are actually not always easy.  If you risk your leader and it lands the wrong side up, it's the weakest piece on the board.  You can call for reinforcements, but units used in earlier combats cannot be called until all combats with the units that started that round have been completed.&#10;&#10;For those who dislike the mechanic of dropping chips, you could use a die roll, coin flip, or card cut for each piece to determine its facing.&#10;&#10;"

In your turn you must move to an adjacent segment and you can then take the track allowed by the new segment that you are in. Furthermore, next turn, you cannot move back into the segment you were in at the start of your last turn (In other words, you cannot go to and from between the same two segments). However, it is possible to impede an opponent because no two players may be in the same segment. As up to six can play, this board can get pretty crowded. In each segment (except for two special symbols) there are images that relate to the piece of track you receive. This track is laid on the tabletop area, there is no board on which they are to be placed. Therefore, your direction and length of track is only limited by the size of your table!&#10;&#10;Track received must be added to one of your lines immediately. The objective is to build three independent lines that end up with a black tile (a station). When one player has achieved this, the game ends and you score a point for every track tile on your network. The most points, wins (note that this might not be the player that ended the game).&#10;&#10;"

11347,,"Seega is a very old game of indeterminate age, which may have been a descendent of the Roman Latrunculi and, ultimately, related to the Hnefatafl family, as the &quot;sandwiching&quot; method of capture is identical.  Seega persists today in parts of North Africa. It is played on a 5x5 board (a &quot;Knights&quot; solitaire board is ideal for this) with each player having 12 pieces (usually marbles).  Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. &quot;sandwiching&quot;). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.   Variants are played on larger boards (8 x 8 etc.) and/or with different capturing conditions, such as jumping, as in draughts/checkers.&#10;&#10;"

Remember, players are free to place pieces on any square on the board without being required to touch a previously played piece.&#10;&#10;The pathways will turn and wind and even cross over themselves as the two players attempt to out-maneuver each other.
