Players act as farmers and operate a cart in which they will harvest produce and deliver them to the five villages to sell. Additionally, players will compete for Produce Order cards, which reward Lira points for selling desirable produce in specific villages. Players track sold produce in each village using their Fulfillment Cards.

Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points.

Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated.

The board contains a 5 x 5 squared grid, with the squares in two of the opposite corners being of a different colour to the rest, and designated as Castles. Each player has a set of five plastic pieces. These are cup-shaped and placed &lsquo;upside down&rsquo; on the board. Inside one cup of each set is a marker which identifies the piece as a Spy.&#10;&#10;The objectives of the game are to manoeuvre one's Spy into the enemy Castle and to discover the whereabouts of the opposing Spy. The achievement of either of these will cause that player to win the game.&#10;&#10;At the start, the players set out their pieces on the five squares immediately in front of their own Castle, remembering which piece is the Spy. During his turn a player may move any one of his pieces in any direction as many squares as he wishes. A piece is not allowed to jump over nor occupy the same square as another piece. Instead of moving, a player may choose to interrogate an enemy piece. This is done by moving one of his pieces to rest orthogonally adjacent to the piece to be questioned, and on the next turn asking if it is the Spy. The other player must identify the piece so questioned. If it is the Spy, then the questioner has won the game; however if it is not, then the asking player loses his piece, and if the asking piece was the Spy, then he also loses the game. The rules do not state that it is illegal to occupy one&rsquo;s own Castle, but one must assume that it is, in order to avoid stalemate. Also the rules do not make it clear as to what happens when a player has all his pieces blocked and cannot move on his turn.&#10;&#10;Bluffing is an important part of the game. It is not mandatory to interrogate a piece, even having moved into position to do so, neither is it obligatory to remain in position to be questioned. One can thus chase an opposing piece around the board only to discover eventually that it was a decoy, and in the meantime the enemy Spy is well positioned to enter one&rsquo;s own stronghold.&#10;&#10;As it is only permissible to enter a Castle orthogonally, it is possible to set up an impregnable defence, by placing a piece on the squares either side of it. This ploy however, will limit the number of pieces that one can move, and unless one employs the Spy as a defender, increases the chances of one&rsquo;s Spy being exposed.&#10;&#10;"

During this operation, the british dropped by parachute must capture the radar, one or two german operators, destroy the manor and finally embark all in the waiting Landing Craft Assaults.&#10;&#10;The game is edited under ziplock and contains a A3-size map depicting Bruneval surroundings at night (scale at 1/25000), 108 counters (the 3 formation of British paratroopers Drake, Nelson and Rodney ; german coastal defense, luftwaffe guards, MGs, pill-boxes and part of 685th infantry regiment reinforcements ; activation and other markers).

The player plays the British side first each turn and then the activated german units fight, move and get reinforcements in this respective order. Except for the coastal defenses, the german units are not represented on the map at the beginning. Instead, several randomly selected activation markers are deployed in specific areas of the map. The combination of proximity to British units and alert level may trigger an activation marker that may hide from 0 to 4 german units. These activated units may then fight and move. German move is dictated by closest (in PM) and largest enemy stack or German stack. Combat is resolved by comparing the strength of both adjacent stacks modified by the presence of an officer, the terrain modifier and 1D6. Largest score inflicts one step loss to the other.&#10;The British must score at least 10 victory points to get a marginal victory. More than 20 is a decisive victory.

The tactical level is where starships engage in ship-to-ship combat around planets and warp points. The operational level is where you maneuver your fleet of starships across a star system to find where your enemy is hiding. Starship designs are simple, easy to create, and the combat system is quick enough to let players destroy dozens of starships in an evening.&#10;&#10;The campaign system allows a player to start an empire and control all aspects of expansion: research, construction, colonization, exploration, etc. in an attempt to build an empire. Designed with procedurally generated system generation and a non-player race generation, each campaign is literally unique. The campaign system has been made to be easily modified for custom games and the rules have a hundred additional pages of source materials to help create those custom games.&#10;&#10;Originally started as an upgrade of the Ultra Starfire rules, Solar Starfire is based on Ultra Starfire and has become a living work with new goals and purpose. The rules are being built by a new team of developers that have plans to continuously adapt and upgrade the game with new material, new release methods, and most of all - the new storyline. Solar Starfire was built specifically for the history of the Terran Solar Union and will continue to be expanded as the story line opens up new possibilities.&#10;&#10;Still using the unique tactical combat system designed in 1976, Solar Starfire is the same core gaming system as Starfire has always been. The new team is building free starter materials for new players to learn and demo the Starfire system, while the website maintains a community forum and a FREE downloads section with player-created materials and previously-available gaming materials for most editions of Starfire.&#10;&#10;"

Every element of the game is determined right on the Fast Action Cards.&#10;&#10;Back-to-Basics Baseball features a unique batter-pitcher interface.  Just like the real game, the action begins on the mound with the pitcher.  Using a modified log-5 methodology the batter and pitcher ratings are combined to arrive at every result.  While the ratings may look simplistic on the surface, they nail down each and every player to play on the diamond.  1961 Mickey Mantle will perform exactly as he did in real life.  As will role players like 1983 John Wockenfuss.&#10; Every facet of the game will come to life with amazing accuracy with Back-to-Basics Baseball.  Players will hit, pitch, field and steal bases just as they did in real life.&#10;&#10;"

Ali, players re-enact the story of &quot;Ali Baba &amp; the Forty Thieves&quot; &ndash; but as a push-your-luck memory game.&#10;&#10;Each round, one player takes the role of Ali while the other players are all thieves. These thieves must repeat, in turn and without error, an ever-growing list of objects &ndash; these objects being the treasures that Ali Baba covets and wants to steal. The question for Ali is whether to stop or not before he covets too much and ends up stuck in the cave, with the treasures falling into the hands of the thieves.&#10;&#10;Variant rules allow for only two to play Open Sesame.&#10;&#10;"
