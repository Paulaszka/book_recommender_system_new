The British reformed near El Alamein, just 90 miles from Alexandria. After the repulse of a hasty attack in mid-July, Rommel orchestrated a more careful assault for the end of the month. His mobile troops were to swing wide into the desert to flank the British line and unhinge it. Eighth Army was waiting, forewarned by ULTRA intercepts. Its new commander, Bernard Mongomery, arrayed his armor along the ridge of Alam el Halfa. The German assault would pit the tactical finesse of Afrika Korps against greater numbers of tanks and guns. A German victory might complete the clearance of North Africa; a British victory could spell the end of Afrika Korps. El Alamein uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;"

These cards have two halves, each with icons representing the influence in one or two of the groups. Every round each player selects one card secretly, touching the side of the card they want to be valid, then all players reveal/place their card simultaneously. The players add their played card to their display, overlapping the cards, so that only the half that they touched when revealing the card is seen. The other half is taken out of play for this game.&#10;&#10;Some cards show icons that allow you to collect victory points immediately.

There is a lot of randomness in the rounds that keeps it interesting to play. Even the best players will lose some rounds, but will eventually win more rounds than others.

If the player is victorious, he/she does not drink and may distribute that amount of drinks to the other player(s). &#10;Green Cards - These are known as the Rule Cards. Follow the rules or drink. Rule Cards are in effect until replaced by the next rule card that is placed on top.&#10;&#10;Red Boxes - The boxes on the bottom half of the Rules Cards are known as the Action Boxes. These are specific tasks that must be completed by the person that plays the card.&#10;&#10;Numbers on Cards - Located in the upper left corner of all cards. This is the number of drinks to be had if anyone breaks a rule or loses a challenge.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt four cards. Play begins to the left of the dealer. The first player can choose to play either color card to begin the game. The next player must play a card of the opposite color (or take a drink and skip their turn.)

It promotes interaction and laughter as the question cards tend to bring up old stories and funny instances that are unique to each set of friends that play the game. It involves thought and strategy, and is a great way to see which of your friends knows each other best.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to vote with the majority. Each player is given a rotating voting wheel that has a specific number on the back that represents themselves. After a question is read from the pile of question cards, each player rotates their voting wheel to display the number associated with the player they feel best represents the question. Once all players have chosen their vote and rotated the voting wheel to the appropriate number, all voting wheels shall be flipped over and set on the playing surface simultaneously. Once the votes are tallied up, any player that voted with the majority is awarded a point.&#10;&#10;If there is a tie, any players involved in the tie must try to persuade any players that are not involved in the tie to agree with their answer and swing their vote.&#10;&#10;"
194585,,"Fervour is a TCG under the LCG model. It is a simulation of a duel between two people in a world where people's beliefs become reality. Since emotions are the strongest feelings a person can have these are utilised to shape the environment to their favour.&#10;&#10;There are three main Unique mechanics in Fervour:&#10;&#10;1.    Single action turns: Just like in a real fight, initiative goes back and forth and you can guard, respond and counter. With one action per turn games are fast-paced and energetic and have multiple tactics available rather than always a single &ldquo;best play&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;2.    Re-set every round: At the start of each round most of the cards on the field are re-shuffled and your hand is drawn again. This makes the game fast from the first turn of the game while still keeping it consistent.&#10;&#10;3.    Each card is useful: Each card has an elemental ability. All cards you can&rsquo;t cast can be added to cards you can to buff them. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you can play all your cards or only one, both hands are good in their own way. Also when casting a card the top card of your deck is flipped and its elemental ability is added and if it&rsquo;s an emotion (your resources) then you play it and can use it on that turn.&#10;&#10;"

This made sure that the game was confusing and different every time so he was the only one who could win. The other gods really wanted to be better than Loki so they tried their best to beat him. So it became a tradition to gather around one of Loki&rsquo;s games. This festive tradition got the name Ramasjang.&#10;&#10;Gather your friends for a fun fast changing card game! It&rsquo;s fun and easy to shape like Loki the shapeshifter himself.&#10;&#10;Now each player is dealt seven cards. The cards have different rules which you generate every hand. The person who sits left to the dealer starts.&#10;&#10;The card laid on top of the discard pile has to match the suit or the number unless a rule says otherwise. If you can&rsquo;t lay a card you must pick a card from the deck. After picking up the card you have the possibility to lay it if possible and if you still can&rsquo;t go it&rsquo;s the next players turn.&#10;&#10;From here you can add new rules to the cards without any limits.  The idea as Loki changed the rules to win, here each of the player takes it in turn either during play or between hands to add to the rules.&#10;&#10;A player wins, in a singled hand game by getting rid of all his cards despite the rule changes.  In a longer point scoring game a player wins when they have the least points when an opponent hits a value agreed at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each round, players receive three human cards, each numbered 1-3, and one random special character card (Orochi, Susanoo, Oracle, Hermit, etc). They play one card simultaneously. If no one play Orochi, humans are safe and players who played a human with the lowest number score points. If Orochi is in play, humans are dead and the Orochi player scores points, but if both Orochi and Susanoo are in play, Susanoo slays Orochi and saves humans, and the Susanoo player steals points from the Orochi player. The game goes to next round after Orochi was played.&#10;Players should predict opponents' moves to score points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

He has sworn an Oath to lead the free world, and he won't let us fall! Yet the end is near.

Each card has two colored squares, so there are 6x4 colored squares in play.&#10;&#10;Each round, you may rotate one card or switch positions of two adjacent cards. You score points if you form a line of three or more squares of the same color. The more lines you form, the more points you score. Cards used to form lines are removed, but you may choose some of them to be reshuffled. Then new cards are placed to fill the cleared space. Repeat this process until no lines are formed.&#10;&#10;This game has puzzle and deck building factors. You should watch the play field closely to detect a big-point move.

The first player who calmed correctly may play a card that shares the same animal icon.&#10;&#10;The player who has emptied their hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#227;&#130;&#180;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#232;&#135;&#170;5&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#175;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#140;2&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#137;1&#227;&#129;&#139;3&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#187;&#138;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#179;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#163;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#179;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

These warlords are the clan leaders of specific territories.  Each have characteristics that are based on history.&#10;&#10;Players, in secret, choose a castle territory.  When all players choose their castle territory players place their castle into their castle territory.&#10;&#10;Clan tokens are placed in territories owned.  Players who wish to make certain warlords strong will stack clan tokens into these warlords.  Clan tokens represent both 1000 samurai and 1 HP for that character.&#10;&#10;Players make 3 actions in turn.  This happens twice which represents 1 decade or 1 round of play.  Players draw cards and get Clan Token bonuses after each half decade.&#10;&#10;Actions:  Bribe, attack, move, castle movement.&#10;&#10;Bribe:  Bribe an adjoining warlord by committing 1 clan token to the action.  11 or 12 must be rolled on the dice.  If successful the committed clan token goes on top of the enemy warlord and his character card is given to the attacking player.  The warlord has switched sides.  If the bribe is unsuccessful the committed clan token gets put into the clan token stack of the adjoining warlord.&#10;&#10;Attack:&#10;Attack an adjoining enemy.  Advance as many warlords and their samurai armies to the border of the enemy territory.  The enemy may play cards against you at this time, do defensive troop movements.  The attacker may also play cards against the enemy.  Once card play is completed the attacker must choose which warlord will go into the duel.&#10;&#10;The warlords duel!  D12's are rolled.  The attacker always gets +1 and the difference of the dice determines the damage.  Damage is counted by removing Clan Tokens from the stack of the warlord.  In a duel, the Clan Tokens now represent the HP of the warlord for the duel.  When Clan Tokens are gone the warlord is slain and the victor can move as many or no warlords and/or clan tokens into the claimed territory.&#10;&#10;Movement Action: During a player's turn they may move as many warlords and/or clan tokens from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.&#10;&#10;Castle Movement Action: requiring an entire decade (4 actions) a player may move their castle from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.&#10;&#10;Object of Game:&#10;Destroy all enemy castles.  If your castle remains standing you win.  Or, Dueling Samurai has a points scoring system that lets players end the game at the end of any half decade.  This being a tested tournament game, the points scoring system is easy to follow and very well developed.&#10;&#10;Card Play:&#10;Players may play cards at any time in the game, making this a highly engaging and interactive board game.  &#10;Bonus Cards: (Archers, Dueling Samurai, Horses and Ambush)  These have individual use in the game, but can also be combined during your turn to get more clan tokens.  There is a very challenging balance between hording these cards and using them for combat making the strategy very deep.&#10;&#10;Tournament Cards: (Sumo and Dojo)&#10;Host a tournament.  If you win there are big rewards.  If you lose it can be a devastating turning point.&#10;&#10;Attack Cards:  Religious Conversion, Spy, Ninja, Small Pox Demons, Demons, Revenge, Sniper Cannons, Riflemen, Battering Rams, Cannons, Navy, Assassin, Ronin, Pirates, Bandits, Inciting Revolt.  These cards (other than Ninja) can be played at any time in the game.  Each utilize D12 or D6 to deal damage.  1's are always fails and so are 2's on D12's.  On fails players roll against themselves.&#10;&#10;Defense Cards: These are used to block attack cards, often reversing the attack to a more devastating effect.  Some of them can be played anytime you are under attack, providing a defensive attack option.  Chinese medicine, Knife Cart, Furious Defense, Scouts, Gold, Bushido, Seppuku.&#10;&#10;Peace Cards:  These are used to create peace.

On the back of the game-map sheets were shown the assembly diagrams for the parts contained in the package and the game rules, in four languages, with numerous illustrations for clarification. The main fight rules were checkers/chess like: the pieces must enter the enemy squares to eliminate them, with some hierarchical precedencies: e.g. no foot soldiers could eliminate horse-mounted ones. Non dice were used anywhere in the games.&#10;&#10;From the publisher (translated):&#10;Little Big Horn - June 26, 1876 &ndash; n&deg;1456&#10;During the operations against the Sioux, General George Crook learned that a lot of Indians were gathering on the shore of the Little Big Horn. It was therefore given the order to enter the field. Divided into three columns, cavalry, infantry and artillery converged in the direction oi the Indian encampment. The 7th Horse was commanded by lieutenant-colonel George Armstrong Custer. Out of personal ambition he disregarded the orders ha had received and divided his regiment into three Columns without waiting for the main body of the army. As a matter of fact he wanted to surround the Indian camp with his regiment only. The Indians, led by Crazy Horse and Seated Bull, hindered the two side columns so that Custer was isolated in the middle. Five thousand Warriors attacked Custer and his 132 men and wiped them out an 26th June 1876.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;HOW TO START THE GAME&#10;One of the two players keeps the American Army and the other keeps the&#10;Indians.

Today a new, more sophisticated artificial intelligence has been developed. Its developer, the Programmer, has invited a number of people to participate in the ultimate test of their creation: a dinner party! By the end of the party, the guests attending must determine who among them are actually human and who are artificial intelligence posing as humans.&#10;&#10;During the game, players receive Backgrounds to help them assume the role of one of the party guests. Players then receive special character Traits which may be considered either Human or AI behaviors. By asking questions and observing the other guests' behavior over the course of the game, the human players try to work together to deduce who is AI.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, the humans know that AI have to follow certain protocols and programming. But since some players themselves may be AI, you can never fully trust anyone!&#10;&#10;Halfway through the game and again at the end, the players assign Suspicion Tokens to the other guests, representing the strength of their conviction that certain people are indeed AI... since it these are assigned anonymously, the AI also get to vote and can use their Suspicion to deflect attention away from themselves toward other guests. The attendees who arouse the most Suspicion reveal their identities to see whether or not the AI were caught and passed the Turing Test.&#10;&#10;The Turing Test is a social game by award-winning game designer Jay Little with additional development and extensive play testing by students from the University of Wisconsin-Stout. These students contributed to the game through a special Board Game Production &amp; Processes class Jay Little teaches at the university.&#10;&#10;"

Sounds great, right? Well, there's a problem. None of you are successful enough to buy your own seaplane, so you all pitched in and bought one together, which means that each day you all have to use the same plane to make all of the day's deliveries &ndash; and some of you aren't going to get paid. To make matters worse, the plane is in such disrepair that the instrumentation is broken, the compass demagnetized, and the windshield is covered in cracks, duct tape, and the remains of a few unfortunate seagulls, so the pilot might as well be flying blind...&#10;&#10;Each day in Island Hopper, players auction off the Captain's seat; the player who becomes the Captain is in charge of flying the plane for the day, but cannot make any deliveries of their own. To make their deliveries, the other players bribe the Captain to fly to the islands to which they need to go, thereby earning themselves cash. When it's time for the Captain to fly, the Captain must close his eyes, pick up their goods tokens, and attempt to land them in an island's harbor. A successful landing means that players can fulfill their contracts and the captain collects his bribe &mdash; but if the goods splash into the sea, you might find yourself under water...&#10;&#10;"
