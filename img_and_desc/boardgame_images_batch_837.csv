To place cards in your play area, all cards must be placed by ascending order, and cannot be repeated.  You may only put cards with the same color in the same column.  Then you draw the top card from the center pile or a discard pile.&#10;&#10;Each column's card values will be totaled.  The totals will be added together to form the final score.  If a column has no number cards, that column has a score of 0.  If a column has number cards, add up the numbers, then subtract 20.

The gods themselves are depicted crowned with a naja.&#10;&#10;The scarab rolls the sun around to rise each day, and thus ensures renewal and prosperity. As royalty, veritable deities, you send your najas to lay claim to scarabs, ensuring new life for your lineage.&#10;&#10;In the game Naja, players take turns placing cobras on the board trying to surround as many scarabs as possible. But try not to claim bonfires, lest they harm your najas and weaken your reign!&#10;&#10;EQUIPMENT&#10;&#10;This is what you need to play Naja:&#10;&#10;&#10;     9x9 board with a scarab on each cell&#10;     20 white najas (snakes)&#10;     20 black najas (snakes)&#10;     7 bonfires&#10;     40 black baskets&#10;     40 white baskets&#10;&#10;&#10;You can also get the expansion for 3&ndash;4 players:&#10;&#10;&#10;     15 gray najas&#10;     15 purple najas&#10;     30 gray baskets&#10;     30 purple baskets&#10;&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Place the board in the middle of the playing surface. Each player takes all najas and counters of her colour.&#10;&#10;Randomly place 5 or 7 bonfires (not 6) on different spaces of the board, except for the middle space (to avoid symmetric play) and the border spaces (where they pose almost no risk).&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;White starts. Players take turns in clockwise order legally placing a naja of their colour until no legal placement remains, at which point the game ends.&#10;&#10;Najas have 4 segments. Each naja must be placed so that:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All four segments lie on 4 segments of the board.&#10;     They don&rsquo;t overlap.&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more placements are possible.&#10;&#10;Players then claim areas as follows: The player with more naja segments surrounding an enclosed area must claim it by placing a basket of her colour on each space in the area (except for areas with bonfires on them). If two (or more) players tie in claiming an area, it remains unclaimed. The edge of the board is not a wall, so some areas around the edge might remain unclaimed.&#10;&#10;Each claimed scarab is worth +1 point, but each claimed bonfire is worth &minus;3 points (najas don&rsquo;t like fire!). Ties are possible and are OK: Just play again!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The game begins with the overthrow of Major of Brige, and ends in 1918, the end of WW2, when order is brought back to the town and elections take place. The party with the most voters wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is consisted of a main board map (the town of Brige), Personal Board- these boards give information about the party's current stand. Their content is changed along the game as the party is influenced by the player's decisions, and other effects . In addition, there are &quot;Point of Interest&quot; cards that resemble an encounter with a citizen or an event that is happening that requires the party's decision. Whenever a player lands on a Point of Interest, he takes a card from the pile and must act according to the type of event at hand, and organize his position after reading the consequences. The face of the cards is where the information about the event is given, with the available decisions &amp; options at its bottom. On the back of the card is where the decision's effect is shown.&#10;&#10;Along the game, a party may hire citizens that it encounters and turn them into &quot;Agents&quot;. Once this is done, the player places a figure on the board. Agents are the connecting bridge between the players, and allows a party to make contact with other parties. Every agent has its own skill and have specific actions that can be done with them. A Gunman for example, may attack other units on the board, including the party leader that will lose the player's game if is assasinated.&#10;&#10;An important aspect in the game is money.

You use only three colors of cards for a three-player game, four colors for 4p, and five colors for 5p. The game lasts three rounds, and at the start of each round, you reveal a mission card. The game includes three basic missions and two advanced missions. These missions give you targets that you try to achieve during the round, such as having top cards (explained below) that sum to at most 12.&#10;&#10;Gameplay follows standard trick-taking rules. In a trick, players must follow suit when possible, but they can play any card otherwise. Whoever played the last 4 in a round leads to the next trick; if no one played a 4, then whoever wins the trick leads. When you win a trick, you must take the cards in this trick, arrange them by color with the lowest card on top of each color stack, then place these cards on top of other cards that you've won. Thus, over the course of the game, you'll build up to five color stacks (depending on the number of players) as you take cards.&#10;&#10;When the round ends, you compare the top cards on your stack to that round's mission. If the sum of these cards is higher (or lower, depending on the mission) than the depicted number, then you bust for the round and score only 1 point for each 6 you collected. For all those who didn't bust, players score points based on how their sum compares to others. For the advanced missions, as long as a player doesn't bust, they score points based on the sum of their top cards.&#10;&#10;"

(Close to the Mark!), all players want to collect numbers close to what they already have, but not identical numbers.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a scoring sheet and claims a different color from the five colored dice in the game. On a turn, one player rolls all five dice once. Each player must combine the number on their die with the number on any other die, then write this sum in a circle on their scoring sheet that's either their color or the color of the other die they're using. Each scoring sheet has 25 circles in it in a 5x5 grid, with each color appearing five times. When a player writes a sum in a circle that differs from an adjacent circle by exactly one, the player ticks the box between these circles.&#10;&#10;After 25 turns, the game ends. For each row and column of boxes (with the 4x4 grid of boxes being located within the 5x5 grid of circles), the player scores 0, 1, 3, 6, or 10 points for ticking off 0-4 boxes. In addition, the player scores 2 points for 3, 4, 10 and 11 they wrote down and 4 points for each 2 and 12. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"

On your first turn, you place your starting station somewhere on the game board. On each subsequent turn, you place either one or two rails that connect two points on the board; you can place only one rail if you're crossing a river or a mountain ridge with that rail. All of the rails that you place must touch your starting station or connect with other rails in a network that touches your starting station. Thus, each player builds their own network initially, but as soon as those networks connect, you can place rails anywhere off that connected network&#10;&#10;As soon as a player connects all five of their cities in a network, which could happen on another player's turn, the round ends. Whoever has connected all of their cities scores 4 points; each other player scores 0-3 points depending on how many rails they would need to place to connect all of their cities. You then clear the board, shuffle the cards, and play another round. The first player to score 13 or more points wins! The player who can make the best use of the other players' networks is generally victorious.&#10;&#10;Trans Europa &amp; Trans Amerika includes 19 special cards that can be used to provide more variety in gameplay. At the start of a round, reveal one of the cards; the effect of this card applies to all players during this round, perhaps with everyone discarding their rose card and needing to connect only four cities, or having a mountain pass count as only one rail played, or placing three rails on a turn, or revealing two of their cards so that everyone can see where others are going in particular parts of the map.&#10;&#10;"
