Each Hero has his own action table which describes 10 numbered actions that Hero can take &ndash; these correspond to the 1 (ace) &ndash; 10 cards in the deck.  Action are of 4 types: Attack, Defence, Movement or Special.  A King card can be used to have a friendly Hero attack an adjacent enemy Hero. A Queen card can be used to move a friendly Hero 1 or 2 spaces. Black Jack cards can be used for Witty Repartee: A Friendly Hero and an enemy Hero within 2 spaces of each other may neither move nor attack the rest of this turn. Red Jack cards can be used to Taunt:  A Friendly Hero causes an enemy Hero within 2 spaces to want to attack him or her. That Hero can attack no other Heroes the rest of this or next turn.&#10;&#10;First, each player fills their hand to 6 cards. Players then take turns playing 1 card at a time to cause their heroes to: Move, Attack, and Defend. Attack values indicate the range of the attack emanating from that Hero. Movement values indicate how far the Hero will move. A Defence Action will negate an attack just made by an enemy Hero against this hero. Played cards are discarded. &#10;If a player has no cards left, or nothing he wants to do, he may pass. A player who passes may play no other cards this turn except Defence cards. When both players have passed the turn ends. &#10;Heroes may not end their turns in the same space as another hero however, they may move or attack through (past) other Heroes.  &#10; Each hero has 5 Hit Points (HP). Every time a hero gets attacked and does not defend, it loses 1 HP. If a Hero is reduced to zero HP that Hero is knocked out and removed from play&#10;&#10;At the end of turn 12 if both Cap and Bucky are still in play, team CAP wins, otherwise team IRON Wins.&#10;&#10;"

230410,,"A card game for 2 players in which one player represents the West, the other Russia. The premise of the game is that since the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union as a Superpower, Russia has maintained an active war-footing with the West, using every means possible (covert, hacking, criminal, disinformation, hard force, etc.) to subvert and destabilise the Western powers and the new world order. The long term goal is to remain a major player in an illiberal, multi-polar world.&#10;&#10;Players share a common deck. Some cards can be used by both players. Some cards can only be used by one side.&#10;&#10;The game starts in the year 2000 with each turn representing 2 years. The game ends in 2020. There are a total of 11 turns which proceed as follows:&#10;&#10;1.    Players are dealt 7 cards each.&#10;&#10;2.    A player may reveal a spy card to look at his opponent&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;3.    Players can discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.&#10;&#10;4.    A player may discard an economic card to draw 2 cards.&#10;&#10;5.    A player may discard a military card to make his opponent discard a random card&#10;&#10;6.    A player may discard a political card to draw 3 cards and discard 2 cards.&#10;&#10;7.    A player may discard a culture card to gain 1 Victory point.&#10;&#10;8.    Players reveal their hands.&#10;&#10;9.    The player with the highest force total wins the hand.  Every card has a force value but a player can only count cards that match his side or that can be used by both players. A player may only use 1 card of the same type, so for example, he could use one military card toward his total but not two. This is the &ldquo;One-Type-only Rule&rdquo;. If a player reveals a crime card, however, he may break the One-Type-Only Rule, once, unless his opponent plays a law card.&#10;&#10;10.   Discard all cards.&#10;&#10;If any player wins 3 hands in a row, they win the game.  Otherwise the winner of the first turn gets 1 Victory point (VP), the winner of the second turn gets 2 VP, the winner of the third turn gets 3 VP and so on. The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"
