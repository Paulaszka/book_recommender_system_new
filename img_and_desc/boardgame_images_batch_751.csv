In this politically unstable environment, resourceful operatives and courageous secret agents plot to secure power for their rulers. The balance of power shifts back and forth amidst foiled assassinations, successful rebellions, and futile invasions &mdash; and not infrequently, those who sympathize with the weak are expelled from the country.&#10;&#10;The real enemies, then as now, are not the rival religions. The true battle pits those who believe in tolerance and compromise against the tyrants who would impose their ideas on everyone else &mdash; no matter what the cost. Who will best exploit the changing power conditions in Europe to win the game?&#10;&#10;"

To do so, the muse must eliminate their virtuoso's rivals by levying doubts and dreads upon them until they are driven insane...or worse.&#10;&#10;Bemused is not a social deduction game.  Although there are elements of deductive reasoning, Bemused is a social interaction experience that encourages shameless table talk, bluffing, and deal-making as players seek to maximize their scores in a &quot;take that&quot; environment.  Bemused is best described as a strategic &quot;ruin your rivals&quot; game with hidden goals and asymmetric player powers.  It is also a much deeper strategy game than it first appears.&#10;&#10;Each player has a virtuoso card that designates their human prot&eacute;g&eacute; and a hand of doubt and dread cards.  Each turn, the player draws two doubt cards for their hand, places a doubt or dread card from their hand onto a virtuoso card, then discards a card from their hand. In some cases, a player may play two doubt cards from their hand, but this action permanently reduces their hand size. Each virtuoso has an ability that their muse may use, such as change a dread to a doubt or move a doubt from one virtuoso to another.  Scheming, negotiating, and table talk are encouraged!&#10;&#10;When a virtuoso is saddled with a combined total of five doubt and/or dread cards, the virtuoso is driven insane. An insane virtuoso still gets their turn and may still win the game, but their options for which cards they may play on their turn is limited by their insanity. If an insane virtuoso has more dread than doubts, that virtuoso dies and becomes a fantasma that haunts the remaining living virtuosos. A fantasma may still win the game!&#10;&#10;Each muse's prot&eacute;g&eacute; also has a gemina, a secret virtuoso in the game that holds a psychic link with their prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and a secret that describes how their prot&eacute;g&eacute; feels about their gemina, and how the player's score will be affected by the state of their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s gemina when the game ends (e.g., the player may gain points if their virtuoso's gemina is not insane at the end of the game).  Once a virtuoso's gemina is revealed, a player may use the gemina's ability as well as their prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s ability!  A player may also reveal and use their virtuoso's gemina for a price... but whenever a virtuoso goes insane, their gemina automatically flips over and can have severe consequences for play...&#10;&#10;"

However, the Napoleonic magic could not work at such distances (a dispatch sent from Vienna to Madrid, would travel 2,400 km in 12 to 14 days); when dispatches arrived they were often days or weeks out of date.

Now she needs supporting data. But science can be a brutally competitive field.

It may force you to trash the microbes, force microbes from your dish into the petri dishes of others, steal microbes or wipe out a species across the whole table. The BIOTIX are in a constant state of flux throughout the game, as is your score, because at the end of the day you gain points for the BIOTIX remaining in your dish, with the most volatile BIOTIX being worth the most points.&#10;&#10;The best score over 3 days of research determines the winner! Then try the advanced game, with Aggressive BIOTIX, a cancer-like organism that mimics the properties of the BIOTIX they replace in your dish &ndash; except they are worth negative points instead of their usual values.&#10;&#10;"

The more faces they roll, the better they fight the fire. Players can choose to cut firebreaks, which protect tiles from embers blown by wind gusts, or push their luck to reduce flames and possibly even generate reward tokens. If players bust and fail to match at least three of the six symbols on the tile, the fire grows. Another option is to maneuver vehicles &mdash; air tanker, helicopter, and brush rig &mdash; to save the forest.&#10;&#10;Flame tokens are added at the end of each player's turn by the draw of a fire card, which can bring about light or strong wind gusts, increase the strength of the flames on certain tiles, and start fires. Too many flame tokens will cause a tile to scorch and be lost. Losing a terrain tile could also affect the game play. Some tiles are tied to crewmembers' special abilities, while others help the firefighters, and still others cause the fire to spread in unique ways. If eight tiles scorch or the fire camp scorches, the game is over and the forest is lost &mdash; but if the intrepid crew can extinguish the fire, the team wins together.&#10;&#10;The press-your-luck mechanism with ratcheting rewards creates tension, and the variety of ways to fight the fire makes for interesting choices.

Players assume the roll of penguins who slap each other with fish! (Slapping in the sense of playing a card, not physically slapping your opponents or the table) The last penguin holding fish is the winner!&#10;&#10;The game consists of 2 decks of cards, Penguin Personas cards and fish cards. Each player assumes the roll of one of the Penguin Personas cards. These personas are comical and give them special abilities in the game.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different colors (or suits) of fish cards. Red fish contain attack cards, yellow fish are counter-attack cards, blue fish help you draw more cards, and green fish are items and equipment. The fish cards are colored on both sides so you can see what color (or suit) of fish your opponents have, but you don't know exactly what *kinds* of fish they have. (Is that a red SLAP fish, or a red STEAL fish?) Each player also has two randomly-shuffled draw piles to choose from, so they can strategically pick which colored fish to draw depending on what's available.&#10;&#10;Players take turns catching and slapping each other with fish, but have to be careful! Their opponent could counter their slap back to them, increasing it's power! With 4 different colors of fish you can strategically build your hand to defend or attack!&#10;&#10;"

Players take turns either placing one piece on the board or moving an already placed piece; the Witches are the first pieces each player must play. All pieces are initially placed on the outer circle of the board, in any free junction. The game ends when one player cannot move her Witch because it's locked in by her opponents' pieces, or even by her own pieces.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one Witch, three Wolves, two Owls and one Raven. Witches can move up to three junctions (they need not be aligned) and may jump over one piece of its own colour. Wolves move the same way, but only up to two junctions. Owls can only move one junction at a time, and therefore cannot jump over other pieces. Ravens may move any amount of junctions in a continuous line, without jumping over any pieces; the outer circle counts as a continuous line.&#10;&#10;"

These people were given outdated firearms, and were forced to kill one another. There were two reasons for the Government to do this: one was to collect battle data through the experimental battles, and the other was as an easy way to dispose such troublesome people.&#10;&#10;Dokugasu Zangousen is a three-dimensional chess-like board game. In a 7x7 square grid board, you may make a hump (place a cube) or dig an entrenchment (remove a cube) to avoid lines of fire or to hinder enemy's movement. But entrenchment is vulnerable to poison gas which tends to go downward into holes.&#10;&#10;Players initially have two soldiers each. At the beginning of each round, players place two action cards face-down in front of them. Then first player takes all actions they have placed.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you may do two of the following  actions as you have programmed:&#10;1) Move: Move one of your soldiers one square orthogonally, or advance the soldier two squares forward.&#10;&#10;2) Turn: Turn the direction of one of your soldiers.&#10;&#10;3) Construct: Place a cube on a square adjacent to one of your soldiers. Or remove a cube from in front of the soldier.&#10;&#10;4) Fire: Fire a gun from one of your soldiers orthogonally to kill an enemy or destroy a cube. Or throw a bag of poison gas to kill soldiers within an affected area, which is determined by wind direction.&#10;&#10;5) Dig: Dig an entrenchment at the exact square of one of your soldiers.&#10;&#10;6) Item: One of your soldier wears or takes off a gas mask. While wearing the mask, the soldier gains protection from poison but is unable to advance two squares, construct, or move cubes. Or one of your soldier takes a drug for two extra actions.&#10;&#10;7) Camp: Retrieve one or all action cards you have played so far.&#10;&#10;You score one point when you kill one of your enemies, or when you move one of your soldier outside the board across the opponent's border.

Each turn, you roll a die to determine your movement direction and move your pawn, then reveal the area card under your pawn if it is not explored yet.

You may use items you have found for special effects, such as to destroy an impassable area, or to dig deeper than usual. When you reach a big treasure, you score big points and the round is over.&#10;&#10;Play three rounds and the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher:&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#229;&#186;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#156;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#190;&#161;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#167;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#177;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#153;&#186;&#230;&#142;&#152;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#142;&#152;&#229;&#137;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#166;&#168;&#229;&#174;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#230;&#183;&#177;&#233;&#131;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#228;&#184;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#167;&rdquo;Let's DIG&rdquo;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#226;&#150;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;

The Allies must therefore risk attacking these strongly held outposts to clear their main attacks. The villages also give the opportunity to the Franco-Bavarians to use counter-attacks. The French army is no longer the superb weapon of Cond&eacute;, Turenne or Luxembourg: a force hurling itself forward in a furia franchese. It cannot out face the Allies in the open, but by carefully using counter-attacks it can yet confound the Allies.&#10;&#10;The Allies need to balance their attacks along the line to keep the Franco-Bavarians pinned and prevent them moving reserves into areas subject to the main Allied attack. Forces are divided into foot and horse, and these two arms will support each other in combat. Problems arise where foot and horse are not both available. Then infantry can find themselves pinned and shelled, and cavalry unable to attack effectively.&#10;&#10;"

The objective is to reach London by travelling either east or west, with North America at the top connecting to European/African destinations at the bottom.&#10;&#10;The period illustrations are wonderful, including a bust of Lenin in Leningrad (with a train heading back to Germany), Charlie Chaplin being filmed as the little tramp in Hollywood, a cannibal eating a white man in Indonesia, a hookah-smoking Turk, a kilted Scot, an arrogant European waiter, a Dutch girl in clogs and a Spaniard fighting a bull. There also are drawings of all the famous sights, from Niagara Falls, the Taj Mahal and the Pyramids to the Kremlin, Statue of Liberty, Westminster, and a biplane flying over the Eiffel Tower.&#10;&#10;"

Should you obtain another card of that type, you place the new card on top of the other card. The dice ranges from 2-6 with one of the sides showing a &quot;P&quot;. When this side is rolled, the player who rolled it, gets to go to a passage (location space marked with a &quot;P&quot;) of his/her choice. All other players not on a &quot;P&quot; are temporarily removed.

The Pundit then plays a Topic of their choice from their hand and the players must make as many puns as possible by combining. At the end of a round the Pundit awards the Scenario card as a point to whoever made the best, worst or most puns. The game ends when a player reaches 10 points. &#10;At any point in a game, if a player makes a pun that causes everyone to cringe they can be awarded a Cringe card as a reward.
