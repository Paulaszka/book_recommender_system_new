The system emphasizes the limits of command, training, and discipline, all in the milieu of the very linear style of warfare in the pre-Napoleonic era. In addition, it uses a most unusual set of mechanisms for resolving shock combat. Will you have your troops go into close order, or spread out for better fire possibilities? What are the pros and cons of the rifle-armed American militia? Can your dragoon forces exert any influence?&#10;&#10;Flintlock is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, but they cover almost every aspect of battle at this micro level. Playing time is less than 2 hours.&#10;&#10;The battles chosen highlight small unit tactics in the grueling Southern Campaign, where both sides had ample opportunities to watch, learn and practice, with an emphasis on formation. Some of the great commanders of the war, from Nathanial Greene and Daniel Morgan to Lord Cornwallis and the infamous, but capable, Banastre Tarleton are in full action.&#10;&#10;The Scenarios/battles, all (well, most) with armies of one or two thousand men, include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Camden (17 August 1780)  where Lord Cornwallis stood and confronted a much larger force under Horatio Gates, but the rebel militia disintegrated and Gates&rsquo;s army was routed in a major British victory. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Cowpens (17 January 1781). Daniel Morgan conducted a masterful, tactical battle, defeating Banastre Tarleton and destroying the dreaded British Legion in one of the major victories of the war.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Guilford Courthouse (15 March 1781). Nathanial Greene outnumbered Lord Cornwallis by more than two to one. However, the British took the field but with such heavy losses that, in retrospect, Greene could claim a strategic success.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hobkirk&rsquo;s Hill (25 April 1781) in which Nathanial Greene&rsquo;s Marylanders failed to stand against a concerted charge from Lord Rawdon&rsquo;s smaller but better disciplined army. &#10;&#10;&#10;"

It is played on a 10x10-square checker board with 20 pieces per player. This game is popular in European countries like France, The Netherlands, Russia, Poland and Belgium and in African nations like Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast. However, there are countries outside these two continents that boast of good players like in the United States, Italy, Israel and Brazil.&#10;&#10;Rules of the Game: This game is played on a 10x10, or 100 squares checker board where the double corner is on the right of each player.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the Men: Checkers pieces (the Men) can move forward on each empty square to the left or to the right. When these pieces reach the last line on the opponent's side they become Kings.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the King: Kinged pieces can move across multiple squares on the two diagonals that cross their position for so long as these squares are open, in a rule known as the &quot;Flying Kings&quot;.&#10;&#10;Captures: In International Checkers, maximum captures are obligatory, which means that if a player has more than one path to jump to capture his opponent's pieces, they must take the path that will effect the most captures of their opponent's pieces. If a piece lands on the King row during a jump, it must continue jumping backward for as long as there is a jump opportunity. That particular piece cannot be Kinged unless it finishes the move and stops on King row.&#10;&#10;Captures by the Men: Men can effect a capture by moving forward or backward while jumping over a single piece of the opponent provided that the said piece is adjacent to it and the following square is empty. If the Man can jump again from the arrival square to effect another capture, then it must do so.&#10;&#10;Captures by a King: A Kinged piece can capture an opponent's piece if it is on the same diagonal where it is positioned provided that the squares between them are empty and that the square beyond the piece to be captured is also empty. The King can stop on any square within the same diagonal line and if another capture can be effected from any of these squares, then it must continue to do so.&#10;&#10;The Winning Player: The player who cannot move any of their pieces loses the game.&#10;&#10;Conditions for a Draw:&#10;&#10;     By mutual agreement of the players.&#10;     Both players have played five moves, after a position arises of one King against two pieces, which includes a King.&#10;     Both players have played sixteen moves, after a position arises of one King against three pieces, which includes a King.&#10;     Both players have moved twenty five moves solely with Kings and not a single piece was captured.&#10;     For the third time the same position arises with the same player at move.&#10;&#10;&#10;Information from checkershistory.com (now defunct)&#10;&#10;Online Play/Apps links can be found in the Community Wiki at the end of the page.&#10;&#10;"

The island has fascinated travelers, mystics, and scientists for years as people have wondered how such a small, isolated area could have been home to a society that created the world's most spectacular outdoor museum. In the 1940s, Norwegian archeologist Thor Heyerdahl sailed the reed boat Kon-Tiki from South America to Easter Island to show that the technology available made it possible for Polynesia to be settled from the Americas. In the 1970s, Erich Van Daniken popularized the idea that the world was visited by ancient astronauts and the beautiful and enormous stone statutes, the Moai, of Easter Island were used as some of his &quot;evidence.&quot;&#10;&#10;Today, scientists around the world generally agree that Easter Island was settled from other Polynesian islands to its west, and the extreme culture that produced hundreds of stone Moai is related to other cultures in the region. The history of the island is a history of constraint, and the carving of the Moai, the rapid deforestation of the island, and the limited food sources available all worked together to build an extreme culture that became the victim of its own consumption. In this way, Easter Island today represents more than just a wonderful place to travel, but also is a reminder of the greater resource limits of our entire planet. As populations continue to grow and we put further strains on sources of fuel and food, are we heading toward the same fate that this small island suffered hundreds of years ago? The island today is owned by Chile, and the small population thrives with a few weekly flights to mainland South America and the occasional cargo ship visit.&#10;&#10;Moai is a game that closely follows the developments and excesses of the island until the arrival of Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to discover the island and name it for the day of his discovery. Combining many of the historical features of the island's culture in an exciting and well-playing strategic game, players can have fun reliving the dramatic history of this exciting little island.&#10;&#10;"

The new leader in Moscow has declared no more will Soviet tanks prop up tottering Communist governments. The economies, after decades of central planning and stagnation, have reached various stages of crisis. Inside the churches and among the students and their professors there are dissident movements that have been emboldened. From crushing dissent to offering concessions, the Communist player will have to use a variety of strategies in a struggle to hold on to his empire.&#10;&#10;&quot;A bad regime is never in so great danger as when it tries to improve.&quot; - Alexis de Tocqueville&#10;&#10;The other player plays the Democrat. At the dawn of 1989, behind the iron curtain, no one considers revolution possible. The goal of dissidents is to create a civil society outside the control of the Communist regimes. On their side are students who are fascinated with the style and pop culture of the west, and the Church. Against them is the vast apparatus of the Communist state. Their challenge is to persuade the workers, who are the bulk of society, to join their cause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.

The Germans hoped to take Russia out of the war, but they never dreamed how much the world would change.&#10;&#10;Now, Against the Odds lets you explore the tangled facets of the Russian Civil War, with the historical situation exemplified by a game that handles two to four players&hellip;with up to three of them commanding the &ldquo;White&rdquo; Russian factions! (In multi-player games, if the Reds are defeated, the game isn&rsquo;t over yet!) For Bloody Honor: Civil War Russkaya captures the interactions of political influence, railways, foreign intervention, and the discord among the White factions that gave the Bolsheviks their best chance to win in a battle against &mdash; as it seemed to them &mdash; their internal enemies and the whole Western Alliance. (Yes, there were British, French, Canadian, Australian, Indian, Japanese, and even U.S. troops fighting in Russia as late as 1920&hellip;and even later for the Japanese).&#10;&#10;For Bloody Honor includes 10 game turns, each representing 4 months of real time from the end of 1918 to the end of 1921, and driven by chit pull which will guarantee no two turns are alike. Units represent organized troops of various sizes, with each counter (except tanks) of relatively equal strength. Yes, depending on the situations, this can become a &ldquo;buckets of dice&rdquo; game&hellip;or the fate of a region (and the political points that go with it) may hinge on a single unit. Defeat can be costly, not only in lost units but in the potential for defecting as your units may decide the other side has more to offer them!&#10;&#10;Can you, as the Reds, repeat history and form a Union of Soviet Socialists Republics?

Technology (tanks, aircraft) is important but it alone cannot win the game. The beautiful area map conveys at a glance the massive expanses of the war, for each area plays a critical political role. The game is deceptively simple to learn, yet, like Chess, hard to master. A grand strategic game on the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922, with each turn being four months, units represent 5 - 15,000 men, while tanks, aircraft, armor cars and armor trains are abstracted amounts. One player plays the Red , the other plays the White Factions (Polish, Kolchak, Denikin etc). The map is divided into zones. The game, designed by Mark Woloshen, designed a game that is used frequently by his students to learn about the complexities of the RCW. Thus, it is focused on how the political influence and control impacted the military events. One cannot win by military means alone. The game relies on activations and recruiting new men to man the armies is of major importance subject the game's political realities!
