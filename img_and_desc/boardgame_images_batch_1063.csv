More specifically, he had to defeat his continental enemies in order to secure his continued power. Britain, Russia and Austria were allied against him and, since he couldn&rsquo;t get at the British on their island fortress, and Russia was too far away to allow for the required quick victory, he was left with invading Austria.&#10;&#10;Rapidly surrounding and capturing the main Austrian Army at Ulm, December found Napoleon at Austerlitz (modern day Skavkov u Brna) in southern Moravia at the end of a very stretched supply line. He also appeared to be slightly outnumbered by an Coalition army made up of the remnants of Austrian forces, plus a sizable Russian contingent. Feigning weakness, Napoleon lured the Coalition force into attacking his right flank (where he wanted them to), then counterpunched through the Coalition center to encircle most of them. The Coalition were crushed, and through the victory, Napoleon cemented his hold on the throne. It was a crowning glory.&#10;&#10;This two-player grand-tactical simulation by Ty Bomba presents the battle generally considered to have been Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory.

Both players have a set of 12 pieces; spears, archers, shields, cavalry, longship, infantry, and a castle to protect. The players take turns rolling a die numbered 1-3, and move their pieces accordingly. The first to capture their opponents castle is the winner.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Any lace can be moved by either player, but it must be moved the exact number of spaces rolled, then threaded through an empty hole. When you're unable to complete your turn, you lose. And so, the goal is to maneuver the laces to limit your opponent's options &mdash; but should they escape, they might just hand your crafty trap back to you.&#10;&#10;This is a simple, strange, and sprightly little game that takes only a minute to learn. There's something soothing about the sound of the shoelace sliding against the board as you pull it through. And there's something gently nerve-wracking as the holes get fewer and fewer and the laces start to get shorter and shorter. Each match results in a unique and visually appealing crisscross of blue and pink laces. Every lace has a knot carefully tied at one end by hand &mdash; by either designer Amabel Holland, publisher Mary Holland, or one of our friends.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Cheating is explicitly authorized in the rules, but with penalties for being caught. There are no face cards in the game. The cards of the four suits are ranked in value from 2 to 13 plus a Pyramid card.

In addition, the cards shown in the BGG entry currently described (without attribution) as the &quot;Official Version&quot; of Pyramid appear to use the same artwork as this set, but that deck has 56 cards, with four Cylons and no Death Card.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;There are thousands of forms of Poker through out (sic) the galaxy.

You, the player, will be in command of a two crew midget submarine Type XXVIIB called &ldquo;Seehund&rdquo; (Harbor Seal; plural &ldquo;Seehunde, die&rdquo;) or simply &ldquo;Hund&rdquo; (Hound) by its crews. Equipped with two G7e Torpedoes, the Seehund was designed as a short range commerce raider for deployment in the North Sea.&#10;&#10;The game play is divided into two games, which are connected to each other. You will start with the Strategic Game, which is played on a geographic map of the British Channel and it surrounding coasts. Here you will be at risk of encountering different events and challenges while searching for&#10;convoys to attack. Once you find a convoy, the Strategic Game pauses, and you switch to the Tactical Game, which is played on a large map, which is centered around the encountered convoy. You will try to maneuver as close a possible to identify the individual vessels&#10;and pick the biggest fish. For torpedo simulation, the game uses a simplified mechanism, which allows you to attack from any angle and any range with minimal restrictions. Once there is no more to achieve against this convoy, you will try to escape the scene by grounding your submarine on the seafloor and hoping for the best.&#10;&#10;After your escape, play will continue with the Strategic Game, where you can now choose to continue your journey, or head back to the home harbor of IJmuiden. Once you reach harbor, the game comes to a happy ending. But don&rsquo;t be fooled, as there is only one happy end, and a dozen ways to die in the cold waters of the North Sea.&#10;&#10;"

The players draft their fishes in 2 phases of the game, each consisting of 8 rounds. At the end of the game, each player has a 4 x 4 tableau of multicoloured fish in front of them.

Your goal is to place cards controlled by you (servants)on selected locations and gain points. But the trail vanishes in your steps, so it&acute;s up to you, if you&acute;re willing to sacrifice your servants by placing them on those doomed places.&#10;&#10;There are 4 actions in player&acute;s turn: &#10;&#10;     Send - You&rsquo;ll start every turn with 5 Minions in your hand. When you take a Send action, choose one of them and place it below the leftmost card of the trail. Mark it with a token in your color.&#10;     Travel - With a Travel action, you advance one Minion along the trail to the right. Your Minion can take a number of steps indicated by its speed &#10;     Fight - With a Fight action, you can attempt to slay or turn an opponent&rsquo;s Minion. Choose one of your Minions at that same location. Your Minion is the attacker and your opponent&rsquo;s Minion is the defender. Specify whether you will fight with strength or willpower.&#10;     Conjure - Each location along the Hollow Trail holds magical power that can be unleashed by those who know its secrets. To take a Conjure action, your Minion and its location must have a matching type. This type determines the type of spell you can Conjure.&#10;&#10;&#10;Contests&#10;Hollow trail is a positional game. To score, you need to send your Minions to a particular location. The locations that allow players to compete for points are called Contests. The Contests are not resolved until the scoring phase (every 4 rounds) so it&rsquo;s not enough to gain the dominant position &ndash; you must hold it.&#10;&#10;Scoring phase&#10;After each set of 4 rounds, there is a scoring phase, as indicated by the timing track along the top of the scoreboard. The following things happen in this order:&#10;1. Guardians attack. Resolve Guardians from left to right.&#10;In the example below, the Guardian attacks the location to its left, turning the red Minion into a Lost Minion.&#10;2. Score locations from left to right. &#10;In the example below, the red and blue players are tied at the first location, so each gets 2 points. No one gets points at the second location. The red player could have scored 5 points at the third location, but red&rsquo;s Minion was turned, so no one scores. Both players at the Campsite score 1 point.&#10;3. Old trail vanishes! Remove the first three locations and all Minions there. Cards go to their respective discard piles. Slide all remaining cards left.&#10;4. If any of the remaining locations is still face down, turn it face up. Guardians revealed this way do not attack, but give Guardians and Obstacles their resistance tokens and replacement-option cards, as usual.&#10;5. New trail appears. Shuffle the deck corresponding to the next part of the game and deal out 3 new locations face down.&#10; At the ends of part I and part II, the first three locations in the trail are removed. The Minions at those locations have a chance to glean magical essence for their players, but they don&rsquo;t survive to the next part of the game. In general, it&rsquo;s a good idea to get at least one Minion to the second half of the trail so you aren&rsquo;t starting the next part of the game with nothing.&#10;6. The leftmost card of the trail must not be an Obstacle or a Guardian. If it is, replace it with a random Contest from the same deck.&#10;7. All players may now discard any number of Minions from their hands and draw back to a full hand of 5. In this case, all cards must be drawn randomly from the deck.&#10;8. Advance the round counter and determine a new starting player. The player in the worst position gets to go last. This means the starting player is the player to the left of the one with the fewest points. If players are tied for fewest points, the one with fewer Minions is worse off. If there is still a tie, break it randomly.&#10;&#10;"

The players are representatives of the Galactic Council, sent to Earth to build space stations to observe and perhaps interact with humanity.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with nine ships and a station hub. These ships act as action spaces that players use to gather resources, explore the nearby planets, and build their stations. Turns are fast and straightforward; either take ship action or take income.&#10;&#10;Many games start players off with a small resource engine which they build up to a bigger one. In Space Station Phoenix, players start with the best production engine they will ever have and proceed to break it down part by part. As the game progresses, their actions get more efficient, but the number of ways to take those actions starts to diminish.&#10;&#10;Space Station Phoenix also features deep re-playability with millions of possible starting positions and station parts combinations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

One queue is open to begin the game, others open randomly and as many as 4 can be open at once.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with 8-10 number cards and a devil card which they can use to create havoc by stealing a card from another player or by blocking an open queue. Any player who doesn't have a number card to play in a sequence during their turn must lay down their cards for all to see and draw at least one card from the bank. That's when the skullduggery and the scheming begins.&#10;&#10;Any player who plays a rare red number card into a queue earns a blind draw from a treasure trove of wild cards, devil cards and Q-cards which they can use to open new queues. First out wins and cards held by losing players count against them.&#10;&#10;One more thing. In poker a player with a bad hand can fold.

Each symbol has a different effect, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins (for solo, the goal is to earn the most points). The game has light area control strategies, and generally rewards capturing many of the same kind of symbol.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players build a tableau of three cards in three columns (similar to games like Battle Line). Likewise, players are building scoring combos to claim the different keys as prizes.&#10;&#10;The deck has 35 cards, from 1 to 7 in five colours.&#10;&#10;Each round, 3 fresh keys are drawn from a bag and placed as a line between the players. The deck is shuffled, and five cards are dealt face-up alongside the keys. Each player is dealt three hand cards, and gets a player aid showing the possible combos.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player draws a card and then plays a card to the tableau, or discards and pulls a face-up card to the tableau instead. Whenever a player completes a column on three cards, they draw one more card and discard from their hand.&#10;&#10;Cards can be played face-down to a column. A player can discard two cards, and use a discard from the other players side instead.&#10;&#10;When the three keys have three cards set on both sides, any face-down cards are turned up. Equal combos do not get a key, otherwise the winning combo claims a key.&#10;&#10;The deck is shuffled over for the next round and fresh keys are pulled from the bag to make up the line.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player wins enough keys.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"
