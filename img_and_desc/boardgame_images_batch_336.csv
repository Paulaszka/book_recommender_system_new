The Roman Empire has collapsed and a new power, the Byzantine Empire, has just begun its 1000 year history in Constantinople. The West clamors for goods from the East: Silk and Paper from China; Resins and Emeralds from Arabia; Wheat, Glass, Linen and Ivory from Egypt and Spices (pepper, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, etc), Dyes, Gums, Mordants and Incense from India.&#10;&#10;Amber, Gold and Silver, along with many crafted manufactures, flow from and through the major trading cities of Constantinople and Istakhr to the people of the East.&#10;&#10;As the head of a trading family, you wish to extend your influence and gain interest in the great Trading Families through the marriage of your children and grandchildren into those families. Great gifts are expected with each marriage, but you expect to gain from each new alliance with other families through your shared profits.&#10;&#10;As new trade routes are established, profits are made and paid. The marriage price you pay to acquire an interest in another Trading Family should not be too low, or they will not have the financial resources to grow fruitfully. Paying too much is wasteful and diminishes your own personal fortune. We would wish you luck here, but there is no luck in this game. Instead, we wish you wisdom and skill in this age of scheme, spreading your influence and gaining wealth in creating and expanding these Routes To Riches.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Samarkand: Routes to Riches (released in February 2010)&#10;&#10;&#10;"

In a game format that resembles the well-known Monopoly&trade;, players roll dice to move across a board filled with potential downfalls related to family, health, friendships, finances and self-esteem, which are described on game cards that players draw.  The objective of the game is to stay alive, without losing all social and financial resources due to substance abuse -- a task that becomes more challenging the longer the player stays in the game.&#10;&#10;The Downward Spiral game focuses on the consequences of substance abuse on a person&rsquo;s family, finances, self-esteem, health, legal status, and life expectancy (or lack thereof).  Each player takes the role of a person who continues to abuse drugs throughout his/her lifetime.  The last player left &ldquo;alive&rdquo; in the game &ldquo;wins.&rdquo;  The game uses vignettes as well as facts and quotes to emphasize the consequences amassed in the game.
