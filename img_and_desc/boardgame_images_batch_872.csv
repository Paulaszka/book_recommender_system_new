During game play, players will take turns placing item cards on  a 5 x 5 grid. Players will also have  secret guide showing anywhere from 1-5 points for each spot on the grid. The player earns points for every preferred item card placed and loses points when their least favorite cat&rsquo;s items are on the grid. Each player has a different guide, meaning each player can gain or lose points for different spots.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Types of Cards:&#10;Cat Identity: Each player gets 2 of these. Keep them secret. &#10;Grid Goal: Each player gets 1 of these. Also keep this secret.&#10;Cat Items: Players will get a lot of these throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Set Up: &#10;To start the game , first distribute the starting grid cards face up on the table, revealing 25 colorful spaces where players can play item cards. Then shuffle and give each player 2 Cat Identity cards, 1 Grid Goal card, and 5 Item cards. Play will start with the person who has the most cats. If there is a tie then rock paper scissors should suffice. Players DO NOT select a favorite and least favorite cat at this time.&#10;&#10;During the beginning stages of the game, players will take turns drawing 1 item from the items deck and playing 1 item within the 5 x 5 grid, not placing any cards on top of existing Item cards within the grid. &#10;They also must place cards at least 2 spaces from the last card played if able.&#10;&#10;When they place an Item card on the grid, that player will also place the token to show the last played Item card. If there are no spaces available 2 spaces from the last card played then place anywhere an Item card has not been placed. Once 25 item cards are placed on top of all starting grid cards, players must select their favorite cats by placing it face down in front of them and adjacent to the 5 x 5 grid. The cat card left in their hand is their least favorite cat. Remember that if both are the same then they do not have a least favorite cat.&#10;&#10;How to play: &#10;At this time shuffle the remaining item deck and deal each player 10 additional item cards in order to build individual decks. From this point forward, players will draw and play from their individual decks. Players will continue to draw 1 item card and place 1 item card on top of existing item cards until all players have no cards left in their individual item decks. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be stacked on top of other cards.&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t forget: Players can only place item cards 2 or more spaces from the last played item card.&#10;&#10;End of Game: &#10;After all item cards have been played from the players&rsquo; individual decks, players will reveal their favorite cats and calculate their points based on their secret grid card, giving positive points for each item of the cat on the grid. Players will then reveal their least favorite cat and referring to their goal grid card, deduct points from their total for each item on the grid from their least favorite cat. The player with the highest total points wins.&#10;&#10;Single Player Variant:&#10;In the single player variant of Rainbow Cats, you will shuffle all 140 cards and make a 5 x 5 grid with 5 item cards in each space. The remaining cards will become your deck. You will then shuffle your deck and deal yourself 5 cards. Next, you will shuffle and deal yourself two cat cards.&#10;&#10;Unlike the multi-player version, you cannot have the same favorite and least favorite cat and will need to draw another cat card.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is to remove all 20 items for the favorite cat. You remove 2 items from anywhere on the grid as long as they belong to same cat. The only items you cannot remove are from your least favorite cat. You can also peak at as many item cards on the grid as you&rsquo;d like to help plan where you want  which cards to move. You can however move any item card from 1 space to another when you collect 2 of your favorite cat&rsquo;s items.&#10;&#10;For example, if Phoenix is your favorite cat and there are 2 red items for Phoenix showing, you will remove those 2 items and the items make a pair. When you remove a pair of items from your favorite cat, you can also move . Cards in hand can also be used. When cards in hand are played, it is replaced with a card from the remaining deck. The goal is to get all 20 items for your favorite cat.&#10;&#10;"

Little did they realize the great calamity about to enter their lives, as outside the gates was a wolf, Ivar the Boneless (son of Ragnar). Standing over seven foot tall, a great warrior and military tactician but also a tyrant, Ivar was the cruel and ruthless leader of the mycel heathern here, or Great Heathen Army.&#10;&#10;Ivar, with his brothers Ubbe &amp; Halfdan, along with their army arrived from Ireland years earlier. After landing in East Anglia in 865 AD they demanded and received Danegeld in the form of horses and supplies from King Edmund and the East Angles. The Vikings now had mobility by land and sea. Their target was Northumbria, and the domination of this northern kingdom with its superior river and road networks that linked Yorvic and Dublin to the Scandinavian homeland.&#10;&#10;Northumbria in 866 was in a state of savage civil war. Osberht, the rightful King of Northumbria, had been deposed by Aella and a battle for control of Northumbria raged. Into this vacuum entered Ivar and his army. Chaos reigned as Ivar and the Viking Hordes began to launch attacks throughout Deira, looting, pillaging and killing in what could only have been a strategic plan by Ivar to weaken, subdue, cower, and splinter his enemies.&#10;&#10;By March of 866 The rival Northumbrian Kings had reached a tacit agreement to stop their civil war to march on the Vikings and take back their kingdom. Although weakened by civil war, it also meant that the warriors of these Saxon lands were battle hardened, well trained and in such numbers that a full frontal assault against the Vikings at Yorvic was planned. For a short period it looked like Saxon success was theirs&rsquo; for the taking. But Ivar had arranged his defenses with all the cunning of an Alpha Wolf and the Saxons were defeated and King Alle would suffer the gruesome Ritual of the Blood Eagle.&#10;&#10;Ivar the Boneless is as much a strategic as tactical game. While there will be pitched battles both players will have to make decisions as to when and where to fight, and how best to maximize your strengths, whether Viking or Saxon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

277808,,"Macau-Wars Variation&#10;&#10;Macau Wars It&rsquo;s a major game variation of the Macau card game based on the Macau (card game) Macau Plawno Variation, still being in development on github.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;2 or more players are dealt 5 cards each; after that, the top card from the deck is then placed on the table. Play starts to the dealer's right.&#10;&#10;The next card played must be of the same suit or the same value as the card on the table. For example, If a 7 of spades was on the table, the player can play a 9 of spades or a 7 of clubs or any other card that matches 7 or spades. If the player cannot play a card, he must draw from the deck.&#10;&#10;Cards cannot be played in runs, i.e. 5 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs but a minimum of two or more the same value cards can be played.&#10;&#10;When an action card is played, the player next (or previous depend on the action card) in the sequence must complete the action or add to it to pass it onto the next player in sequence. When down to a single card, a player must say &quot;Macau!&quot;. If a player forgets to call &quot;Macau&quot; before the next players move, the player must draw 5 cards. The winner of the game is the first player to have no cards; in instances of more than 2 players, gameplay continues until only one player is left with cards. In case of Macau Championships once the first player to have no cards wins and the game stops. The winner shuffles the cards and the new game starts. One point is then assigned to the winner.&#10;&#10;For the avoidance of doubt: If the player plays King of Spades and King of Hearts with King of Hearts on top the next player will pick up 5 cards as the top card takes precedence in this case.&#10;&#10;War&#10;&#10;In this game, a scenario called a war and deception can be created when players consecutively play 'special cards' to make other players increase their card count.&#10;&#10;War is started when 2, 3, King of Spades (to a previous player) or King of Hearts is played. Causing players to pick up cards. When a war starts, players can play any 2s and 3s as the suit and value are being ignored during the war. Players can also play King of Spades and King of Hearts regardless of the suit currently on the deck and value of the cards as long as they are 2, 3 or mentioned Kings. Queen of Hearts can be played anytime during the war to stop the war causing the player to not pick up any cards. In this variation of the game, players can often pick up as many as 20 cards (they all add up, e.g. 2+3+2+King of Spades+King of Heart=17).&#10;&#10;When King of Spades is played the previous player must pick up 5 cards or play another action card (any 2, 3, King of Hearts, King of Spades (to a previous player)). After the previous player, the game goes back to the player who played King of Spades.&#10;&#10;Any queen can be placed at any time on any war card regardless of the current suit. See below section for the action of each Queen.&#10;&#10;Action Cards&#10;&#10;2, 3, King of Spades, King of Hearts - War cards that cause players to pick up cards (2,3,5 respectively).&#10;&#10;If a Jack or Ace is played, the player placing the Jack or Ace can call for a non-action card value (in case of Jack) or a suit (in case of Ace). The difference is that the suit is ignored and any Jack can be placed on any Ace, and any Ace can be placed on any Jack, therefore, ignoring the requested suit or value of the previous player.&#10;&#10;Queen of hearts - stops the war and causes the player not to pick up any cards.&#10;&#10;Queen of diamonds - the next person is skipped (also during the war).&#10;&#10;Queen of spades - order of play switches directions (also during the war).&#10;&#10;Queen of clubs - player can chose who play next (cannot chose her/himself) (also during the war).&#10;&#10;If a 4 is played the deception part starts, and all the players must miss a go, unless they have a 4 (if they don't have a 4 or they chose not to play the 4, they don't pick a card from the deck), in which case they can add this to the original 4, and all players in sequence must miss a go, unless someone has a 4, in which case they can add this to the original 4 and so on. If no one else has a 4 then the last player, who put 4 plays as many times as there are 4s. For example, if there are four 4s after the last player played the 4, the player must play four times. Note: the last player will play four times against him/herself, that also include all the action cards which will apply to the player him/herself. The deception is when someone doesn't want to play a 4 but has it and can play a 4 after everyone said they don't/have a 4 causing this player to have more turns.&#10;&#10;Joker replaces any card.&#10;&#10;Open Cards&#10;&#10;The more difficult version of Macau Wars (and any Macau variation) is a game played with open cards. That means that all the players cards and the draw deck is shown. This is similar to Chess where by knowing all the cards players must think about strategy and future moves. Open cards variation might take hours to finish.&#10;&#10;"

Each of the six piece types moves differently. An additional piece which is not present at the beginning of the game, is the noble. The noble piece replaces any infantry unit that makes it to the opposing player&rsquo;s side of the board and moves in the exact same fashion as the king. The objective is to 'Aboleo' or abolish the opponent's nobility by executing three attacks resulting in the &ldquo;death&rdquo; of the piece. If the king is killed and no other nobility exists, the game is ended. If a noble exists, that piece is then promoted to king and game play continues. This is called a &ldquo;coronation&rdquo;. If more than one noble exists, the player has the option of choosing which piece is promoted to king.&#10;&#10;To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and kill the opponent's pieces, while supporting their own. In addition to Aboleo, the game can be won by voluntary resignation by the opponent, this would typically occur when too many forces have been lost, or if the player feels that the death of his nobility is unavoidable.
