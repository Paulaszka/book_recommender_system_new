The pitch is enclosed (so you don't have to keep picking the ball up from the floor). There are three indentations on the play area and each player has three levers behind their goal.&#10;During play, the ball will always settle into one of these indentations. Then both players try to be first to press the correct lever and thus propel the ball out of its resting place.&#10;After a pre-set time, the player who scores the most goals wins.&#10;&#10;"

This game opposes two swarms of bees that fight for a 91-hexagon beehive. The player's pieces and their movements are: a queen (one hex in any direction), drones (jump over adjacent hexes), adult workers (any number of hexes in any direction, no jumps allowed), young workers (one hex forward). If a young worker reaches one of the 5 &#10;opponent&rsquo;s pollen hexes she is promoted to an adult worker. If a bee finds an opponent&rsquo;s bee in one of the hexes where she could arrive, she can kill her. When a queen is threatened by an opponent&rsquo;s bee and she cannot escape to a safe hex nor she cannot protect herself with another bee, the player loses the game.&#10;&#10;Our word &quot;centre&quot; is a word that we have inherited from Ancient Greek. The greeks called kentron the centre of a circumference, because kentron was the compass needle. But the primitive meaning of kentron was the insect sting. Kentron also meant &quot;the spike of the spear&quot;, and this is the name that this chess-like game recieves.&#10;&#10;"

In the first one &quot;Henry II&quot; - Silesian and German forces  face the Mongol army alone. In the second and third scenarios - the succor of Czech forces in included, therefore they may be more difficult for the Mongol side.&#10;&#10;The goal of each side is to eliminate all leaders of the opponent - or to score more points if this can't be done (points are scored for each leader, destroyed unit or captured standard).&#10;&#10;This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:&#10;&#10;1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)&#10;2. Cavalry of player A attacks&#10;3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)&#10;4. Infantry of player A attacks&#10;5. Player B moves cavalry etc.&#10;&#10;Movement is modified according to tables. Battles are determined by comparing unit strength (with modifiers) in tables and rolling dice. Interesting elements of game mechanics include: fatigue of units, morale (measured on a two-sided track, it works sort of like pulling a rope) and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).&#10;&#10;The game includes: one paper board (made of two parts that should be duct-taped together or glued), chits with units (punchable) and additional chits (for marking &quot;charge&quot;, &quot;fatigue&quot; modifiers) that need to be cut out.&#10;&#10;This game uses the &quot;Medieval&quot; system of &quot;Taktyka i Strategia&quot;, implemented also in Grunwald 1410 - revised and updated.

At the end of a round, the one who has less tricks than the Tiger will be preyed by the Tiger.&#10;&#10;&#236;&#152;&#155;&#235;&#130;&#160; &#236;&#152;&#155;&#236;&#160;&#129;&#236;&#151;&#144;, &#235;&#150;&#161;

ABACAN is a fun new strategy game that uses simple rules to provide a depth of strategy that grows with the experience of the players. ABACAN is a variation of the nearly 3000 year old Chinese mathematical game of Nim. To play, players alternate turns sliding 1,2, or 3 beads on the same bar from one side of the game to the other. The winner is the player who forces their opponent to move the last bead. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, not ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, ABACAN is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again. Great gift item!&#10;&#10;"

Players must select cards carefully, however, as end-game bonuses are awarded for holding certain cards and each card selected opens up new plays for opposing players:  in some cases, marrying a Lord a-Leaping to a Maid a-Milking may be the best play; in others, capturing the Partridge in a Pear Tree may be best.&#10;&#10;The artwork for this game comes from the &quot;12 Days of Christmas&quot; stamps issued by Christmas Island in 1977.  These lovely stamps have been a favorite of philatelists and graphic artists since their issue and add to the theme and flavor of this game.&#10;&#10;"

Dikes are built and wind driven drainage mills pump the seawater out, leaving new usable land behind. Players drain water to create land and then settle farms, villages and cities, and build prestige buildings. The player who best develops their polders and gains the most victory points will win the game. Polders is a 2-4 player game lasting about 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Needed to Play:&#10;&bull; The deck of 76 cards&#10;&bull; 1 Starting Player token to keep track of who goes first each round&#10;&bull; 1 Role pawn, 1 Score Track and 1 Score Track Marker for each player in a matching color&#10;&bull; 2 sets of 35 double sided tiles used to designate mills, farms, villages and cities (called settlements) in the game&#10;&bull; 40 to 50 other people markers in one color, preferably black. These markers are used to designate mills, farmers, villagers and merchants in the game&#10;&#10;Play: Each game round has 3 phases:&#10;&#10;Phase 1 - Role Choice&#10;Beginning with the start player, each player places their role pawn on one of the 5 double-sided Role cards, claiming 1 of the 2 roles on the card. Players can place pawns only on Role cards that do not have a pawn already on them.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 - Polder Drainage&#10;Beginning with the start player, each player, in turn, clockwise from the start player, may do only one of the following actions:&#10;a. Place a new Polder card and Mill marker in their holding&#10;b. Drain all Polders one level&#10;&#10;Phase 3 - Development&#10;Players place markers and score any victory points at this time, per role actions. Players may only place one type of settlement (Farm, Village or City) tile on any one Polder card. Players may never place a settlement tile on a card already developed as a Grist Mill. Prestige Buildings may be claimed by players who have chosen the Banker, Mayor and Merchant roles during this round.&#10;&#10;Certain Prestige Buildings, once claimed by a player, give additional bonuses to role actions:&#10;&#10;Armory: The player may place one additional merchant when choosing the Merchant role. May be to a different city.&#10;Bookshop: The player may move one additional farmer to either a village or city when choosing the Scholar role. May be from a different farm.&#10;City Gate: The player may place one additional villager when choosing the Villager role. May be in a different village.&#10;Church: The player may move one additional merchant to a village or villager to a city when claiming the Clergyman role. May be to a different village or city.&#10;Pasture: The player may place one additional farmer when choosing the Farmer role. May be to a different farm.&#10;&#10;Win: &#10;1. Score the largest Farm by counting each player&rsquo;s largest number of adjacent Farm settlement tiles and multiply by 2 for the VP score. Each farmer on every Farm settlement adds additional 1VP.&#10;2. Score 1VP for each villager on a Village settlement tile adjacent to a Grist Mill. Grist Mills may share Villages.&#10;3. Each player scores 1VP for each City settlement tile and 1 VP for each merchant in their City settlements.&#10;4. Subtract 1VP for each level not drained on any Polder card still showing its water side.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest VP score is the winner.

From the rulebook: The senior witch Mania has a terrible witches cold. The witches congregation decides to make a witches brew that will heal her. A senior witch that has a cold isnt useful to the witches. So we hurry up to the Blocksberg (a mountain in the german harz region where witches are said to be gathering), where the herbs grow. But beware: between healing herbs there is the devilsleaves. And that has a scent which makes witches unable to move...&#10;&#10;The players place plastic chips of their own colour on the gameboard. Then a black chip representing the devils leaves. By rolling a die they can move on the board, forwards and backwards. The goal of the game is to collect their two own colour chips and reach the top of the game board to place them into the witches cauldron while avoiding the black chip. When reaching other players chips they can play tricks on them...&#10;&#10;"

114021,,"The Concept&#10;&#10;Hollywood Hookups is the first trivia game that links celebrities through biographical facts. The connections are real. And so are the celebrities. The concept of the game is very simple - you are given the names of two individuals that both dated or were married to the same person. You will have to come up with the name of the middle person. Hollywood Hookups links all kinds of celebrities - actors and actresses, musicians, athletes, and royalty. The trivia questions are in 3 different categories, and span the contemporary era to early 20th century.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;The actual board game consists of a board, more than 500 question cards, 50 tokens, 1 die and 6 colored game pieces (red, yellow, blue, green, pink and orange). This is a family-friendly game for 2 to 6 players, ages 13 and up. The object of the game is to collect tokens by answering trivia questions correctly. The first player to get 8 tokens wins the game. This game can either be a single-player game, or it can be played in teams of 2 or 3. We really like the design of the board - the maroon color of the board contrasts nicely with the gold accents. The outside of the box has a white background, with more than 30 different celebrity names on the box - Marilyn Monroe, Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, to name a few.&#10;&#10;The Question Cards&#10;&#10;The questions come in 3 different categories - Modern, Classic and Connect 3. The Modern cards have questions about contemporary celebrities; the Classic cards have questions about classic (old Hollywood) celebrities. Both of those types of cards only have one celebrity as the answer. The Connect 3 cards have contemporary celebrities, but the connection involves 3 different celebrities. These questions are much harder, but we're sure you're up to the challenge! Please see the designs below.&#10;&#10;"
