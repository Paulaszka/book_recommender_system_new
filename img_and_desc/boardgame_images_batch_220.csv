These tiles are subdivided evenly into &lsquo;moon&rsquo; tiles and &lsquo;sun&rsquo; tiles. There are also a number of Gold and Silver bonus tiles. If you complete scoring rows in all three directions through these tiles, then you can also add the bonus values to your total!&#10;&#10;The individual playing boards are double-sided, so you can choose to play on the challenging &lsquo;Nexus&rsquo; board (45 minutes), or on the stylish Orchid board for a quicker and distinctly different game (25 minutes).&#10;&#10;When playing on the Nexus board, all 64 tiles are used. You can enhance your score by skillful use of the Gold and Silver bonus tiles and by cunningly interlacing &lsquo;sunrays&rsquo; and &lsquo;moonbeams&rsquo; with your other scoring rows. If it all seems to be going desperately wrong, you can dispose of unwanted tiles by placing them in your &lsquo;Scrap Yard&rsquo;. But beware - an &lsquo;untidy&rsquo; scrapyard can cost you penalty points!&#10;&#10;When playing on the Orchid board, choose either the &lsquo;sun&rsquo; or &lsquo;moon&rsquo; tiles.

The game is played on a 4 by 4 square grid, which is marked a-d on the horizontal axis and 1-4 on the vertical axis for record keeping.&#10;&#10;There are three types of pieces, which are identical for black and white.  First are the ORBS, which are circular pieces with red, yellow, green or blue in the center. The second type of pieces are ARCS, which have a stripe of color matching those of the orbs.  The arcs are 120 degrees in extension, so three arcs fit around an orb.  HALOS are the third piece type, and are either white or black.  They are rings which fit outside the orbs and arcs.  There are four orbs, four arcs and six halos of each color, made of plastic.&#10;&#10;The orbs are set up on the 1 and 4 rows with the matching color arcs with those orbs.  Play consists of each player moving one orb one square horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  The matching color of arc MUST be then moved.  Arcs can move to any other legal square on the board.&#10;&#10;The easiest way to win is to trap an opposing orb with three arcs of any color around it (an Arc-win).  If you can box in your opponents orbs so that he has no valid moves, then you have gained an Orb-win.  Finally, if you can move your four pieces inside four halos of your own color you have completed a halo win.  A draw is an option through player agreement or stalemate from repeated moves.&#10;&#10;A halo is &quot;earned&quot; by moving three of your arcs so that they form a complete ring, with no orbs inside it.

It is chess-like in the powers and types of moves available, but there are a few spaces on the board that are limited to certain pieces, some pieces are used for blocking only, and some pieces are promoted when others are captured, which can tip the balance, making a capture or sacrifice critical to the outcome. There are two winning conditions: either the capture of the opponent&rsquo;s offensive pieces, or the defilement (occupation) of your opponent&rsquo;s temple for a full turn.&#10;&#10;"
