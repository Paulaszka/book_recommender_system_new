Your goal is to eliminate your opponents' warriors by strategically attacking them with your men. To accomplish this, you must engage the services of the neutral team (also called the Robot Team). Beware! Because your opponent gains control of the neutral robots on his turn. Both opponents move toward the center power source. Here they many choose to regenerate their forces or decide upon a strategic super attack. Look out! The unseen move can propel you or destroy you. Never give up... comebacks are always possible. Maybe you will be the next TRILOGY master.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player gets a team of six markers, and there is a third &quot;team,&quot; that is the neutral robot. Each turn, players can move one of their pieces and one of the robot pieces. Pieces can move or jump other pieces. Jumping an opponents' piece or a robot piece eliminates that piece. Moving to the center dot on the board allows a player to generate another piece or take an extra turn. The first player to eliminate the opponent's team wins.&#10;&#10;Published by &quot;Ellis and Frazier Games&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Players then take turns drawing from the &quot;Trade&quot; pile, which allows them to turn over cards and trade them with other players' cards, as well as mix up theirs or someone else's hand, or trade with the draw pile. When a player thinks (s)he has a complete set of four cards, the player announces it and turns their cards over. If the cards are four of a kind, the player gets a new hand. Otherwise, they lose their next turn. The first team to successfully reveal two complete sets wins.&#10;&#10;"

American Carrom differs from Carrom in the board construction, particularly the larger size of the pockets and the striker (shooter) being the same size as the other pieces. American Carrom can also be played with a cue, and the board is patterned with checkers, chess or other board motifs, allowing a variety of other games to be played.  Many American Carrom boards also double as Crokinole boards.&#10;&#10;In American Carrom the object is to flick to strike the Carrom men into the pockets in a similar fashion to pool or billiards.  Sometimes a cue is used rather than flicking.  Due to the larger pocket size American Carrom lacks some of the strategy and skill required of the 'proper' version of the game.&#10;&#10;Also noteworthy is the fact that American Carrom uses rings for game pieces whereas Carrom game pieces are solid discs.&#10;&#10;European games in a similar vein: Korona and H-ring spel.&#10;&#10;"

You&rsquo;ll have to use all the speed of the track to overcome your opponents and force your way through to the goal with that heartless steel ball.&#10;&#10;Each player manages his team of skaters, catchers and bikers in an effort to score goals with the ball. Each member of the team is represented by a counter (or figure), with vital information recorded on a separate card. The speed of movement is recorded with a sliding clip on the side of the card, and adjusted turn by turn as the figures race around the track. The player must pull order out of chaos as his team struggles with opponents to control the ball and score goals.&#10;&#10;The movement of figures is affected by the speed and agility of the figure. Complex manuevers, interactions with opposing figures (such as striking and checking) and handling the ball are resolved with dice rolls. As the game progresses, injuries and fatigue will reduce the effectiveness of the team, and play strategy includes decisions about protecting key figures and targeting particular opponents in this full contact sport.&#10;&#10;Playing time is extremely long.

You are charged with ensuring that you are not only profitable, but you are keeping these new colonies alive and thriving in this backwater part of the galaxy.&#10;&#10;You also have competitors... others who wish to attract the attention of the Emperor by being the best. You must struggle to supply systems with goods at a profit. You must also struggle to gain influence through your trade in key systems that will attract future rewards from the Emperor himself. But options are limited... you don&rsquo;t hear of deliveries when needed and your opponents do.&#10;&#10;You are beset with a changing political landscape in this sector as colonies grow. Demand for certain goods shifts like sand. Danger and discovery await. Your network of informants and insiders provide you with information. As time passes, it becomes harder to trade safely as success attracts attention &mdash; sometimes from unsavory characters. The finest merchants rise to this challenge, but they are ever-mindful of not making the Emperor jealous...&#10;&#10;THIS is life in Right Ascension...&#10;&#10;"

Unclaimed tiles are placed back into the Zingo tile holder. If two players call the same tile, it goes to whoever called it first.

This rumor rekindles their passion for Tikal and the two scientists start to discuss the prospect of another expedition to Central America. In the midst of their planning they encounter Profs. Braff and Pauchon at an international archaeology conference in Geneva, who want to know the truth about the enticing rumour.&#10;&#10;Later that day, sitting in front of a roaring fire after a fine meal finished off with Cuban cigars and a few brandies, the two Swiss scientists listen enthralled by the unfolding plans of their German colleagues.
