Other children can break up a fight by landing on that same space, or tattle by landing on a nun's space. If a nun moves onto the fight space, the attacker is sent back to the entrance for detention. Finishing thirty of the minute-long turns marks the end of the game, or it ends immediately when one player's boy and girl figures meet on the same space while out of sight of the nuns.

Only tiles with 0 to 6 dots are used. One player is designated 'white' while the other is 'black.' The players take turn placing tiles on the board, starting with the player who is dealt the lowest numbered double-tile, who must place this a his first move.&#10;&#10;Tiles are placed according to the following restrictions:&#10;&#10;* A tile must be placed such that it spans two squares (i.e., one half of the tile is on a black square and the other half is on a white).&#10;    * No two tiles can share a square.&#10;    * If a tile is placed next to another tile, the number of dots on the touching tile-end(s) must match that of its (their) neighbour. If a tile-end is next to several other tile-ends, only one of these need to match.&#10;&#10;When there are no un-drawn tiles left and two passes in a row occur (i.e., both players pass), the game ends. At this point, the unfilled areas on the board are scored: Each connected unfilled area on the board counts to the color that is in majority in that area. If there is the same number of black and white squares, no player gets points for the area.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Kings cannot move but can be captured.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player chooses one of his own checkers to move. Moves are made vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. A single move consists of picking up the chosen checker, jumping it over an opponent's checker or king (the jumped checker or king must be directly above, below, left, or right of the moving checker), and landing on an unoccupied square on the other side of the jumped checker. The jumped checker or king is then captured (removed from the board). On the same turn, a player may (but is not required to) continue moving this chosen checker in this way, until that checker cannot capture any more. A checker can only move if in so doing it captures an opponent's checker or king.&#10;&#10;On his turn, after he has finished capturing, a player may use the checkers which he has just captured to transform some of his opponent's checkers into kings, by placing a single captured checker on top of a checker of the same color which is still on the board.
