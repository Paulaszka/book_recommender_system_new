As you might guess from the title, Sticky Stickz includes a bunch of Sticky Sticks, one for each player &ndash; and what does one do with a Sticky Stick? Stick things, of course!&#10;&#10;The game board consists of plastic wells in the bottom of the box, with each well holding a number of tiles; each tile shows 1-3 faces in one of three colors with one of three facial expressions. For each round, someone rolls the three dice &ndash; color die, number die, facial expression die &ndash; then everyone simultaneously tries to grab any tiles that match one or more of the dice by sticking those tiles with their Sticky Stick. Once all the matching tiles have been claimed, you roll the dice again and stick some more.&#10;&#10;Once a certain number of wells are empty, players compare their stacks of tiles and the player with the tallest stack wins.&#10;&#10;"

Search through the mythical places of &quot;Adventures of Tintin and the Secret of the Unicorn.&quot; You must pass a number of missions in the 4 corners of the world: the big escape, combats against pirates, a motorcycle chase - many challenges wait for you, each of them on different boards and using cards for the events.

As such the earlier historical description comments still apply:&#10;&#10;&quot;This set of rules are intended to cover the engagements that took place between 1861 and 1865 during the American Civil War. The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.&#10;&#10;As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Each player is the head of the military forces of one of the opposing star powers.  The rules aren't extensive, but wide enough to cover many nuances of intense fighting in the Star Era.

The rules contain corresponding chapters if players wish to switch from one firing way to another. Warriors, cannons and fighting machines are snap together kits requiring no glue for assembly.&#10;&#10;From the official rules of the game:&#10;&#10;ARMORED INFANTRY is a sci-fi game that can be played by several players at the same time, each with their own army. To win, it is necessary to defeat the enemy army or complete some task - a mission. Missions can be very different, for example, to capture an object, destroy an enemy command vehicle, hold a line, etc.&#10;&#10;Player armies consist of squads of armored infantry, manned combat vehicles, and artillery pieces. Their game parameters are indicated in special &quot;documents&quot; - Army Lists.&#10;&#10;Each vehicle or squad of infantrymen is a separate unit. During the battle, players take turns operating their units &ndash; moving them, shooting at the enemy, or engaging the enemy in close combat. When one unit has finished its actions, i.e. has completed its turn, it is time for the next unit's turn, and so on. Each unit can only make one turn per round, so when all units have made one turn, a new round begins. At the beginning of each round, the players play the initiative, i.e. determine who will go first, who will go second, etc. If all soldiers - infantrymen and machine pilots - in the player's army are destroyed, then he is out of the game. The rest of the participants continue the battle without him. Thus, round after round, the battle continues until one of the players wins.&#10;&#10;"
