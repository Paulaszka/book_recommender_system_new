These two corps, with tremendous artillery support, have an overwhelming superiority in numbers over the French Imperial forces.&#10;&#10;The battle, which saw the Coalition forces push the Poles and French out of the Wiederitzsch after three brutal hours of combat, was among the most intensive of any of the battles in the Leipzig cycle.

Liberal historians tend to focus on the political and ideological background of the revolution and ignore the social and economic issues. Left wing historians, particularly Anarchist writers, tend to view the revolution as the expression of the mass will to reject authoritarian intervention in their liberty and freedom. Revisionist historians consider the revolution as arising primarily from below, that is, from the peasants and the workers. And most historians tend to take an obligatory swipe at the Tsar, Tsarina and Rasputin, and then ignore the bureaucracy, the armed forces high command (Stavka) and the bourgeois reactionaries forever after.&#10;&#10;Rather than attempt to justify one or the other of these dogmas, perhaps it would be easier to realize that Russia in 1917 was an enormous paradox. She was one of the largest countries in the world in terms of both area and population, yet her economy was primitive and underdeveloped, and 85% of her population consisted of illiterate and superstitious peasants with no interests in anything much beyond the limits of their own villages, least of all politics. Russia was about a century behind the development of the other Great Powers, and although she was finally trying to catch up, she was handicapped by a political system and an absolute monarch that were simply unequal to the 20th Century. When the revolution finally came, it was solely Russian, which is to say, a national phenomenon with a traditional outlook; and it adhered to the Standard Operating Procedures for revolutions, which is to say, that it was initiated by the moderates and then ultimately taken over by the extremists. But to Lenin and his Bolshevik organization, the revolution was going to have a global outlook with the intent of imposing Lenin&rsquo;s vision of socialism on the entire world.&#10;&#10;Regardless of the name given to the events in Petrograd in 1917, the facts are that there was a popular revolution followed by a Bolshevik coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Petrograd 1917 starts with the popular revolution that had been initiated by the moderates, was taken over by the extremists, and then succumbed to the inevitable coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat. Players will find that staging a successful coup will not be as easy as it was for Lenin, who was blessed with the unwitting but invaluable assistance of Kerensky.&#10;&#10;This is a card-based simulation for 2 to 6 players, each of whom will try to create a political organization and help it to gain influence, so that it becomes the predominant political party in Russia, either by votes or by force. The game board represents Petrograd, the capital of Russia, which was the site of most of what happened at the time. Markers and counters on the board indicate where army units, factories, bridges, railroad stations and other important buildings are located.&#10;&#10;"

All these actions can be fought by releasing pieces, clearing pathways, by rescuing isolated blocks and attacking blocks that impede movement termination. &#10;A more strategic complexity is achieved with the four-player mode in teams of two; playing with half the blocks of his team each player has two opponents and one ally.&#10;&#10;"

The Trumptus is their only hope of chasing away evil Panthea and her Munculus warriors. But where to look for the pieces? They are all over Centopia, and behind every corner there might be an evil Munculus warrior. Cautiously, the players search for the pieces. Will they be able to find all the pieces before Panthea manages to mobilise her troops?&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The Trumptus and Munculus chits are randomised and placed into the slits in the game board. Each player gets an elf board. The Panthea board is placed in the middle of the table, next to the game board. Players take turns rolling the die. If a number from 1-3 is rolled, the corresponding number of chits is taken from the game board and placed in front of the active player's elf board. Then he/she can decide if they want to roll again or end their turn. They may repeat this step as often as they want, as long as they don't draw a Munculus chit from the board or roll the Munculus symbol.&#10;If a player decides to end their turn, they place all the Trumptus chits of their own colour on their elf board. They return the Trumptus chits of other players' colours to the game board (putting them into slits of their choice). Then it's the next player's turn.&#10;If a Munculus chit is drawn, the player's turn is over immediately. The Munculus chit is placed on the Panthea board. Previously drawn Trumptus chits are returned to the board and the die is handed over to the next player. If the Munculus symbol is rolled, the player's turn is over too. All previously drawn Trumptus chits are given to the players they belong to, and they place them on their elf boards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has placed all 8 Trumptus chits of their colour on their elf board. That player wins the game. The game also ends when the Panthea board has been completely filled with Munculus chits. In this case, Panthea wins. Second place goes to the player who has collected the most Trumptus chits.&#10;&#10;"

This is the evil snake's fault, because she has coaxed the time watchman into turning back the time. Who is going to help the Little Prince and his friends to scare away the snake and bring the hours of the day and night into the correct sequence?&#10;&#10;Setup: The starting tile is placed in the middle of the table. The time rays are placed to its sides so that a long time ray from 0 to 24 hours is created (the time rays have numbers from 0-24 printed on them). The hour tiles (showing clocks) are shuffled together with the snake tiles and put face down on the table.

Then he/she turns over one of the face-down tiles from the middle of the table. If it shows the same time as the position the player has put his/her character tile in (e.g. the character tile is on the &quot;11&quot; position of the time ray and the tile depicts a clock showing 11 o'clock), the hour tile is put in that position, the character tile is returned to the player, and he/she earns a cogwheel chit. If the hour tile doesn't match, the hour tile is returned to its old place in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;If a snake tile is turned over, the player has two options: First, he/she can simply return the snake tile face down to its old place. Second, he/she can return it face up and try to turn over the other two snake tiles. If he/she is successful, he/she immediately wins the game. If he/she isn't, he/she loses a cogwheel chit and then it's the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;There are two ways the game can end:&#10;a) The evil snake has been defeated (i.e. a player has turned over all three snake tiles). In this case there are two winners: The player who has turned over the snake tiles and the player who at this moment owns the most cogwheel chits.&#10;b) All the hour tiles have been correctly placed on the time ray.

Players are the bosses of their families in the 1930's gangster era. Players hire thugs, bookies and torpedos to help them gain control of the various rackets in the city. Card play weakens/enhances family strengths duing the game. The major twist is the HIT die, played during a racket round, where every character is a target!&#10;&#10;Mature themes (nothing you couldn't read about in any Time-Life book from the library), recommended for 12+ years.&#10;&#10;From the designer of Battle of the bands, Backstage Pass and Portable Adventures card games.&#10;&#10;Players (families) battle each other to control a set number of rackets, 2 of one kind of racket or 3 of any kind racket.  You build your family using thug, bookie and torpedo cards, collectively known as mug cards. They're point value is your power during rackets. When a racket card is being fought over, the players all roll a HIT die (1d6),any opponent mugs in play that match your die roll (a die is printed on the mug cards), those cards are eithered flipped-unusable during this round, or discarded. The die roll is then added to the remaining value of your mugs in play, highest score wins the contract. But, you must have a mug who can control that racket, otherwise it is discarded. Family cards are played during non racket rounds to help your family or hinder the opposition.&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts with one worker cards on the table and five action cards in hand; an action card shows a combination of one of the five resources and one of the three workers. On a turn, the player first reveals one of the face-down resource cards, then chooses one of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Passes on playing cards and draws two action cards. (A player can hold at most eight cards.)&#10;    Plays two action cards that bear the same symbol, takes the appropriate action (claim a character or extract resources), then draws one action card. (Any two action cards can be used as a joker, but you need at least one symbol of the appropriate type to take an action.)&#10;&#10;&#10;What do the characters do? Each investor has a different resource symbol, and when you extract that resource in the future, you need to play only one card instead of two. The salesman either boosts the value of a particular resource or the value of a character type at the end of the game. The worker allows you extract more resources.&#10;&#10;When you extract resources, you take one card from the resource row (starting at the left) for each worker you have in front of you, then replace those cards with face-down cards from the resource deck. When the last resource card is revealed, each player takes on final turn, then they tally their scores, scoring $1,000 for each character and the printed value for each resource card (unless a salesman modifies those values). The player with the highest total wins!&#10;&#10;The five salesman cards in Siberia: The Card Game can be used as an expansion for Siberia, and rules for this expansion are included.&#10;&#10;Expands (while also being a standalone game)&#10;&#10;&#10;    Siberia&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Grab your hand and play cards building your pen to capture the pigs.  However, be careful, as your opponent will be looking to ruin your hard work and steal your pigs!&#10;&#10;In a game of Pig-Pen, players are dealt a hand of five cards,  with these cards they are going to build pens to capture pigs.  A stack of Pigs, depending on the number of players, is the timer for the game.  Once these pigs are gone the game is over.  On their turn players replenish their hands back to five cards, then they are allowed to play two cards and finally they may discard any number of cards they choose.  The choices they have are to either build their pen(s) or attack their opponent(s.)  Pens are made six cards: Four Pen cards, a Feed card to entice the pig and finally a Gate card.  Players can attack their opponents with attack cards that destroy Pen cards or Unlock Gates.  Even when a Pig is captured, it still isn't safe as players can attempt to steal it with Attack cards.  Players ultimate goal is to have the best point Pigs in their Pens at games end.&#10;&#10;Pig-Pen also features three levels of play.  A simple children's level, an intermediate level with some number comparisons.  And the always fun Secret Bacon Pack, where no Pig is safe from destruction of the bacon kind.&#10;&#10;"
