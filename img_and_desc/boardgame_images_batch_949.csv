Using psychology to out-think the opponents is needed, as the ending is never certain.&#10;&#10;After a long war, the feudal system has declined, and leading aristocrats began to fight for the right to inherit the throne. Soldiers engage in combat seeking specific rewards.&#10;&#10;Practical rewards often cause betrayal and secession and end the era of loyalty and justice.

Form an army stronger than anyone in an arms race, for the war will bring in troops and mercenaries owned by other aristocrats.&#10;&#10;Only players can see their units targeted for the competition, so it is fun to have a psychological battle with such bluffing or bargaining. Without knowing the enmey well enough, players cannot forecast the winner.&#10;user

Unfortunately, you're not alone; you've been followed by other treasure raiders, and you'll have to act quickly and shrewdly to secure the plunder for yourself.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;This is a thematic abstract spatial strategy game for 2-8 players in which players place and demolish walls to be the first to reach the treasures in the center of the labyrinth.&#10;It's recommended to play with 2-4 individual players or 2 teams of 2-4 players each. Game length scales by player count; roughly 15 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;The game is played on a square grid board, which is empty at setup except for 13 treasures near the center and player pawns adjacent to the corners. At the start of the game, players are dealt a hand of labyrinth wall cards which correspond to labyrinth wall pieces which are played on the board throughout the course of the game.&#10;&#10;TURNS&#10;Players take turns in clockwise order, choosing to perform one of four actions each turn; moving their player pawn, playing a labyrinth wall card to place a labyrinth wall on the board, weakening one of their own labyrinth walls on the board, or placing their rubble token on any labyrinth wall on the board.&#10;&#10;MECHANICS&#10;Pawns can only move orthogonally and can only stop when hitting either a labyrinth wall or the edge of the board, and pass through other pawns. Pawns collect treasure by moving through the treasure's square. Labyrinth walls are weakened whenever a pawn hits them, eventually being demolished instead and removed from the board. Players can only draw a new card when one of their labyrinth walls is removed from the board. Each player has only one rubble token; this can be played on any labyrinth wall on the board and acts as an open square, but must remain on that wall until the wall is demolished.&#10;&#10;TEAM PLAY&#10;Playing the game with two teams is the same as playing with individuals, except that collected treasure is pooled for each team on a team treasure board, and public table talk is typically allowed.&#10;&#10;STRATEGY&#10;Basic strategies involve placing labyrinth walls to either let your pawn stop in line with treasure, or to block other player's pawns. More advanced strategies include accomplishing both of the above with a single wall placement, using other player's constructions to your advantage, and placing walls to create an unblockable path to one or more treasures. Additionally, being careful to not run out of cards and using your rubble token wisely are both important.&#10;The ability to visualize and plan potential routes and layouts is key to mastering the game's strategy. Team play brings even more strategic depth; teammates can help each other achieve goals and work together to thwart the competition.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;The game ends immediately once it is no longer possible for the player(s) with the fewest treasures to gain enough treasures to have the most treasures. The number of treasures needed to win per player count is specified in the instruction manual for clarity.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

A &quot;Challenger&quot; starts the game by flipping over a category card such as &quot;When I drink Tequila I...&quot; They then challenge each person at the table one by one by flipping over a letter card which has a random letter of the alphabet on it. The first person (between the challenger and the person they are battling) to shout out a word or short phrase, fitting the category and starting with that letter, wins the letter card. They then move on to the next person at the table in a clockwise rotation. After everyone at the table has been challenged the &quot;challenger&quot; passes the letter cards to the person on their left and now that person is the new &quot;challenger&quot;. They flip over a new category card and play continues in the same pattern.&#10;&#10;When all letter cards have been played, this concludes round one. Everyone counts their letter cards and the person with the most cards wins that round. Keep a tally of the winner and shuffle the letter cards to start a new round.

If you answered &quot;Shoe&quot; that does not make sense with the category and the group takes a vote on if it fits or not.

On your turn, you can place members on one or both equipment areas to gain tokens; placing one figure means you retrieve the first token from the pile, two figures the second token, etc. The visible side of a token represents a vehicle &mdash; a train (red), a car (yellow), a boat (blue), or an airship (green) &mdash; while the hidden side depicts two or three locations on the world map. For each token you take, choose whether to keep the vehicle side face up or flip it over to reveal the mission side of the token. Once you choose, the token is locked, and you place it in front of you with your other vehicle and mission tokens.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, instead of collecting equipment you can place members on map locations. Each location shows 2-3 vehicle tiles, and you must have all depicted tiles in front of you to place a member on a location. Each time you place a member, choose one of the vehicle tokens used, then place it in the discard pile next to the box. (If you travel to the location of another player's member, you instead give them the discarded token.)&#10;&#10;After you either collect vehicle/mission tokens or send members on expeditions, you can complete one or more missions if you have a member on each of the 2-3 locations depicted on that mission.

Each player receives 5 dice.&#10;&#10;In &rsquo;Jam&lsquo; the platforms have a new 'JAM line' which keeps the hole at a distance of 11cm so the 'hole in 1' shot is just as elusive.&#10;&#10;In &rsquo;Sumo&rsquo; the platforms include a 'protection pier' which will protect you from a 'blast' shot from a &lsquo;kamikaze&rsquo; neighbour.&#10;&#10;

The main thing is that in the end you have your nose in front and most of the carrots are collected.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll three dice. Depending on the result of the dice, one or two carrots can then be taken from the supply or stolen by an opponent. Unfortunately, if you are unlucky you have to give back some of your hard-collected carrots.&#10;&#10;In this game it is recommended to not only keep an eye on your own carrot pile, but to also watch the collections of the other players.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the carrot supply in the middle of the table is used up and the player with the most carrots wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

When it is your turn, you must lay at least one of your fitting cow cards on a task card. But only the player, who places the last missing card and finishes a task, gets a point chip. It also means: don't make a forward pass! Otherwise the other players will collect the points.&#10;&#10;"

Each sets off on their preferred trail and seeks to rescue the various species that are in danger and return them to their &quot;hide&quot; (starting location).&#10;&#10;The many cards and interrupts offer gratuitous opportunities to learn more about the South African flora and fauna, while avoiding poachers and other pitfalls. While the educational content is aimed at South African children, for those outside the country it functions equally educationally for adults.&#10;&#10;From the promotional material: &quot;An innovative boardgame that encourages forward-planning and strategic decision-making. Trading and bargaining form part of this exciting, fast-moving game!&quot;.&#10;&#10;"
