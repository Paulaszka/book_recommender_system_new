On your turn you must do the following actions:&#10;&#10;1) PLAY A TILE from your Activation Area.&#10;&#10;The first tile played by each player WILL NOT ACTIVATE ITS ABILITY. So it is very important you choose well which of your archetypes wont be used in the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;A tile played must always be adjacent to another tile (even diagonally) So you cannot place a tile anywhere in the imaginary grid.&#10;&#10;A tile played always enters the game on the side it was in the Activation Area. So if the tile played was ACTIVE it stays with the side of the banner up and if the tile was INACTIVE it stays with the side that has a token drawn.&#10;&#10;Consider INACTIVE tiles as protected from abilities when they are in PLAY since abilities cannot target INACTIVE tiles. It&acute;s a very good strategy to keep this in mind because an opponent won&acute;t be able to affect one of your INACTIVE tiles.&#10;&#10;2) ACTIVE its ability (if possible)&#10;&#10;Tiles that have been affected by an ability are turned to the INACTIVE SIDE (the one with the token on it). Same happens with the King and Queen.&#10;&#10;Abilities cannot affect tiles that are in play with the INACTIVE SIDE up. This means that once a tile has been turned to the INACTIVE SIDE it&acute;s safe on the board. It can be moved as usual by its owner but will not altered by an opponent.&#10;&#10;&#10;3) MOVE ONE OF YOUR TILES IN PLAY ONE SPACE (diagonally or perpendicularly)&#10;&#10;Notice that the joker has a special ability that allows you to move ONE MORE TIME after you placed it. This is a very strategical ability that can make big difference when you are trying to reposition a high influence tile on your turn or when you want to remove an opponent tile as well. Under no circumstance a tile can end up or move over another tile in the table.&#10;&#10;When you move a tile it must always end adjacent to another tile. So you cannot move it on empty space unless it ended there due to the movement of the other tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;END GAME &amp; WINNING CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;The game will end when one of this two conditions happen:&#10;&#10;1) One player starts his/her turn with his target consort surrounded by his own tiles  (perpendicularly).&#10;&#10;The victory is total. The more you play the less this condition is going to happen.&#10;&#10;2) The players have played all of their tiles.&#10;&#10;Once the players have played all of their tiles comes the scoring. For this step only the tiles that surround PERSPERNDICULARLY (up, down and sides) each royal consort will count. Add all the influence numbers in the tiles, PLUS all the tokens if there are INACTIVE tiles among them (each one is worth 1 point) MINUS the total influence on the tiles your opponent has surrounding your royal consort. Compare this numbers... the player with the most influence WINS the game. In case of a tie... you are both too smart to outwit each other :)&#10;&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;20 double sided tiles&#10;1 king&#10;1 queen&#10;&#10;"

Partnerships change with each hand, and scoring is by individual. Trumps change with each hand, determined by a d6 die-roll.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game. The game ends after each player has dealt one hand. During the game, each player will be partnered with every other player. Partnership designations shift after each hand. A unique feature is that the dealer is always a partner with the player on his right.&#10;&#10;A partial deck is used, with the number of cards determined by the number of players. Five cards are dealt to each player, with one being face-up. Only four tricks are played in each hand.&#10;&#10;Each trick captured counts 1 point, and each Queen and Deuce counts 1 point. Each member of a partnership scores the total points caught by the entire partnership.&#10;&#10;"

The first player to play all of his cards wins.&#10;&#10;In each game round, all players choose one of their hand cards, then reveal them simultaneously. In alphabetical order, players place their card adjacent to a card on the table to create or extend a row or column of letters. You must then say a word that starts with the letters in this row or column. If you extend a row and a column at the same time, you must say a word for the row and a word for the column. Once five or more rows/columns consist of at least two connected cards, you may place a letter only if you extend the length of a row or column to three cards or more.&#10;&#10;If you cannot place a letter card because you can't create a word, then you must remove all cards from the longest row or column and add half of these cards to your hand. (Set the other cards aside as a penalty pile.) If you still can't place a letter in order to create a word, you must remove another word, etc.&#10;&#10;If you place a letter card and connect separate areas of the grid &mdash; which were separated due to someone needing to remove a word &mdash; then you discard one of your penalty cards.&#10;&#10;Typo 2D includes icons on some cards that can be used for variants, such as a card that can replace another card or a card you must place behind an empty spot and &quot;fill in&quot; the empty spot by saying a word.&#10;&#10;"

player has 3 cards and 3 tokens, each of which represents Royalty, Assassin, and Slave.

Then next player does the same, and so on. When all players are done, reveal all cards they played and resolve the outcome. If one or more Royalties are in play, each Assassin in play kills one of them. Successful Assassins win the round. After the assassination, if one or more Royalties are still in play, survived Royalties win the round, otherwise all Slaves win the round. Winners get points, and players who have lied and still didn't win the round lose points. A game ends when a player gains total of 8 points. A player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each tile space has a specific tile that can be placed on it. The squares are numbered from 4-64 by fours. The edges of the board are also numbered, from 1-4.&#10;&#10;The game can be played in two ways. In the aptly-named &quot;Game of Chance&quot; two to five players take turns drawing a tile and placing it on its designated space.

The scoring rule is the same, but here each player starts with half the blocks and can choose which one to play, generally speaking. If three sides of a block have been played this forces the fourth side to be played as soon as possible, and if that is the third tile for another square it forces that fourth tile immediately, etc.&#10;&#10;The designer patented the game some years before publishing it.&#10;&#10;Note that the board shown in the patent is not exactly the same as the published version, as the rules state the squares in each quarter of the board sum to 136.&#10;&#10;"

Battleships and cruisers can move several squares on a turn but are restricted to squares of a particular color. Submarines only move one square a turn but can use either color. Submarines capture enemy ships by landing on them, but the larger ships capture by jumping.&#10;&#10;Each side starts the game by mining ten squares on their shores; when an enemy ship crosses such a square a card is drawn which may have a bad effect.&#10;&#10;Each side has four objective cards which they randomly select one of at the start of the game, keeping it hidden from the opponent(s). The game is won by the side achieving its objective first.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by more than two players by dividing one or both sides between players.&#10;&#10;"

The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!&#10;&#10;Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard &quot;worker placement&quot; genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place &ndash; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.&#10;&#10;As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.&#10;&#10;"

To earn points and win the game, the players attempt to sacrifice Minions from their cult to the Shoggoth (bad news for Minions, but what do you expect when you join an evil cult?). However, the Shoggoth is indiscriminate in who it eats; if you can't feed the Shoggoth on your turn with a Minion, it eats you, and you're out of the game!&#10;&#10;During your turn, if the Shoggoth is in front of you, you have the ability to sacrifice on Minion from your hand. The other Cult Leaders at the table can attempt to disrupt your sacrifice by casting spells to move the Shoggoth away from you, stealing Minions from your hand, or any one of many dastardly methods (Rival Cult Leaders are insidious that way).&#10;&#10;If the active player is still able to keep the Shoggoth in front of them during their sacrifice phase, the Minion is gobbled up, the player earns a point token, the Shoggoth moves to the player to the left, and the active player draws back up to their hand limit.&#10;&#10;The winner is either the first player to reach the victory point goal (determined how many players are participating), or the last player standing.&#10;&#10;The theme of the game is based on the works of HP Lovecraft; those players who are familiar with either the stories of HPL and/or the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game will recognize many of the names and terms on the cards.

Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.&#10;&#10;Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.&#10;&#10;You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

Then the players alternately make their moves thereafter.&#10;&#10;Rules of the Game: This checkers variation is played using an 8 x 8, or 64 squares checker board of light and dark squares and each player has 12 pieces of contrasting colors, usually red and white. The board is placed between the two players in such a way that the double corner is on the right side and a dark colored square is on the left side of each player. The player places his pieces on the first three rows on his side of the board&#10;&#10;The Moves of the Men: Checker players can only move their pieces forward one at a time on each empty square to the left or to the right. If a player successfully moves his pieces to the last, or &quot;king row,&quot; then that piece must be crowned &quot;king&quot; by the opponent by placing a second checker on top of the crowned piece.&#10;&#10;The Moves of the King: King pieces are &quot;flying kings,&quot; which means that they can move over many empty squares on the diagonal lines that pass over the square on which they are located.&#10;&#10;Captures: In Brazilian Checkers captures are mandatory. And, maximum captures are compulsory as well, which means that if a player has more than one way to capture the opposing pieces then he must choose that way that will result in the capture of the most number of pieces. If a checker piece reaches the king row while in a capture sequence, it must keep on capturing pieces backward for as long as there still pieces to capture. That capturing piece cannot be crowned king unless it finishes the move and stops on king row.&#10;&#10;Captures by the Men: Men can capture by jumping forward or backward over a single piece that is located next to it only if the square located next to the captured piece is unoccupied. If the man can jump again from its landing square to make another capture, then it must do so because all captures are mandatory.&#10;&#10;Captures by a King: A crowned piece can capture an opponent's piece forward and backward diagonally if it is on the same path where it is located and if the squares between them are unoccupied and that if the square immediately after the piece that will be captured is also unoccupied. The crowned piece can land on any empty square within the same path and if a continuous capture is possible, then the player must keep on capturing even if this move will not redound to the best interest of the player making the capture.&#10;&#10;The Winning Player: A player wins the game if he has captured all of his opponent's pieces or successfully blocked his opponent's pieces such that the opponent is unable to move any of his pieces.&#10;&#10;Conditions for a Draw: The players can mutually agree to a draw. A draw may also happen if the same position has occurred three times during the game, or if there are three crowned pieces playing against one and that both players have made 16 moves without attaining any promotion or making a capture.&#10;&#10;Information from checkershistory.com&#10;&#10;"

Unbeknownst to the rest of you, one of your friends is secretly a Cultist, eager to sacrifice the rest of you to their dark master.&#10;&#10;The Academics must work together to accomplish the goals of the scenario before the stars align and the Cultist is able to pull off their scheme, reveal themselves, and summon a Shoggoth, a flight of Night Gaunts, or reveal themselves to have been a Mi-Go the whole time, to pick three example Cultists from a single scenario, the Fungi from Yuggoth.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds, consisting of each player taking a turn, and then one University Phase. On a turn, a player draws an Event card related to their location, resolves it using a push-your-luck ability check mechanic which forces them to make trade offs between personal harm or harm to the group, and then takes two Actions: Move, Fight, Search, Steal, Trade, Use an Item, or a Scenario specific event. The University Phase consist of moving any monsters that may be on the board, followed by the starting player drawing two University cards, selecting one to play and one to shuffle back into the deck without revealing. These cards are all bad for the Academics, but in different ways and to different degrees, so this is another opportunity for the Cultist to secretly advance their own agenda. The starting player then passes the Starting Player token to their left and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;The Academic players are trying to complete their Scenario specific goals before the Cultist kills them. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth scenario, the Academic goals are: A1: assemble a complete Elder Sign, A2: take it to Chapel, B1: find the Necronomicon in the Vault or Library, B2: use it as described on its card. Players gain Elder Sign pieces by successfully completing Events, by searching, or by making them in the Art Department with a Finesse check. Players look for the Necronomicon in the Library with Reason checks, or the Vault with Focus checks. Events also have a chance of advancing the Star Chartz The Academics win if they complete their goals before the last of them is killed, the Cultist wins if they kill all of the Academics. When the Star Chart reaches a certain number, the Cultist may reveal themselves to gain some horrid benefit. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth, all players know that the Cultist is trying to get the Star Chart to either 15 so they can reveal themselves to be a Mi-Go in a human costume, or 20 so they can summon a trio of Night Gaunts, or 25 so they can summon a Shoggoth. All players know these are the options, but only the Cultist knows which one they are actually trying to do.&#10;&#10;Cultists of Cthulhu is a big-box, semicooperative, thematic game of mystery, investigation, teamwork, and betrayal. The board is modular, and assembled at the beginning of each game in a rapid-fire, real-time setup.

If they don't, it hits, and their Mech takes damage! Continue until only one Mech (or team) is left standing.&#10;&#10;All cards have an energy cost. You have 8 energy to spend on every player's turn, but you also have the option to &quot;burn&quot; any or all of your 8 energy.
