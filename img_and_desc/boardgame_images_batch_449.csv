The goal of Crappy Birthday is to get people talking, laughing, and having a good time as quickly as possible. Don't be surprised if some people dislike the same gift that other people at the table love, because the gifts were designed to start fun and interesting conversations.  Crappy Birthday is simple enough that a group of non-gamers can read the rules and start playing within a few minutes.  Or if people do not want to play at the party, they can have fun by simply looking at the cards and laughing at the pictures and funny concepts.&#10;&#10;So the next time you are going to a party with non-gamers, consider bringing Crappy Birthday as a gift.&#10;&#10;"

The better the card, the less information you have about what suit it is.  That ability to look into the future gives the game its shape, and presents some unique challenges for the veteran card player.&#10;&#10;Foresight is also an engaging trick-taking card game, using that special set of cards.  The bidding system is at once familiar, a simple system of bidding how many tricks you are going to take, and different, in that you get to bid multiple times.  As befits a game with as much uncertainty as Foresight features, you get to place several bets, rather than be locked down into one bid.  And once play begins, part of your hand is obscured even from you.  Managing your information and your crucial hole cards is a skill that is unique to playing Foresight, and it&rsquo;s a fresh challenge that card players everywhere can appreciate.&#10;&#10;"

88605,,"Tilting dice&#10;by James Ryan&#10;&#10;Tilting dice is a two-player abstract strategy game designed for use with Nestortiles. Players construct a modular board and then strategically position their dice to make a capture. When two dice connect, the die with the highest facing side wins.&#10;&#10;SET UP:&#10;&#10;1) The board:&#10;Each player picks two colors of Nestortiles and takes all the tiles of those colors. The rest of the tiles are shuffled face down and patched together into a 6x6 grid. The grid is flipped over, revealing the pattern of pips. This will be used as the game board.&#10;&#10;2) The dice:&#10;Players now use their twelve Nestortiles to assemble two dice in any way they please.&#10;&#10;3) Placing the dice on the board:&#10;Players now place their dice in the corners of their own side of the game board with any side face up, so long as it does not match the number of the tile the die is on. Who ever is start player should place his or her dice first, giving the second player a chance to evaluate the position and place his or her dice accordingly.&#10;&#10;Example: In one of Eva's corners, there is a tile with four pips. She may place either of her dice in this corner, so long as it is not showing 4 pips on its top face. Once she places both of her dice, it will be Nestor's turn to place his. Then Eva will make the first move.&#10;&#10;Players may decide turn order in any manner they like. Start player will alternate each round.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;The first player to &quot;capture&quot; one of the other player's dice wins the round. First player to win 3 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;1) Moving dice:&#10;When players take their turns, they move one of their dice three times. Moving a die means &quot;tilting&quot; it on to the next space forward, backward, left, or right, so that the top face of the die becomes the side facing that direction.&#10;&#10;Example: Eva will play first. She decides to move her die that shows a green 5 on top. First, she will move it one space forward. Eva now tilts the die forward so that the green 5 faces forward and the die rests squarely on the next tile forward.&#10;&#10;Now this same die shows a blue 2 on top and she wants to move this one space to the left. She tilts the die to the left so that the blue 2 is now the side facing left and the die lands squarely on the next tile to the left..&#10;&#10;Now this die has a blue 5 on top, and Eva wants to move it one more space forward, so she tilts the die forward, moving the die onto the next tile forward so that his blue 5 faces forward, toward her opponent. Eva's turn is turn is now over.&#10;&#10;At no point during a player's turn may they move their die back onto a tile it has already touched during the same turn. This means players cannot retrace their path or repeat moves during the same turn.&#10;&#10;Dice may not be moved diagonally. Dice may not be rotated.&#10;&#10;2) Making a capture:&#10;When two opposing dice are in adjacent squares, their facing sides are compared. The die with the highest value on its facing side captures the other and the round is over.&#10;&#10;Example: One of Nestor's dice shows a 4 on one side. Eva is able to move her die so that it ends on the space adjacent to this side with a value of 5 facing Nestor's 4. Eva's 5 beats Nestor's 4, so Eva wins the round.&#10;&#10;Dice cannot be captured &quot;in passing.&quot; In other words, the sides of dice are not compared for a capture unless a player has completed all three moves of his or her turn. If dice are in adjacent squares on the first or second move of a turn, there is no comparison of sides and no capture.&#10;&#10;Sometimes, a die will end a turn on a &quot;matching&quot; tile. A die is said to be on a matching tile when its top face is of the same value as the tile. When a die is on a matching tile, all of its outward facing sides double in value for as long as the die remains on the matching tile. This means it may capture a die showing a side of greater value than it would normally be able to capture.&#10;&#10;Example: One of Eva's dice is on a matching space, and its outward facing sides show values of 2, 3, 4, and 4. Because she is on a matching tile, their values are now 4, 6, 8, and 8. As soon as she moves off the tile, their values will return to normal.&#10;&#10;Let's say Eva ended her turn on a matching tile that is adjacent to one of Nestor's dice. His die shows a 6 facing hers, and her die shows a 4 facing his. Ordinarily Eva would lose the round in this position, but because she is on a matching tile, the value of her 4 doubles to an 8. Her 8 beats Nestor's 6 and she wins the round.&#10;&#10;If dice are compared for capture and their values are equal, no capture takes place on that turn.&#10;&#10;STARTING A NEW ROUND&#10;&#10;Once a capture has been made, players collect their dice and prepare for a new round. Players should decide before a game begins whether or not they want the ability to remake their dice between rounds. Unless otherwise stated, dice should retain their composition for the duration of the game, and the board should likewise remain intact for all 3-5 rounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has won three rounds and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The game dates back to the turn of the 18th century and is based on xiangqi and go as well as shogi. Credit for its invention has been given to Confucian scholar Ogy&#197;&#171; Sorai. Unlike standard shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured. Promotion rules are complex, and the fates of several pieces are interdependent. The objective is to capture the opponent's commanding pieces: The general, plus the governor if present, or either the banner or middle army if not. Two players, Black and White, play on a go board ruled into a grid of 19 ranks (rows) by 19 files (columns) with a total of 361 intersections. Each player has a set of 90 pieces of 34 different types. The pieces are round and flattened like go stones. In all, the players must remember 65 different moves. The pieces are generally of the same size, though black pieces may be slightly larger than white pieces. Each piece has its name in the form of one or two Japanese characters marked on its face, in white on black stones and in black on white stones. On the reverse side of most pieces are other characters in red; this side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. - Wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi)&#10;&#10;"

To begin with eaxh player has 3 ghouls, these are; fast, good at searching but weak in combat. During each turn the players will raise a skeleton and a zombie to supplement their force. So more figures will enter play as the game progresses. The turn order is determined randomly by pulling stones from a bag. There are six stones, one for each player and the other two represent the resurrection of skeleton &amp; zombie. When a players stone is drawn, they are allowed to move all their figures. No diagonal movement is allowed, nor are you allowed to enter a space occupied by other players pieces, and finally there's a stcking limit of 4 figures per area. After moving any figures against to an enemy must fight (this is compulsory), otherwise they may search for artifacts. Specially prepared dice are used for both searching &amp; combat. These dice have the following faces; 2 x swords, 1 x shield, 2 x eye and 1 x swirl. During searching a number of dice are rolled, if any show the 'eye' the item has been found and will need to be carried back to the Necromancer in order to be used or scored. In combat, both players roll their respective dice, lokking for swords or shields. Basically a shield will negate a sword, any any excess swords on either side will kill a minion each. Spells can be played to influence the outcome of a battle ie 'Battle rage' - All swirls count as swords, thereby increasing your chance of killing your opponents figures.&#10;&#10;zombies are slow, not good in searching but the best fighters, skeletons are average across the board. The Necromancer himself, is very good at searching, but otherwise similar to a skeleton.Points are awarded for kills and for collecting items. The first player to acquire 25 points wins. Sets of gems are worth more than singles, scrolls give you another spell but are not worth any points, relics are worth 2 points, the chest is 4 (this is placed in the centre of the board) and potions are worth 1 but can be used in combat to roll an extra die.

The mechanism is a simple &quot;play one card, draw one card&quot;. The cards have events printed on them, with each event either influencing the own track (with some choices to make) or that of another player.

The game can be played by two, three or four players and the size of the hand varies with the number of players.&#10;&bull; Two players get 14 jangles each, with two jangles left over.&#10;&bull; Three players get 9 jangles each, with three jangles left over.&#10;&bull; Four players get 7 jangles each, with two jangles left over.&#10;In the case of three left over jangles, one is put away out of the game and not exposed, to leave two jangles in the starter. The starter is the pair of left over jangles. These are turned face up and put side by side to make a square in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;Jangles are placed on the table, vertically or horizontally, played out from the starter square. The idea is to build a &ldquo;crossword puzzle&rdquo; grid of repeated color patterns in the rows and columns.&#10;&#10;Any set of two or more adjacent jangles ending in a row or column is called a group. The jangles must be played so that the bells in each group form a (repeating) pattern. The possible patterns are:&#10;&#10;&bull; a single color repeated, example: red, red, red or&#10;&bull; two colors alternating, example: red, blue, red, blue, red, blue or&#10;&bull; three colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow or&#10;&bull; four colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, red, blue, yellow, green or&#10;&bull; or all five colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, red, blue, yellow, green, purple&#10;As soon as a group has a repeated color in it, or contains all five colors, the pattern for that group is fixed, and future jangles that extend the group must conform to the established pattern. As the layout grows, it is possible for a row or column to contain two or more groups, separated by spaces.&#10;&#10;Each jangle must be placed so that it correctly extends two or more groups, but you are not allowed to create a set of four jangles side by side in the layout, touching along their long sides.&#10;&#10;If a player thinks he cannot play, he exposes his hand. The other players can then (if they wish) point out any plays he might not have seen. In this case the player must play a tile. If more than one possible play is pointed out, the player has the option of picking the one he likes. If no play is pointed out, then the player scores zero and places no jangle. He is not out of the game, but has to wait for his next turn to see if he can then find a play.&#10;&#10;The game ends one of two ways: 1) When one player places all his jangles. The other players who started after him get to place one more jangle, however. 2) When no player can place a jangle.&#10;&#10;Scores are counted and added as the jangles are placed. Each bell on a jangle is worth 5 points, The score is the product of the new lengths of all extended groups. If the jangle used to extend the group is a double, then the score is also doubled.&#10;&#10;All players lose points for the jangles remaining in their hands when the game is ended. Doubles are -5 points and all other jangles are -25 points.&#10;&#10;"

88844,,"Cuboid is a game of skill for two players, to be played with a set of NestorTiles.  The colours of the tiles are significant, but the numbers are ignored.&#10;&#10;Each player builds a creature (the Oid) by assembling 6 differently coloured tiles to make a cube.&#10;&#10;The remaining 48 tiles are shuffled, and put together randomly to make a 7x7 board, with one gap in the centre.&#10;&#10;Starting with the second player, each player puts their opponent's Oid on the board, in an orientation of their choice.&#10;&#10;The game begins.  In each turn, players perform the following actions, in order, for each Oid they have on the board:&#10;&#10;Eating: if the colour on top of the Oid matches the colour of their tile, the Oid eats that tile.&#10; Movement: the Oid moves in any orthogonal direction, by (a) sliding over any number of adjacent empty spaces, then (b) rolling onto the first tile it encounters. Oids cannot move onto or past other Oids.&#10;&#10;Breeding: if the player's Oids have eaten six tiles, they breed.  Assemble a new Oid, and have the opponent place it on the board next to an adjacent Oid.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more moves are possible.  The player with the most tiles, either as parts or in Oids, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Cuboid is an entry in the 1st Nestortiles competition, here:&#10;http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/580556/1st-nestortiles-game-design-contest-by-nestorgames&#10;&#10;Source: author&#10;&#10;"

A few cards have an ongoing effect - like the Fortress and the Cityguard.&#10;&#10;There are three types of cards: characters, buildings and rebellions. Each player can play one character card, one building card and any number of rebellion cards on his turn.&#10;&#10;When the last card is drawn from the playdeck the game ends.
