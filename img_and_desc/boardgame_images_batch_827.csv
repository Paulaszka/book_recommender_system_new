Germany and its allies had almost five million men deployed in three army groups along the 800 miles of the Soviet border. As dawn broke on 22 June 1941, the first Axis formations crossed into the Soviet Union and smashed through units charged with defending the border. Taken completely by surprise, many were captured or killed while asleep in their barracks.  As the dawn bled into a new day, the Luftwaffe bombed airfields in western Russia destroying much of the Soviet air force on the ground, and German bombers attacked cities from Riga in the north to Odessa in the south.&#10; The invasion had achieved a total strategic surprise. At first, Stalin and the Soviet High Command were in a state of denial.  It was many hours before they accepted the reality of the situation and started issuing orders allowing local commanders to re-group and mount counterattacks.  Their paralysis only added to the chaos and confusion of the Soviet units at the front. It looked as though Hitler&rsquo;s confident prophesy to his generals was going to be realised: &ldquo;You have only to kick in the door, and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.&rdquo; &#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;But it didn&rsquo;t. Four months later, the Soviets were still fighting tenaciously and the character of the war had changed. In sight of Moscow, the Axis blitzkrieg had run its course: a war of manoeuvre and mobility had become war of attrition; a bloody slog as autumnal rains heralded rasputitsa and roads became quagmires. The vision of a rapid victory envisaged by Hitler had vanished.  &#10;  &#10;The historical outcome of Operation Barbarossa was the consequence of fateful decisions and extraneous events which conspired to produce a campaign unsurpassed in drama or scale.  We hope Storm in the East: Operation Barbarossa does justice to History by presenting players with  difficult strategic problems and choices which faced the Axis and Soviet High Commands, and to Reality by demonstrating that the historical result was only one of a number of equally plausible outcomes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Sometimes players resolve these orders alone, and sometimes cooperating with, or in conflict with, other guild's adventuring teams attempting the same thing at the same time.

Negotiation over shared goals, contract bonuses and reward splits is encouraged and rewarding, but not absolutely required to win.&#10;&#10;Everything you do earns you fame (victory points) and other rewards. At the end of nine rounds, any remaining coins are converted to fame at a rate of 5 coins = 1 fame. Then any special prestige upgrade fame is added.

Master New Galaxies in Your Quest to Construct a Quantum Computer!&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Quantum Universe, Captain!&#10;&#10;Congratulations, your captain has retired and left you in charge of his galactic shipping business! Now it&rsquo;s time to make some upgrades as you embark on a journey to reconstruct a quantum computer developed by an ancient race.&#10;&#10;Entanglion is a cooperative board game designed for two players. Learn about quantum computing as you work together with your teammate to navigate the three galaxies of the quantum universe, avoid detection by the defense mechanisms left behind by the ancients, and rebuild the quantum computer.&#10;&#10;Think you&rsquo;re up for the challenge?&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;Entanglion is a cooperative board game designed for two players. The goal is to reconstruct a quantum computer developed by an ancient race. Work together with your teammate to navigate the three galaxies of the quantum universe &ndash; Centarious, Superious, and Entanglion &ndash; in a quest to collect eight quantum computer components. Be careful to avoid detection by the planetary defense mechanisms guarding the components!&#10;&#10;Game concepts&#10;Entanglion was designed to expose players to several fundamental concepts in quantum computing:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computation.&#10;     Superposition is when a quantum system may exist in a probabilistic combination of multiple states at once.&#10;     Entanglement happens when the state of one qubit correlates with the state of another qubit.&#10;     Measurement is the process of observing the classical value of a qubit.&#10;     Error happens when random noise in the quantum system perturbs the measured value of a qubit.&#10;&#10;&#10;Entanglion also exposes players to the different kinds of hardware and software components involved in building a real quantum computer.&#10;&#10;Turn overview&#10;Perform one of the following actions on your turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Navigate. Play one engine card in engine control to navigate around the galaxy, and draw a replacement. You may only play engine cards for your own ship.&#10;     Exchange. Discard one engine card from your hand and draw a replacement..&#10;     Retrieve. Roll the Entanglion die to attempt to retrieve a quantum component if one is present.&#10;     Event. Play an event card from your hand (if you possess one).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players may not pass their turns, they must perform one of the actions above.&#10;&#10;Detection rate&#10;The detection rate determines the difficulty of successfully evading planetary defenses. The detection rate token is used to keep track of the current detection rate. When a player&rsquo;s spaceship has been detected by orbital defenses, or a player&rsquo;s away team has been detected by ground defenses, the detection rate is increased, making it easier for each planet&rsquo;s defenses to detect the player in the future. The game ends when the detection rate reaches the final level (designated with an X).&#10;&#10;Orbital defenses&#10;Planets in Entanglion are protected by orbital defenses that scan for ships looking to plunder the quantum components hidden there. It is possible to evade these defenses using your quantum engines. If you are detected, however, your navigation system will automatically take evasive maneuvers and jump to a random planet in the Centarious system. This jump triggers a quantum event.&#10;&#10;Game end&#10;Players immediately win the game when they have collected all eight components of the quantum computer. Players immediately lose the game when the detection rate reaches the end (X).&#10;&#10;"

It's other names are &quot;The Fan&quot;, &quot;Three Shuffles and a Draw&quot;, &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, and/or &quot;Trefoil&quot;.&#10;&#10;It's a single player card game where the point of the game is to transfer all cards from the tableau to the four foundations. The only action taken by the player will be moving a card from one &quot;fan&quot; of many, to another one in descending order (e.g. 7 of clubs on top of 8 of clubs)&#10;&#10;From the start all cards are visible in the tableau, but this doesn't mean the game can be won with strategy. More times than not, the game will not be beat because of unlucky draws. Such as kings being the top card of fans, or higher cards being on the bottom of the fan while the higher card of that suit is on top of the fan.&#10;&#10;"

The cards help you avoid or diminish your opponents ability to avoid the Nooo! cards, which otherwise eliminate you unless you have one of the escape cards which require you to complete a comical consequence (ie: you may need to breathe like Darth Vader or talk like Yoda for the rest of the game). Use other action cards such as Carbon Freeze!, Trust the Force, and Jedi Mind Trick, to outsmart your opponent and disrupt their next move.

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, conditions, and (for some characters) curses. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.&#10;&#10;One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations.

If a point is touching more then 1 scoring icon you get that point for each scoring icon.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;You must play 1 card on your turn. All cards have values in the 4 corners.&#10;You must play your card on top of another players as long as your number is higher. The first player each round will play a card to start the round.&#10;4 cards have scoring icons. The scoring icons have no point value but can cover any number! However, the scoring icons cannot be covered.&#10;You CAN&rsquo;T play over your own cards, 2 corners, or 2 cards.
