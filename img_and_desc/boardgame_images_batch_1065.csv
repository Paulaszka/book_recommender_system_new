On a turn, you take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;1) Announce your character: Claim the power of a certain character and take the associated action. You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.&#10;&#10;2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.&#10;&#10;3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins &mdash; or until a player has lost all of their coins, in which case the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Mascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game. The rules suggest that you use certain characters in your first games, but once you know the game, you can try many other distributions.&#10;&#10;Note that this second edition of Mascarade includes 17 role cards, with these cards being a mix of roles from the original base game and the 2014 expansion.&#10;&#10;"

Each die has a different color on each of its six sides. Once you stop, you can use the die results to X spaces on your game board, but only if you can X off all the spaces in that group. If you roll four orange and one red, for example, you can X off a group of two, three, or four orange hexagons, but not a group of five orange hexagons since you have only four orange on the dice.&#10;&#10;After you take your turn, each other player can X off one space on their game board for each die that you didn't use on your turn &mdash; but only if those spaces are adjacent to ones that are already Xed.

When a player can&rsquo;t take a movement or an action, they must pass. When all players pass, the board is cleared of energy and the race to planets and resources begins again.&#10;&#10;At the end of the third round, the game ends and you total up your victory points from machine upgrades, explored exoplanets, secret objectives, and resources.

It indicates who bid and how many hands they bid. The rules also mention 21 tokens/coins. These are used for tracking the score. Use any tokens you prefer or keep track of the score with paper and pencil.&#10;&#10;I recommend keeping a copy of the card distribution (the last page of the rulebook) out in front of players. It helps players keep track of the unconventional distribution of the cards among the suits.&#10;&#10;I really hope you enjoy the game. It's small and quick, but it has some depth in the play. If you're familiar with Euchre, it's a bit like a 3-player version in which one player always goes alone.&#10;&#10;It's a nice filler for when you're waiting for other players to arrive.&#10;&#10;"

His grandson Charlemagne invaded Germany, Spain, and Italy and in 800 CE was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III, reviving the Western Roman Empire. Like its predecessor the Frankish Empire slowly fell apart, divided by civil war, and devastated by Norse and Magyar raiders. The last Carolingian ruler died in 987 CE and the empire split into warring kingdoms.&#10;&#10;Two players may play Rome, LLC. one controlling the Eastern Byzantine Empire and the other the Western Frankish Empire. The Byzantines have the larger, wealthier, empire, but their enemies are more dangerous. The weaker economy of the Franks makes them more dependent on allies and marcher lords to guard the frontier and must expand their kingdom into an empire. Each plays their own game side-by-side, with their own statesmen and units, co-operating against invading Arabs, Avars, Bulgars, Magyars, Moors, Norse, Rus, Saxons, Seljuks, and Slavs. The game may be played solitaire, with the player either controlling one empire, or both at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each empire has its own statesmen who are made emperors, kings, governors, or rebels. They are rated for their military, administration, religion, and intrigue abilities, and each has a special ability. St Boniface reformed the Frankish Church and the evangelist of Germany, so is a Western Statesman with 1 Military ability, 4 Administration ability, 5 Religious ability, 2 Intrigue ability, and the Convert special ability.&#10;&#10;The map has provinces grouped into commands with their own governors, who collects taxes, quells insurgents, fights wars, but may assassinate their emperor or rebel and start a civil war. Emperors counters are used to change commands and rules and determine which statesmen of the new dynasty will become emperor, regardless of their abilities (or lack thereof).&#10;Cavalry, Guards, Auxilia, Forts, and Fleets are used to fight wars and garrison provinces, with some provinces held by allies or marcher lords to protect the frontier from barbarians. Enemy leaders and wars move from province to province until defeated, encouraging revolts, and shrink the empires. Fighting a war may result in a triumph, which removes the war, increases prestige, reduces unrest, generates gold, and annexes provinces, but may also lead to a disaster or bloody stalemate.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by winning Prestige, which is earned by imperial administration, annexing provinces, defeating wars, and financing prestige projects. The loss of both Constantinople and Rome to the barbarians results in defeat, but bankruptcy and unrest can also drive an empire to destruction.&#10;&#10;Rome, LLC. uses the system from Rome, Inc. (ATO 53). Each turn represents 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each scenario. The five scenarios start in 610 CE, 711 CE, 814 CE, 888 CE, and 973 CE which may be combined into campaign games. Players may continue the scenarios from Rome, Inc. and Rome, IInc. into Rome, LLC. allowing them to play 17 consecutive scenarios covering 1500 years of history.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

When a player has 3-4 complete boards, at least one of which contains 7+ cards, they can choose to end the game. If that doesn't happen before the deck runs out, the game ends at that point.

Lasca), a variant of the Checkers Family, in 1911. The game board and play resembles that of Checkers, but captured pieces remain on the board and can possibly be freed later in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game on the 7x7 board with eleven soldiers. On a turn, a player moves one soldier diagonally forward one space. If a capture is available, then the player must make that capture, trapping the captured piece underneath the capturing one; if the newly captured piece had previously had one or more pieces underneath it, then those pieces are now free to move in future turns. If a soldier reaches the opponent's back row, it's flipped and promoted to an officer, which can move diagonally in all directions.

When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.  If yours, it stays there; if not, it reverts to its indistinguishable side and its true owner must move it on his next turn.  During play, you can also challenge the ownership of a piece being moved.  The incorrect player forfeits his turn.&#10;&#10;"

Players roll the six dice, and can hold two and re-roll the rest.&#10;&#10;The decks include Barrage cards for bullet hell, which can be used offensively or defensively.
