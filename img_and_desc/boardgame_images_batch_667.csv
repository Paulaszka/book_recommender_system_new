Players wishing to play must play the same number and type of meld, but higher ranking (e.g. a pair of fours above a pair of threes) or they may pass. It is not compulsory to play cards if a player can do so. Play continues until all players pass. The last person who played can then proceed again with any meld he chooses. If the player who played last goes out (and all the other players have passed) then the player to his left proceeds.&#10;&#10;The dealer shuffles the cards and deals them to his left (any cutting of the cards is entirely optional and is left to the choice of the dealer).

This game is a simplified version of the German game Skat - in that the trumps are fixed (always hearts), but the ranking is still the same:&#10;A-10-K-Q-J-9-8-7.&#10;&#10;Depending on how many players you have, you reduce the 32 card deck further.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Players&#10;&#10;         Cards In Deck&#10;&#10;         # Dealt to each player&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         5&#10;&#10;         32 (7 -&gt; A)&#10;&#10;         6&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         4&#10;&#10;         30 (remove 7&hearts; &amp; 7&diams;)&#10;&#10;         7&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         3&#10;&#10;         26 (remove all 7's + 8&hearts; &amp; 8&diams;)&#10;&#10;         8&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         2&#10;&#10;         20 (10 -&gt; A)&#10;&#10;         9&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns after dealing to see if they want to make a go of a play.  Goal of making a go at it is to get 66 or more points in the tricks you capture.  If you make 66, you get your wager (fixed, say 1 pt).  If you make a go and fail to get 66 pts you loose 2x wager (say -2 pts). If you make a go and fail to get more than 33, you loose 4x the wager (say -8 pts). If you make a go and succeed and keep the sum of everyone else to 33 or below, you win 3x the wager (say 3 pts).&#10;&#10;The points are: A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2, and 7,8,9 =0.&#10;So there are 120 points on offer, and you need to capture 66 of them.  Remember the 10 is better than the king, and there are rules for using trumps and playing trumps and suits - so if you don't think you can make it, pass the option to make a play to the next person.  If the question to play goes around the table fully and no one takes it, its a bust and reshuffle ( There is no Skat like option of playing with a crappy hand).&#10;&#10;Once cards are dealt there will be 2 cards left over - leave those face down.  Whomever makes a play, gets to draw those 2 card into their hand and discard 2 cards, to set aside.  Those set-aside cards count in the scoring of the player  making a play.  So its important what you discard - consider the rules of when suits and trumps need to be played.&#10;&#10;First player left of the dealer plays first card (regardless of who decided to make a go of it this hand).  You have to play the suit led with, if you have it.  If you don't have it, but have hearts, you must trump with a heart (your choice which).  If you don't have hearts either, play any card - but you won't get that trick.  If hearts is the first card played, you MUST play hearts if you have it and you MUST play a higher heart if you can.&#10;&#10;This way, you can see that its possible to force others to play hearts at certain times and get the trump cards out of play, and then still control play and be able to bring home points with less valuable cards like face-cards.&#10;&#10;It sounds very complex, but its not nearly as bad as it seems, and a great light version of Skat.  Unlike Skat that requires exactly 3 players, this plays with 2-5 players.&#10;&#10;"

The goal is to build up the combination that will grant them the most victory points. Some cards grant points on their own, while others require the same type of cards to earn more points.&#10;&#10;2] Judgement: All players place their five trait cards in front of them in two rows: two face down and three face up to show the cards they chose. Give the information available, the Overseers then discuss which player has the strongest possible combination. After deliberating, players vote for this person using their token. The chosen player must then admit or deny the verdict:&#10;&#10;&mdash; If they admit having the strongest combination, they must then discard two cards from their combination.&#10;&mdash; If they deny this, the showdown phase happens, with all players revealing their scores. If the chosen player has the strongest combination, they lose the two cards that grant the most points; if not, instead they take one additional card of their choice from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;3] Scoring: Each player shows all cards in front of them, then calculates their score.&#10;&#10;The game might have other phases depending on the type of overseers being played as each character has special abilities that can change the outcome of the game, such as being able to peek at another player's hidden cards, steal a card before the scoring phase, or transform one card into another.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players secret their victory point (VP) tokens to keep their score secret, and after three rounds whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;"

These modifiers result from their skills, special training or cyberations and other equipment. The rules do not use any dice and the testing mechanics are based on cards that we call CanDo.

They are: The King, The Warrior, The Wizard, The Queen, The Goblin and The Villagers.&#10;&#10;This game creates several unique strategies. Do you choose items or characters that you can stack up to ensure victory, but at the risk of letting your opponent have automatic victory points because you cannot engage in every battle? Or will you go with special characters like the wizard who have a high probability of victory on their own? Or will you use special items to gain the advantage by increasing your attributes or peeking at the other players cards before you have to make a decision. The choice is yours, but choose wisely, because every decision you make will lead to victory or your untimely demise.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;The 8 character cards are shuffled and placed between the two players, face down. Each player draws two cards, then decides which of the two to keep and which to put back. Shuffle and repeat until there are only two character cards left.  These two cards are randomly distributed.&#10;&#10;Repeat these steps for the item cards except stop once each player has three item cards.

Each Player creates a Player Soldier during the Napoleonic Wars. The Player Soldiers will attempt to gain Merit Points in order to advance in rank throughout various Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Player Soldiers can be assigned to a Cavalry or Infantry Regiment serving in the British or French Armies. This game is especially suited for fans of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe Series, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Brigadier Gerard Series and Richard Howard's Alain Lausard series.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;The Objective of the Game is to have your Soldier be the first to complete his Career during the Napoleonic Wars. Career Progress is tracked by moving your Soldier&rsquo;s Counter along the Game Board&rsquo;s Career Track. The Career Track consists of Garrison Duty and Campaign Duty Assignments. These Assignments will result in a variety of situations and encounters including Skirmishes, Patrols, Battles, Encampment, Headquarters, Siege Assaults and Special Missions in which the Player&rsquo; Soldier must resolve. The outcome of these Encounters and Situations determine whether the Player&rsquo;s Soldier advances along the Career Track. While the Soldiers conduct Challenges, they might gain or lose Merit Points, which are used to improve their Attribute Ratings and Rank. The Player Soldier with the Highest Rank after reaching the Ending Space on the Career Track, is the Winner. If this is tied, then the Soldier with the most Merit Points remaining is the Winner. If this is tied then the Soldiers may conduct a Duel to determine the Winner.&#10;&#10;"

Bloody Big Battles! (BBB) does exactly what its title says. It is intended for fighting the biggest, bloodiest battles of 1850-1900 in a manageable way. Specific design goals included:&#10;to tackle the major battles such as Solferino, Gettysburg, K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz, Sedan or Plevna, often spanning several days&rsquo; combat;&#10;to fit them on a 6&rsquo;x4&rsquo; tabletop;&#10;and to fight them in their entirety, in a single 3-to-4-hour session, with 2-6 players (typically 4).&#10;&#10;BBB is not intended for small actions of a few thousand men a side. There are plenty of rulesets that do that. But BBB is distinctive in:&#10;Enabling players to command entire armies of 100,000+ men;&#10;Fitting battlefields of up to 20km across on the table;&#10;While still producing a fast, fun, flavorful game and a result in an evening.&#10;&#10;Scale varies according to the battle but is typically:&#10;Figure scale 1,500 men or 36 cannon per 1&rdquo; base (organized into multi-base division or brigade-sized units, usually of 3-7 infantry bases, 2-3 cavalry bases or 1 artillery base);&#10;Ground scale 1&rdquo; per 200-250 yards;&#10;Timescale 1 hour per turn.&#10;&#10;BBB uses simple mechanisms and memorisable tables that fit on a clear 2-page QRC.&#10;Turn sequence: IGO-UGO&#10;Command and Control: reflected partly by how many generals get represented on table, partly by how units are rated.&#10;Movement: 2D6 movement table incorporates difficult terrain, generalship and doctrine, troop quality and morale, loss recovery.&#10;Fire Combat: calculated by adding fire points. 2D6 fire table to determine casualties, recorded by base removal.&#10;Assault: opposed D6 roll incorporating a few relevant factors.&#10;Night Interval rules to allow multi-day battles.&#10;&#10;BBB is meant for fighting historical battles. BBB and its companion volume, Bloody Big European Battles, therefore provide fully playtested scenarios for 25 of the most important battles of the period, linked into full campaigns. Further free scenarios are also available on the web.&#10;&#10;All the scenarios fit the battles they depict into a beautiful, tightly engineered game structure. They have clear, simple, but carefully thought-out victory conditions, designed both to recreate the historical situation and to generate an exciting and balanced game that can be completed in a sensible period of time. A particular joy of fighting historical actions on this scale is that usually both sides have several different viable strategies available, meaning the scenarios are full of replay value and can produce quite different games each time.&#10;&#10;"

Depending on a few modular game mechanics, it can take anywhere from 1-3 hours to play.&#10;&#10;In the game, you are a group of specialists sent to terraform a new planet, and the survival of the human race depends on you. On the last day of your mission, your shuttle was destroyed. This left you stranded on a planet that is about to be transformed, killing you but terraformimg humanity's new home. At that moment, you realized the planet was already inhabited by a shape-shifting alien race, and it's natives won't give up without a fight.&#10;&#10;The game is broken up into two phases, a morning and an evening. In the morning, players take actions to repair equipment and maintain the group's health and sanity. In the evening, players discuss a course of action. Those two phases make up a day, and players only have a few days to root out the aliens that have infiltrated the group.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the shuttle is repaired and players vote to leave. If all people on board are human, humans win. But, if humans failed to test enough players, and even one hidden alien is on board... Aliens win.&#10;&#10;And to make the game even more panic ridden, each in game location is in a different real world location. That means that every morning, things are happening in secret; and you have to judge for yourself if the other players are lying or telling the truth. Two humans may go to a location, but if one is a hidden alien, two aliens might come back. Without developing tests and merciless interrogation, you will never know.&#10;&#10;Only trust what you've seen with your own eyes, because even the most helpful human might be an alien vying for a seat on the shuttle.&#10;&#10;"
