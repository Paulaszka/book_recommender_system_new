After some fighting and hissing Schrodinger finally manages to put the cat into the box and to close it. Happy that the struggle is over he proudly announces that from now on no one is able to know if the cat is dead or alive as long as nobody looks into the box. Schrodinger orders you and your colleagues assistants to watch the box and take notes. An so you do for hours and hours&hellip;&#10;&#10;Finally, you have had enough. You turn towards your fellow colleagues, announcing that you will wager your position of first assistant to whoever is able to make the best guess on whether the cat is already dead and how long ago it died. Enthusiastically, everybody agrees, however you have a plan: to sneak into the laboratory at night and risk a peek into the box to make sure the most suitable candidate gets the title of first assistant. After all, who else would be more suitable than you?&#10;&#10;In Dead Cat you try to guess how long the cat in the box is already dead. When it's your turn you have two options: you can either look into the box or you announce that the cat is dead.&#10;&#10;If you decide to look into the box you take a card from the box deck, look at it without showing it to your opponent and put it on top of the time deck. After that you have to change your bet. Take the your betting die and change it to another site. You choose which one as long as it is not the same as before.&#10;&#10;If you decide to announce the death of the cat the round ends and you start revealing cards from the top of the time deck until you find a dead cat or there are no cards left. In the first case the player with the closest bet to the amount of revealed cards wins the round, in the latter case the player with the highest bet. In case of a tie both player receive a point.&#10;&#10;You play until one player gets 4 points.&#10;&#10;"

Special Points can be spent to purchase special Benefits.&#10;&#10;When a fight occurs, the attacking Model rolls a number of dice equal to the Impact value of their weapon. The number to meet or exceed to score a Hit is based on the character&rsquo;s Ability. For each Hit inflicted, the target gets a Save roll based on their Protection value. Each unsaved Hit results in a Suppression or a Wound.&#10;Suppressions impair the target; Wounds get the character closer to be removed from the game.&#10;&#10;After all Models in a Unit have resolved their Active and/or Partial Activations, another Unit activates. Activations continue this way until all Units have acted. At that point tokens that do not apply anymore are removed from the play area, and a new turn is started.&#10;&#10;"

Each hexagon on both maps represents 20 miles (32.5 km) from side to opposite side. The system is based around the central idea that large First World armies (as well as those from elsewhere that have been trained and equipped to try to perform like First World armies) almost always begin major wars seemingly well prepared. Unfortunately for those in their front-line units, both the training and equipment usually only make them ready for the previous war, not the one they're about to fight. Beyond that, the initial period of such wars is characterized by only a partially abandoned peacetime psychology among the officers and enlisted. That is, no one as yet appreciates what it means operatively to be in an all-out war. All that comes together to give overall performance high-risk, volatile and fragile qualities: no one as yet really knows what's actually possible or wise to try to accomplish. Seemingly powerful units therefore easily become &quot;disrupted&quot;--especially as gauged in relation to similar units' performances later, after everyone's been thoroughly schooled in the art of war as it exists in the present. The system therefore doesn't play--when looked at on a step by step basis--in a way common to division-level simulations. The whole thing has a &quot;Go&quot; like quality to it. The commander will succeed best who--rather than reacting to or launching operations opportunistically one at a time--plans his campaign and then campaigns on that plan. Of course, we all know it's also true &quot;no plan survives first contact with the enemy.&quot; So, even as you plan, you must do so while leaving within your overall scheme at least some capacity for opportunism. Strategy is not simple; it is complex.&#10;&#10;The initiating change to history behind this game is as follows. Early in the spring of 1943, one of the historically failed assassination plots attempted against Hitler during that period actually succeeded. In short, that allowed the German high command to go over to a fully rationalized defense at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. Long story short: the Third Reich survived WW2 in truncated form (see the maps). The new rulers in Berlin soon thereafter set in place their own &quot;Warsaw Pact,&quot; an alliance among Germany, the Baltic republics, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Balkan countries north of Greece. The Allies reacted by creating NATO, which rump-Russia eagerly joined. By 1980, the same kind of rot that afflicted the USSR in our timeline began to set in within the Third Reich. Here, though, instead of initiating a German version of Perestroika and Glasnost, those ruling in Berlin decided to roll the dice on one all-out and final war for global domination. This game presents that war (or at least the two main theaters within it).&#10;&#10;The components to a complete boxed game of NNN2 include rules, two map-sheets, and three sheets of die-cut counters (also called &quot;units&quot; and &quot;unit counters&quot;). Dice and charts and tables are also included.&#10;&#10;"

Character eyeball cards are placed in front of players. These cards are used to determine eyeball damage.&#10;&#10;Deal 7 cards to each player. Each turn consists of playing a card and drawing a card. Some cards may be played during other players turns.&#10;&#10;Players can use legal moves, such as punch, block, and block and knock cards to damage opposing eyeballs.&#10;&#10;Players may also use illegal moves such as Swarm, Eye-fry, Steal, and Nap-time cards on opponents. But by using illegal moves, players run the risk of being fouled by Referee Cards played by opponents.&#10;&#10;Players win by either being the last eyeball standing or by building 3 complete hotdogs (a complete hotdog consists of 3 sets of Dawg, Bun, and Condiment cards).

This game is played with 9 cards that start face down in 3 rows of 3. At the beginning of game play one card is upturned (any card). On your turn you can take a new card from the draw pile or one that has already been discarded. There are cards ranging from -3 to 9, a few wild cards &amp; also a lose your turn &amp; a reverse order card. The object of the game is to have the least amount of points. If you get 3 cards in a row (diagonal, horizontal or vertical) all 3 cards count as 0 no matter what their face value. Game ends when one player has all 9 of their cards face up.&#10;&#10;"

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!&#10;&#10;During play, you must efficiently play the five cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon, allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can be defeated only with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.&#10;&#10;As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!&#10;&#10;This deck is a standalone dungeon complete with items, monsters, and a Boss &mdash; the glorious Gold King. This dungeon has hard hitting monsters and harder hitting swords.&#10;&#10;"

It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The suggested board sizes are between 7x7 and 10x10 points.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsTo flip a stone means to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must place a stone of their color on an empty point. If the placement is part of one or more uninterrupted orthogonal lines of stones made of&#10;&#10;a) two friendly stones and&#10;b) an uninterrupted line of enemy stones,&#10;&#10;said enemy stones are flipped. The two friendly stones can be both at one end of the enemy line or one at each end.&#10;&#10;x+oo ... +xoo ... +ooox ... +xxooo&#10;&#10;In the first three diagrams above, an x play at + flips the o stones; in the fourth diagram, it doesn't.&#10;&#10;When a placement fills the last empty point on the board, all enemy stones that would normally be flipped as a result of it are removed instead, after which the game ends.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the highest score in the final position. A player's score is the number of stones with their color showing that there are on the board, minus half a point for the player who made the last placement.&#10;&#10;"
