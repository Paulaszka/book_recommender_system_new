Team Yankee presents the expertise that the modern tank company commander needs in easy-to-follow game rules format.  Two players each form their own strategies as they fight out potential, very real situations on the battlefield of World War III.  Soviet units have numbers and firepower; U.S. units have speed and technology.  To each side's advantages and disadvantages the players add strategy and leadership.&#10;&#10;Rules cover the essentials of movement and combat between modern combat units.  On this foundation are built special rules covering artillery, morale, chemical warfare, air support, and the other special aspects of modern warfare.&#10;&#10;The game maps cover the same ground shown in the novel.  Eight game scenarios walk you through the rules, unveiling the effects of all the rules, and showing you in detail how to play the game.  In the course of playing the scenarios, you will be able to recreate the situations in the book (and perhaps alter their course).&#10;&#10;The rules chapter on variants lets players change the scenarios to add new rules and replay scenarios to see what effects they will have on the situation.

It is a bidding game. The new bidding system is: You have an auctioneer. He sells several open cards. He decides the selling order (one by one). The others make clockwise just one bid or no bid. The auctioneer can accept the highest bid, take the money, and sell the next card, or the auctioneer can take the card by himself, but then he is no longer the auctioneer (next clockwise is). If no one bids on something, the auctioneer must take the card (that can be hard because money is really short) - so you have to be careful what you sell.&#10;&#10;The cards you're bidding on are production places, technologies, resources, and improvements (bonus). After the bidding phase you can build production places and improvements and develop technologies, then you immediately get victory points. For that you need money and resources (mainly from other production places).&#10;&#10;Problem: If you build late (next period started) you get less or nothing.&#10;&#10;At the end you get extra points for good improvement combinations and production places that work together.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by: &#10;&#10;    Industry&#10;&#10;&#10;"

In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.&#10;&#10;The Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.&#10;&#10;Talvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the &ldquo;Red Finns&rdquo; seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvaj&auml;rvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a &ldquo;variable impulse&rdquo; game system to model the two armies&rsquo; very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army&rsquo;s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.&#10;&#10;Winter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data.

On the o&shy;ne hand it depends surely o&shy;n the fact that the Second World War is a very serious topic which of course does not simplify its realization in a card game, o&shy;n the other hand this very background requires the great historical precision and complexity that seemed difficult to achieve until now.&#10;&#10;The alphaBIT company from Hannover (Germany) takes charge of this problematic topic from now o&shy;n and excels by a balance of realism and subtle intuition. History of War (HoW) presents the Second World War solely as the tactical fight of units.  Retaliatory weapons, atom bombs or personal names like those of generals are deliberately excluded from the game.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is a conquest of land cards that should bring together 15 win points. A means to an end in this case are the mentioned units and the HoW really succeeded to bring together three large parts of a war: fight by land, by air and by sea.&#10;&#10;It makes the game truly particular as even computer games have difficulties in combining these three types of units. As a rule they are divided into land/air or sea/air. In History of War o&shy;n the contrary  the players can use all the units like infantry, tanks, artillery, fighters, bombers, submarines and cruisers in o&shy;ne and the same deck without problems. In addition just like in all other TCGs they can choose freely in a great card pool and make up their own deck.&#10;&#10;There appears another positive aspect  that would please first of all the players with not much means: there is no degree of rarity in HoW. All the cards of an edition are available exactly o&shy;nce in a set which means that a player knows what he buys and already with a few sets is equipped enough for a chosen side. The mentioning of the units provokes the question how they could be paid. The usual  principle in other TCGs  works here as well: some special cards provide the resources. These are called base improvements in HoW. These cards deliver not o&shy;nly the important  technical values (TVs) necessary for payment of units, action cards and effects, but they possess as well useful qualities, so that the mere choice of his base improvements has decisive  consequences for a player. The TVs deliver also the country improvements that can be placed directly in the countries and thus are imminently exposed to the attacks of the enemy, but then dispose of the interesting effects. The units paid with the TVs are played in the so-called deployment zone. The units have different attack and defense values for various areas like land, air and sea. The victory flags o&shy;n the unit cards necessary to conquer the countries are transformed into the win points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;More detailed and profound division of the values, ammunition consumption, moral and so o&shy;n known from other games were deliberately resigned to make a game easy-to handle. Such special characteristics of the units were replaced by useful abilities that make the game fluent and the rules clear. The final transformation of the units into win points is based o&shy;n historical accuracy.&#10;&#10;All the cards show the high quality pictures or even photos of the Second World War and the unit cards are enriched by engineering data. HoW is surely a must for lovers of strategy games, interesting and affordable o&shy;n top of that thanks to the absence of  degree of rarity.&quot;&#10;&#10;You can find lot of pictures and a rule discussion forum on their German webpage: www.history-of-war.com [you can change the webpage language clicking on the UK banner on the left, once in]&#10;&#10;"

The offensive player can move and pass the ball around, the defensive player move to block the offensive player, steal the ball, or block the shot. If the offensive player does not get a shot off by the end of the 3rd turn, its a turnover.&#10;&#10;The closer you are to the basket, the easier the shot. There are two ways to resolve shots, either a simple roll of the twelve-sided die, with longer shots being tougher, or by a little dexterity shot where you flick a basketball up on a slightly angled board, and try to get it in the basket.

The batter choosing to let the ball pass (if he thinks it'll be a ball), to bunt, or swing. To swing, he places the bat over 4 locations where he thinks the ball may end up. The pitcher then reveals the pitch, and rolls a die to see how many spaces and what direction the pitch moves to determine the final location of the pitch. Curve balls will move a few spaces inwards, a sinker downwards, and so on.&#10;&#10;If the ball is hit, the batter rolls a die, and adds a bonus based on which of the 4 locations he covered the ball was thrown to (he may have a +4 to any pitch thrown to the upper right location, but no bonus for the other three squares, for example).

8166,,"A boardgame based on a computer game (instead of the other way around) and designed by Klaus Teuber, Anno 1503 views the era of colonization strictly from the home country perspective. Two to four players send ships to explore islands scattered about a 5 x 12 square ocean (the more players, the  more islands). The settlement of the new lands is, however, strictly abstract.&#10;&#10;Each player's turn begins with the roll of one 6-sided die. A &quot;6&quot; is a random event (pirates, fire or good fortune - bad twice as often as lucky, and most likely to damage players who are doing well). On other results, each player gains a commodity from one of his five workshops. The player who rolled may then buy commodities from the bank, sell them to his colonists for gold (no trading among players), or use them in various combinations to recruit new colonists, promote existing ones, or build ships. After that, ships can sail for the unknown lands.&#10;&#10;Each island bears on its hidden side an outpost, a treasure or a trade agreement. After being discovered, these items are brought back to the home country (and the ship is removed from play, requiring the player to build a new one in order to keep searching). Outposts increase the productivity of workshops. Treasure yields either gold or free colonist promotions. Trade agreements reduce the gold needed to buy commodities from the bank.&#10;&#10;Besides being useful in these ways, outposts, gold and agreements are among the game's victory conditions. A player wins by being to first to attain three out of five objectives, namely, four outposts, 30 gold, three trade agreements, three colonists promoted to the top rank of &quot;merchant&quot; and the construction of four public buildings. The buildings (8 types, each bringing some advantage) cost nothing but don't become available until a player has recruited at least four colonists. After that, each new colonist adds a building (unless they've been preempted by other players; there aren't enough for everyone).&#10;&#10;Overall, the game falls squarely into the &quot;simultaneous solitaire&quot; category. Except in the race for islands, the players scarcely interact at all. They do, however, have a great many choices to make in the course of play.&#10;&#10;"

8207,,"Dungeoneer: Vault of the Fiends is a non-collectable dungeon-crawl card game for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;It is meant as an expansion to the Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord also published by Atlas Games, but Tomb of the Lich Lord is not necessary to play this set, as Vault of the Fiends is also a stand-alone set.&#10;&#10;Players play the part of one of six heroes.  Each hero has variable melee, magic and speed scores, as well as a unique ability. Your second role in the game is as the malevolent &ldquo;Dungeonlord&rdquo;, trying to exterminate the other heroes.&#10;&#10;You win the game when as a hero you complete 3 Quests such as destroying an evil laboratory or rescuing a princess. An alternate win goal is as the Dungeonlord if all the other heroes are defeated except yours.&#10;&#10;Vault of the Fiends features a variety of new heroes.  Elf Assassin, Human Beastmaster, Drakan Sentinal, Ork Shaman, Dwarf Runecaster, and Gnome Illusionist.&#10;&#10;Each turn you may:&#10;&#10;     Play monsters, traps and other bad events on opponents&#10;     Build a dungeon&#10;     Move around the dungeon with your hero (collect Glory and Peril resources)&#10;     Play abilities and treasures for yourself&#10;     Complete a Quest&#10;     Discard an unwanted card&#10;     Fill your hand to 5 cards&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is similar to Wiz-War where you race in a dungeon to complete your objectives.  This dungeon is created by the laying down of Map cards. You collect Glory and Peril as you move through the dungeon.  Glory buys cards that help your hero such as abilities and treasures, but your opponent spends your Peril against you to play monsters, traps and other unpleasant stuff.&#10;&#10;Combat is similar to Talisman. Roll a six-sided die and add the score you are combating with, either Melee or Magic, to beat your opponent&rsquo;s roll.&#10;&#10;The way the cards interact will be familiar to CCG players, in that you have &ldquo;Permanents&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instants&rdquo; that you can use strategically, or in combinations, but this game is not really a strategy game.  Most of the fun comes from the theme, and surprising combination of events that occur.  Dungeoneer is likely to appeal to those who enjoy a classic dungeon crawl and RPG like action.&#10;&#10;Vault of the Fiends features a few new mechanics that should serve to enhance the game play which players of Tomb of the Lich Lord will be familiar with.  Some monsters, and attack cards are &ldquo;pumpable&rdquo; that means you may spend extra Glory or Peril to boost the effectiveness of the card.  Also conditions on the map change such as effects being deactivated when a certain Quest is completed or throwing a switch in a room to extend a bridge across the Fiery Chasm.  One of the more unexpected new mechanics are &ldquo;artifact&rdquo; Quests, such as the Armor Golem&rsquo;s Glove which makes your hero more powerful or the Sunken Treasure which makes your hero faster.  These do not confer a level, but are rotated 180 degrees so you can read the bonus they provide.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dungeoneer Series.&#10;&#10;"

8209,,"Serata in Giallo (Evening of Mystery) is the premier collection of murder mystery games to appear in Italy.  The players are invited to an Evening of Mystery, during the course of which each player enacts the role of one of the protagonists of the event.  The games unfold in &ldquo;acts&rdquo; with a theatrical flavor, and the game may or may not include an &quot;investigation team.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sangue Blu&#10;&#10;Sir Reginald MacFergh has been murdered with a blow from a fireplace poker. In one corner of the dining room is his wife, in tears and suffering from shock. What happened here?&#10;A characteristically Sherlockian episode, &ldquo;Blue Blood&rdquo; takes place against the backdrop of a society divided in two: On one side, the nobility&mdash;proud of their peerage and contemptuous with their inferiors; on the other side, the humble servants searching for a way to defend their dignity.&#10;The rigid British society of the late 1800's sets the tone for rendering the performance of these entertaining and original characters.&#10;&#10;Place&mdash;Scotland&#10;&#10;Time&mdash;October 1895&#10;&#10;Characters&mdash;Six (3 men and 3 women):&#10;&#10;Sir Alex Carrington:  45-year-old bachelor of the most noble origins.  He is extremely proud, well-mannered, and refined. He has a condescending attitude towards those whom he considers inferior.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bruce Bonanno: 32 years old, of Italian origin. He has an exuberant, extroverted, and fiery nature.  He uses heavy irony to mock all nobility who visit Sir Reginald&rsquo;s estate.&#10;&#10;Mr. Cary Lynn: A handsome young 30-year-old man, with a substantial tan.  He is employed as a gardener for Sir Reginald&rsquo;s estate. He has a reserved but passionate nature.&#10;&#10;Lady Della MacFergh:  Sir Reginald&rsquo;s sister.  She is 35 years old and is extremely arrogant.&#10;&#10;Miss Evelyn: The MacFergh&rsquo;s 22-year-old maid.  She is very energetic and decisive.  She is not afraid to speak her mind&hellip;&#10;&#10;Lady Fiona Fraser: A very fascinating 28-year-old woman.  Originally from Adelaide (Australia), she is the daughter of Simon Fraser, a rich politician. Having grown up in a free and nonconformist environment, she is irritated with British traditionalism and with those who believe in absurd social rules.&#10;&#10;"
