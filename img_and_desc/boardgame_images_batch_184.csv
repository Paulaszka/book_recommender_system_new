The #1 cards are Mickey Mouse, the #2 cards are Minnie Mouse, the #3 cards are Pluto, the #4 cards are Thumper, the #5 cards are Goofy, the #6 cards are Dumbo, the #7 cards are Clarabelle, the #8 cards are Flower, the #9 cards are Daisy Duck, and the #10 cards are Chip 'n' Dale.  The last card is an instruction card.&#10;&#10;Game 1:  The four #1 cards are placed face-up on the table.  The remaining cards are shuffled and dealt to each player.  The player to the left of the dealer begins by playing a #2 card on a #1 card of the same color; this player can discard a second card by playing a #3 card of the same suit or any other #2 card.  A player can only discard up to two cards per turn. A Donald Duck card is to be played as an #11 card to complete a pile.  The first player to discard all his or her cards gains 10 points.  A player must gain 50 points to win the game.&#10;&#10;Game 2:  The second game is similar to a version of Crazy Eights or Uno.  Each player is dealt five cards.  The remaining cards are placed in a face down stack with one card turn upright.  Players discard cards by matching either the suit or number or by playing a wild Donald Duck card.  When a wild Donald Duck card is discarded, it is played sideways so that the next player will have to match the card underneath by suit or number or with another wild Donald Duck card.  The winner is the first player to discard all of his cards.&#10;&#10;"

Each card represents the side view of an aircraft completing a maneuver - climbing, diving, looping or some other similar action.&#10;&#10;The start card shows an aircraft taking off and to this players add further cards in a sequence with the smoke trails on the cards indicating where two cards can be connected together.  The card also indicates the difficulty of the stunt - and the points gained if the maneuver is successfully completed.&#10;&#10;Then idea of the game is to attempt to add cards allowing the aircraft to gain and lose altitude undertaking a variety of tricks on the way.  Whether the trick is achieved or not is determined by a die roll (throwing higher than a given number shown on some of the cards). Points are earned for a successfully completed maneuver. If you fail any part of the sequence then you score nothing.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the aircraft is brought in to land, through the laying of the appropriate card, at a level at the same altitude from which it took off.  The winner is the player who scored the most points during the flight.&#10;&#10;The game has three variants OVER THE CLOUDS (3-5 players)  DARE-DEVILS (2-4 players) and SKY-RIDER (3-6 players)which, though broadly similar, do make the game suitable for differing numbers of players.&#10;&#10;"

Who will manage to bring back the most treasures?&#10;&#10;The basic principle of this small risk taking game is extremely simple. During each round of play, all players simultaneously choose an adventurer, from the four of their respective team, which they wish to send into the cave to recover treasures.&#10;&#10;This choice will be done according to a &quot;crystal ball&quot; prediction, which is never highly reliable.&#10;&#10;So players must bear in mind the power and the range of the flame of the dragon, and the &quot;fire resistance&quot; of each adventurer (from very weak for Spark, to very high for Ice Breaker). Also because the cave is narrow the placement of the adventurers in the cave is very limited.&#10;&#10;An ascending order of fire resistances will be carried out. In fact, the more resistant an adventurer is, the slower he runs. In other words, the more you take a risk, the higher your choice of placement will be, but the more likely it is your adventurer will get scorched.&#10;&#10;Lastly, to protect your valorous adventurers from the small sudden changes of mood of the dragon (anger, fury...) as well as the various tricks of your adversaries, who will surely never miss an opportunity to prevent you from recovering treasures, you will have at your disposal a complete set of magic items tailor-made for this kind of &quot;sport&quot; so it's up to you to use them wisely.&#10;&#10;The winner will obviously be the player who has piled up the most treasures at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"

Marbles must be placed on a large, plastic centrally-located daisy, which has vague depressions on each 'petal' for the marbles to rest in.

Four are dealt to each player; a turn consists of playing a card &amp; following the directions.  If either the placing or removal of marbles causes the daisy to tip over, the player causing the incident must take all the marbles that fall from the daisy.&#10;&#10;When all four cards are used (i.e. when each player has had four turns) the pack is reshuffled and a fresh set of four cards is dealt to each player.  Play continues in this manner until a player is able to place their final marble on one of the daisy's petals without causing any to fall.&#10;&#10;The player who achieves this is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;"
