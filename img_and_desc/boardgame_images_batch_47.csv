5419,,"From spielbox-online.de, translated via altavista babel fish (with a lot of manual tweaks):&#10;&#10;Magna Grecia (The cradle of the civilization) is the main attraction of the year with Clementoni. The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.&#10;&#10;The southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.&#10;&#10;Sufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents' cities.&#10;&#10;The board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).&#10;&#10;Markets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.&#10;&#10;"

Once purchased, a plot may be put into production by buying a rig for it or moving a rig (which costs money) from another plot --there is a limited number of rigs overall.&#10;&#10;Production is affected by weather (weather cards in a winter/spring/summer/fall cycle); the northern plots are more likely to be shut down by bad weather.

5440,,"Based on Chess, but with less tactical requirements of the player.&#10;&#10;Players have eight pieces - six soldiers, a King and a Kings Guard. The player starts by rolling a dice, giving him a number that is the maximum moves that player can make during his turn. He may move any pieces he wants as long as their moves add up to or below the total rolled on the dice. All pieces move once for every dot on the dice except the King's Guard, who moves twice, never less, for each spot used.&#10;&#10;This is played out on a chess board with a blue and a red team. Blue moves first. The objectives are either to kill the other King whilst protecting one's own (Eliminator) or just to kill every enemy piece on the board (Speed Eliminator). To perform a kill, your piece must leap frog another. If your piece passes over another - whichever team it belongs to - it is dead and removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Each piece has a forward facing arrow on its head except the King's Guard. These show the directions the pieces are allowed to move in. The KG may move in any direction, but for the other pieces to change direction, the directional dice (which tells you which way to turn) must be rolled instead of the movement dice. The result of the roll must be adhered to with one of your pieces changing direction accordingly.&#10;&#10;If a piece reaches the enemy's side, it recieves a cap that allows it to move in any direction. This cap is also a shield which can 'die' instead of the piece, should the piece be killed. If the piece lands infront of the King, the cap may be transfered, but the piece must remain in the direction it faces when the cap is removed.&#10;&#10;A four player version has been developed and can be accessed from the link below, but email me at writer@philipstobbart.co.uk for the username and password before going for it!&#10;&#10;"

5445,,"Rod Hockey is a relatively inexpensive representation of the dome-style hockey games found in many arcade halls.&#10;&#10;Using steel rods, plastic or metal hockey players slide along defined track segments.  There are five players and one goalie per side, just like real hockey.  Players simultaneously turn and move their five metal rods to shoot the puck and pass.  Games can be played using a timer or to a set number of points.&#10;&#10;Many different versions of this game have been published over the last 50+ years.&#10;&#10;Steel rods with metal gears were used before plastic ones, the plastic gear system was quickly abandoned as gears would not last. From there a curved spring was used (ImageID: 427829) from rod to player holding slider. This worked well for durability. This changed the game though considerably, as there was a bit of spring action in shooting. Slap shots were less powerful, but wrist shots worked better. Many different ice layouts were made for rod and player movement within the defined track segments. Swiveled tracks made players look like they were skating down the ice. This changed play and tactics for each game, it was considered having home ice advantage, as you were used to your game surface design. You knew how the puck bounced off the boards and where to exploit the best scoring chances. Various pucks were used, heavier ones worked better with the gear system, lighter ones worked better with the spring system. The puck with the steel ball in center moved the fastest and was most popular for the avid player.&#10;&#10;"

5453,,"From Avalanche Press:&#10;&#10;For over 700 years, Spanish Christians tried to exterminate the Arab kingdoms of southern Spain. This great &quot;Reconquista&quot; fired the crusading zeal of countless generations. The Arabs, or Moors as the Spanish knew them, saw the Spaniards as backward barbarians and fought ferociously to protect their sophisticated civilization. Finally, in 1482 King Ferdinand of Aragon embarked on the last campaign, to take the fabled city of Granada from its Islamic rulers.&#10;&#10;This quick-playing, physically beautiful game re-creates the final 10-year struggle for Granada. Players take command of the Christian and Moslem holy warriors. God is on your side. Will you prevail? &#10;&#10;Granada is a two-player game based on the 1481-1492 campaign between Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castille on one side (the &quot;Spanish player&quot;) and Muhammed XII and later Muhammed XIII on the other (the &quot;Moorish player&quot;). The game's designer is Robert G. Markham, known for Soldier Kings: The Seven Years War Worldwide and dozens of other game designs.&#10;&#10;The game is not overly complex. The game board (mounted, 22x17 inches) shows southern Spain including the Kingdom of Granada and surrounding areas. A network of key points is laid over this map, with castles, ports and unfortified areas connected by roads. Troops move along these roads from point to point. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to conquer the Moorish kingdom - Granada herself and five other important Moorish sites. The Moorish player seeks to prevent this, or to force peace on the Spaniards by taking their key cities of Cordoba and Lorca.&#10;&#10;Each player has troops with which to carry out these tasks - knights, cavalry, and foot soldiers plus warships. The Spanish player also has siege cannon. Both players have leaders to move their troops and assist them in battle, with Ferdinand for the Spaniards and Muhammed al-Zagal for the Moors being much better at this than other leaders.&#10;&#10;In battle, both players place their units on a combat display and roll dice to determine how many &quot;hits&quot; are achieved. Four hits will eliminate most units. The best units in the game are the Moorish Jund armored cavalry and the fanatic Spanish Knights of Santiago and Calatrava. A well-manned castle is very difficult to capture, but the Spanish siege guns can make an enormous difference. At sea, the Spanish player is trying to deny the Moor reinforcements from Africa. Many Moorish troops are volunteers from overseas, who must arrive at ports. The Moor can also gain aid from the Ottoman Empire, but only if he or she has kept the ports open.&#10;&#10;"

Each die that comes up 1 earns you a cap and the opportunity to roll again.  If you choose to do so, you roll the 0 dice in the hope of getting more 1s...But if you roll no 1s, you lose your turn and any 1s rolled previously.  Hence the Temptation.  If you manage to get five 1s, you place five caps (see below) and take another turn.&#10;&#10;The caps won must be placed in a straight orthogonal line, adjacent to at least one previously placed cap.  You lose the caps won if you can't place them.  You may even cap off part of another player's grid --this helps him somewhat, but may make the rest of his grid harder to cap off, by breaking up the pattern.&#10;&#10;When playing multiple rounds, the winner of a round scores the other players' remaining cap spaces.&#10;&#10;"

Whoever brings back the most to his planet, facing natural dangers and the enemy's might, wins.&#10;&#10;Ships come in four types: Astrobase (strongest, initially carries everything else), Fighter (fast but weak), Battle-Cruiser (medium strength, carries Laser Gun and Force Field Transmitter) and Carrier (slowest and weakest, transports the Uranium [NOT the Fighters] --may steal the cargo of another Carrier).  Each is rated in Offensive Potential, Defensive Potential and Motion Potential (which is also the Firing Range).  Laser Guns are immobile firing platforms; Force Field Transmitters are obstacles and may be combined to erect linear barriers (when their separation is at most 3 hexes).&#10;&#10;Natural obstacles include Magnetic Storm Zones, Asteroids (fixed and mobile) and a Black Hole.  Combat uses a classic odds-ratio table (CRT), with possible results being destruction, breakdown (out of action for a turn) or deviation (moving the ship 3 hexes) --the aggressor may suffer as well as the defender, depending on the odds.

5492,,"First there was UNO. Well, first there was Crazy Eights, but never mind.&#10;&#10;Then came Zar which added even more viciousness. The &quot;draw two&quot; card in Zar is a colored Wasp. The trick is, if you play a Wasp in response to being zapped by a wasp, then the opponent to your left must draw 2 cards equal to the numbers of wasp cards in the stack, unless your opponent plays a wasp which would make the next player draw even more cards unless HE also played a wasp, etc.&#10;&#10;It's not uncommon for players to quickly draw huge handfuls of cards. There is a nice  balancing mechanism however. If you can match an identical card that someone just played you can &quot;match&quot; the player by quickly discarding the card. The player who played the original card must draw one card and play passes to the next player from the person who laid the Match. So the more cards you have in your hand, the more matches you can make to get rid of them.&#10;&#10;Zar has a faster pace than UNO and constantly keeps you on toes to match your opponent's cards.

You can&rsquo;t win unless you have 10 Object cards on your side with no virus tokens on them. Other Action cards shield your Objects from viruses (like Anti Virus), and help to clean virus tokens off your Object cards (Cleanup). There are Action cards that allow you to steal a card from another player (Piracy), remove anti-virus protection (AV Killer), or that pesky Virus Generator card (Scan), or search for a card in the discard pile (Backup). Some Action cards like Virus!, Recycle or Repair use a 6-sided die to determine how many virus tokens are placed or removed from your Object cards. This adds an aspect of chance to the game, and helps make every game you play different.&#10;&#10;A more attainable goal of playing to just 6 virus-free objects is recommended by some players.&#10;&#10;"

The combat rules are more streamlined than that of Morheim, and the campaign game is more fleshed out.  You can buy add-ons to the home base of your mining company that can do numerous things for you.  Things that increase income, security, etc.&#10;&#10;Many battles take place in the corridors of the mines, but the battle can be taken to a player's home base if needed.  As such, players map out their home bases as they purchase rooms (e.g. jails, vaults, storage, etc), fortifications (e.g. gates, walls, traps, etc), and other assorted upgrades on to them.&#10;&#10;RAFM has released other races to play, including Orcs, Undead, and &quot;Reptiliads&quot; (lizard men) to name a few.

5527,,"Memo Street combines the classic games of Memory and Yahtzee.&#10;&#10;A game consists of ten rounds. In each round the players attempt to cover one of the ten rows on their scoreboard with tiles, trying to score the maximum number of points as they do so. The board is established by laying the tiles face down on the table in a rectangular grid.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they turn over any three tiles. The player then picks one of the 10 rows (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) on their scoreboard and places one, two, or three of the tiles on their scoreboard, provided they fit. Any tiles that can't be used are left on the table and turned over again where they are. No tiles may be added to or removed from a row on a scoreboard that contains only one or two tiles. If none of the tiles turned up can fit on a free row, the player must declare one of his free rows invalid by placing one of the tiles turned up face down on the first square of the row (the others are returned to the table face down).&#10;&#10;Game ends after the tenth round, and the winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;"
