Gates are opening all over the city, monsters are on the loose, and Cthulhu is starting to stir from his endless slumber. You need to close all the gates and kill all the monsters before Cthulhu wakes up and destroys everything.&#10;&#10;This game is an attempt to make an express version of Arkham Horror. The primary game mechanic is a &quot;Move/Effort&quot; system, in which 2 eight-sided dice are rolled, and one is used for movement and the other for actions. Higher numbers are better for both, but be careful. Every time you roll doubles, you are one step closer to defeat.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to completely remove the dark forces by closing all the gates and destroying all the monsters. Over the course of the game, various things (the biggest being rolling doubles at any time) cause the doom track to fill up. The players need to remove the dark forces before the track fills, or they all lose.&#10;&#10;"

Wield the Sword of the Phoenix and poison your foes with Black Lotus! Slay Thoth-Amon's minions, Pict raiders, and abominable monsters, and hear the lamentations of their women! On many of the cards, the publisher provides context by including relevant quotes from Howard's work.&#10;&#10;Munchkin Conan has a new type of card &ndash; birthright &ndash; and the mechanisms are similar to that of classes and races in that you can have only one in play at a time; you may discard a birthright at any time but may play one only on your turn or when you first get it. The Munchkin Conan core set comes with two birthrights: &quot;Noble&quot;, which allows you to have an extra Comrade (see below), and &quot;Barbarian&quot;, which allows you to ignore all &quot;Usable By&quot; and &quot;Not Usable By&quot; restrictions on items. There is no birthright analogue to &quot;Super Munchkin&quot; or &quot;Half-Breed&quot;.&#10;&#10;Speaking of races and classes, the races in Munchkin Conan are &quot;Kushite&quot;, &quot;Zamoran&quot;, &quot;Cimmerian&quot;, and &quot;Stygian&quot;; when playing a blender game, they are all considered to be human unless the other sets have non-human races. The classes are &quot;Cleric&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Wizard&quot;, and are identical to the fantasy Munchkin classes with the same names.&#10;&#10;The Munchkin Conan hireling is called a Comrade. Comrades fall in the same class as the Hirelings, Minions, Mooks, Sidekicks, etc. that come with other flavors of Munchkin. Each Comrade is associated with a class or birthright, and gives you some of the advantages of that class/birthright. Comrades can carry an item for you, even some that you can't legally use yourself, and their gender matters. They also have the standard Hireling ability to sacrifice themselves to give you an automatic escape when running away.&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;"

For example &quot;Stand up and take a bow&quot; Once a player has landed on three prize spaces they are the winner. The winner must then do what the three prize tokens say.&#10;&#10;

All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice.  Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile. The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;"

During each race two players will be the bookmakers, the ones who set the odds on the four horses. At the start of the race, four race cards from the deck of 80 cards are turned face-up, while each player (including each bookmaker) is dealt four race cards face down. Players look at these cards to determine which cards are out of play &ndash; that is, which horses are less likely to move during the race. The bookmakers secretly exchange two cards each to give them extra information.&#10;&#10;Then the bookmakers individually set odds on the four horses (1:1, 1:2, and so on, with the total of the second numbers adding to at least ten). They reveal these odds to the other players, who must then place at least one bet with one bookmaker. They can place more bets if desired, even with both bookmakers. Each bookmaker records the amount bet and the odds for that horse, and he can then lower the odds on that horse if desired (but if the total of the odds would drop below ten, he must raise the payoff on another horse. Players continue placing bets as long as they want.&#10;&#10;Once all bets are finished, players remove all cards from play, then reveal cards from the top of the deck one-by-one, moving the appropriately colored horse forward one space for each card revealed. Whichever horse reaches the #10 spot on the track first wins. All players who bet on this horse are paid off in the appropriate amount from the bookmakers. During the race, the betters can ask for credit from the bank to spend and win more money &ndash; but of course in the end, they will be forced to pay the money back to the bank with interest!&#10;&#10;After an agreed upon number of races, with each player being bookmaker the same number of times, whoever has the most money wins!&#10;&#10;Variant rules in Bookmaker add wild race cards that move the horse which moved on the previous turn, a bet on which horse is the nag, and a harness option in which horses can break from the track and be disqualified.&#10;&#10;"
