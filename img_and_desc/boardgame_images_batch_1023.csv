The goal is to reach the opponent's baseline with 3 stones, or to hit so many of the opponent's stones that he becomes unable to move. The number stones may be moved one square at a time. The special feature of the game is to arrange your number stones on the board in such a way that valid arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are created. Example: with the number tiles 2, 14, 16 in a row, the arithmetic operation 2+14=16 can be represented. The first number piece of the calculation may skip the result of the calculation. If the reached field is occupied by a foreign number piece, this is beaten.&#10;&#10;"

Be careful you don't end up in the shadow, and use the power of light to form complete RAINBOWS. Tactics, combination skills and a good memory are what it takes to win.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is...&#10;...to collect more cards than your opponent by playing your cards skilfully.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can play up to 3 cards in the common area, but you have to play at least 1 card. But:&#10;&#10;- If you want to play more than 1 card, you must turn over any one of the cards already on the table. This means, cards are always turned over and played alternately. You cannot turn over or play two cards in a row.&#10;&#10;- You can choose to play your cards &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;blind&quot;. &#10;Standard means you place the card with the side you can see facing up. &#10;Blind means you place the card with the back (that you haven't seen) facing up.&#10;&#10;- Error! If you play or turn over a card in a colour that is already on display, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.&#10;&#10;- Shadow! If you play or turn over a card in black, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.&#10;&#10;- Rainbow! If you succeed in playing the 6th card of the row in a colour still missing from the rainbow, you have successfully formed a RAINBOW. As a reward, you receive all 6 cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when there are not enough cards in the deck for a player to bring their hand back up to 3 cards. The player who has collected the most cards in their personal pile wins.&#10;&#10;"

My intention over the past few years has been to distill the entire experience provided by the great thematic-narrative games into a compact and portable product, yet with great depth in mechanics, story, tactics, and atmosphere.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the Ashes&quot; can be seen as a solo dungeon crawler with an epic campaign, legendary battles, and a dramatic story that will provide you with memorable plays anywhere, all within the confines of this book.&#10;&#10;The experience of the great thematic-narrative games, in book format.&#10;&#10;This means that by drawing and marking on the paper:&#10;&#10;You'll move your character across the board to fight against sinister enemies.&#10;You'll play action cards to create spectacular combos.&#10;You'll level up your character to specialize in forbidden disciplines.&#10;You'll find legendary items to enhance your abilities.&#10;You'll make difficult decisions that will affect the story.&#10;You'll tempt fate by applying sources of controlled chance to actions and behaviors.&#10;You'll battle powerful bosses with unique mechanics and cunning intelligence.&#10;You'll discover hidden references in the images that will grant you access to secret advantages.&#10;You'll be able to study a grimoire of runes to boost your attacks.&#10;And all this you'll do in the book, using nothing more than a pencil (or a pen).&#10;&#10;An epic campaign of more than 12 hours and fully replayable.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the Ashes&quot; has been designed from the ground up to be played solo. You'll play through crucial moments in the lives of various characters, switching between them as the story requires. However, nothing is stopping you from playing in a group, reading, fighting, drawing, and making decisions together.&#10;&#10;If you're looking for an experience inspired by games like &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Imperial Assault&quot;, &quot;Gloomhaven&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Death Monster&quot;, &quot;Tainted Grail&quot;, &quot;Mansions of Madness&quot;, &quot;Arkham Horror LCG&quot;, &quot;Journeys in Middle-Earth&quot;, or &quot;Sleeping Gods&quot;, but differently and originally, portable and compact, this is your game.&#10;&#10;It takes a second to start playing &quot;In the Ashes&quot;, and another second to pack it away. Whether you have only five minutes or an entire afternoon, you can play it on the train, at the beach, at a bus stop, on the sofa, or even lying in bed. There's no need to erase anything, even when you want to replay the campaign after finishing it.&#10;&#10;&quot;In the Ashes&quot; follows an &quot;open and play&quot; philosophy: you'll learn to play as you progress through the first pages, in a tutorial of increasing complexity fully integrated with the story. However, detailed rules are available in the final pages for consultation whenever you want.&#10;&#10;Focus on living the adventure, without maintenance or complications.&#10;&#10;You don't need a table, an app, to print out a character sheet, or even an eraser (there's no need to erase anything). Forget about constantly flipping from page to page to read sections or check statistics, as the book has been designed to minimize upkeep so that you can spend your playtime fully immersed in the different scenes, applying your strategy to each challenge.&#10;&#10;You also don't need dice (though you can use them if you like), as the sources of controlled randomness are in the book itself. As you progress through the story and unlock new characters, you'll need not just luck, but also your memory, insight, and precision to maximize your attacks.&#10;&#10;Is an epic solitaire adventure with tactical tabletop combat that offers you a 12-hour narrative campaign that's fully replayable. You can set up and save your current situation instantly, and you can play as long as you want &mdash; from five minutes to all day. It contains an epic story with character evolution, dozens of enemies, legendary items, and spectacular combos with cards.&#10;&#10;"

In this narrative puzzle adventure, an intimate coming-of-age story is told through an object that serves as a tarot deck, a puzzle game, and a work of art.

Puzzles are solved using sets of  Minor Arcana cards and clues from the story booklet and result in solution keywords that lead players to discover new pieces of the narrative. Some story passages grant items which can be later used to unlock extra scenes, and some puzzles have multiple answers, allowing players to unlock more of the story if they find all the solutions.&#10;&#10;Packed with gorgeous illustrations, resonant storytelling, and unique puzzles, The Light in the Mist can be played solo or cooperatively in a small group. Its non-linear structure and varied puzzle difficulty will engage players of all experience levels with over five hours of gameplay.
