Chief among these are Fate&rsquo;s Villains, who are hunting for the Deck of Wonders at her command (or perhaps for their own selfish reasons).&#10;&#10;When the game starts, you select the Villain you want to face off against. Each Villain has a set of special rules you MUST follow and a set of cards that you MUST use in your deck as long as you're facing them.

This works because each card has two halves: one to use if drawn on the Player turn, and one to use if drawn on the Villain turn. The Villain halves are stronger, faster, and more powerful than yours (Fate is on their side after all), but they will attack mindlessly following a simple set of rules called the Priority System. It's up to you to outplay the stronger Villain by manipulating the Priority System and leveraging the synergies of the deck you've built!&#10;&#10;As you defeat Villains and progress in the game, you will unlock special legacy packs. Each legacy pack will have special cards that alter the play experience in surprising ways, forcing you to change your strategic approach. Once a Villain is fully defeated, you can add their cards to your Collection for use against other, more powerful Villains. You may even unlock special, permanent upgrades for your cards!

Playable by 1 to 2 players in 1 hour, the game comes with a card-driven solitaire engine.  Designed by Maurice Suckling (designer of Freeman's Farm 1777), the game uses many of the concepts from that game.  However, added hidden movement, much more maneuver, and other design tweaks make this a truly unique game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players will play 1 of their 3 in-hand formation cards to maneuver or attack enemy forces, gaining momentum cubes based on the formation activated.  Each formation is a Confederate division or Union corps.  Each formation card will allow a major and possibly an additional minor activation, major allowing two moves for a formation while the minor allows one move.  After each formation moves combat can occur if a move ends in a location with an enemy formation.  Tactic cards may be played during the formation's activation giving it movement or combat bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the end of the formation card activation players may spend their momentum cubes to buy tactics cards which may give them benefits in combat or movement in future turns.&#10;&#10;Players then draw a new formation card refilling their hands to 3.  Hooker, Lee, and Jackson have bonuses that can be played once a game, adding to movement and combat.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by destroying enemy formations through morale/strength loss, or the Union occupying the three victory locations which represent cutting off the Confederate army from Richmond.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow for fixed defensive positions, Jackson's Flank March -- and even his death.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Mack, being a bit in the dark about the French maneuvers, sent a force under Baron Auffenberg, to determine where the French were.  The Baron's force marched into a very bad situation where his troops, mostly grenadiers, was seriously outnumbered.

He saw a small group of Austrians in the town of Hohenreichen and ordered the Dragoons he was with the dismount and clear out the Austrians.

It's designed for two players and can be played with a standard 54-card deck of playing cards (including the two jokers). A major difference between the two games is that Rumnastic! allows &quot;runs&quot; in the same suit; for example, 8, 9, 10 of spades. This makes the game feel as familiar as any rummy game, and adds an interesting strategic element.&#10;&#10;A game is played to 200 points and typically lasts two to four rounds.&#10;&#10;The Rumnastic! deck posted here has information on the cards which makes playing the game much easier than with a standard deck.
