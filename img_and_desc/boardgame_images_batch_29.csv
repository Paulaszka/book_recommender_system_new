The &lsquo;Old Man of the Continental Detective Agency&rsquo; gives out assignments. Everything players need to dig out the clues, search out the suspects and figure out the solutions is here: detailed 1930s maps of San Francisco and the Bay Area, directories alphabetically listing thousands of people and places encountered in investigations, a case book with hundreds of clues to unravel, police mug shots with vital statistics on dozens of known criminals, dated newspapers, a fingerprint file, time sheets for recording the time spent on each clue, and case reports with the solutions to the cases.&#10;&#10;Gumshoe is not a role-playing game or a board game. It is a detective investigation game for the individual or team who work to solve a large number of cases.  Game is from the makers of the innovative and award-winning Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective.  Gumshoe introduces several new gaming concepts, it continues the traditions of simple rules, elaborate and well-constructed plots, excellent writing and faithfulness to its period style, which made the Consulting Detective series so popular worldwide.&#10;&#10;"

(The kids love fussing with it.)&#10;&#10;The game board has an outside track, the Invention Track, and an inside track, the Royalty Track. On the Invention Track is where you pick up the various inventions (like buying properties in Monopoly). Instead of building house and hotels, you get a Patent Claim Clip attached to the invention card. This patent clip has a 0, 1, or 2 on it. The number assigned is random. The higher patent clip number, the more your patent makes you come royalty collection time. Eureka Cards can also be played that allow you to do special actions during your turn. The game limit is set by the usage of the Patent Claim clips. When the last one is used, the game ends.  The player with the highest combined total of cash on hand invention value wins.&#10;&#10;"

3408,,"This Accursed Civil War is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the First English Civil War: 1642-1646. It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.&#10;&#10;The battles included in this game are:&#10;&#10;Edgehill, 23 October 1642&#10;    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.&#10;&#10;First Newbury, 20 September 1643&#10;    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.&#10;&#10;Marston Moor, 2 July 1644&#10;    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.&#10;&#10;Second Newbury, 27 October 1644&#10;    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.&#10;&#10;Naseby, 14 June 1645&#10;    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.&#10;&#10;2nd Printing Note: This reprint version will include an updated series rulebook and playbook and an Edgehill variant scenario, as well as numerous updates to the counters.

3412,,"An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.&#10;&#10;General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.&#10;&#10;Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Number disks from 1-50 are shuffled, and one is drawn.  Players race to find three tiles whose equation (first times second, plus or minus third, or any other combination of two tiles multiplied and the other added or subtracted) adds to that total.  The first to do so wins the disk.  Whomever has the most disks when they are all claimed wins the game.&#10;&#10;Nominally the game is for 1-6 players, although the upper bound is arbitrary and the rules say nothing about how the game might be played solo. Possible solo challenges involve seeing how many tokens you can claim in a set time (e.g. 10 minutes total) or how many tokens you can claim racing against a countdown timer (e.g. 5-10 seconds per token).&#10;&#10;"

If you reach the ball you shoot the ball by the unused number of pips on the die plus one, and can make passes between players of your team. &#10;The die makes luck a part of this game. But your choices, like which player you move to which field and where to pass the ball are very important. For the following turns you calculate chances for your opponent and yourself and you try to have your players in good positions for later situations.&#10;&#10;"

A &quot;goal&quot; expression is formed, and then players take turns moving one cube at a time to one of three areas: Forbidden, Permitted, or Required. Each move is supposed to keep possible the ability to eventually form an expression equal to the goal, but it must not be possible to form such an expression immediately if there are still cubes remaining in the resources pile. Players may challenge each other if they believe a move has rendered impossible any expression that equals the goal, or if an expression can be formed prematurely. When a challenge is issued, all other players decide which side they want to be on. The side claiming that an expression is possible, has the burden of proof to create such an expression. The final expression must use all the Required cubes, none of the Forbidden cubes, and as many Permitted cubes as desired. Expressions are written down; the cubes are not moved. Parentheses may be inserted as desired. Rounds continue until some agreed condition is met (high score reached, or number of rounds).&#10;&#10;"

You're supposed to answer as if you were the personality and the questioner is supposed to guess who you are. If they guess correctly, they advance along a track, if they fail, the next player tries another question and so on. If no-one guesses correctly, you reverse down the track for giving bad clues. The hilarious party element is that the Personality cards include the Sins, so you would answer as if you were that player.&#10;&#10;"

This special deck, however, has 60 cards, instead of the standard 52, which changes (for the better) the odds of the game and increases the strategy involved.  Another difference from the classic game, is that the publishers have added a game board for keeping score, adding even more strategy, because players have choices on how to move their pawns.&#10;&#10;The game starts with a round of the Golden Deuce card game - lay down higher tricks than the other players for control of the lead. Be the first player to lay down all the cards in your hand, and you gain points for all the cards left in the other players' hands.&#10;&#10;Moving to the game board, each player strategically moves any of their pawns the number of spaces to match the points earned in the card game round. Players can choose to move all of their pawns around the board at once (and therefore be able to block out opponents) or move one at a time (and capitalize on the amount of spaces moved).&#10;&#10;Once all players have moved, another card game round starts, and the game ends when one player has moved all of their pawns to the finish.&#10;&#10;"
