Rules: Cards are placed down one at a time. Two players see who can make the correct animal sound first. The person who makes the correct sound first, holds on to the card. When the rabbit card appears - don't make a sound! If you do - you lose one of your cards. It helps to have a judge, too, to determine who shouts out the right sound first. Whoever ends up with the most cards in the end wins.&#10;&#10;"
