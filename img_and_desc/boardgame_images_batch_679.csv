A team game,&#10;&#10;It's no issue to simulate ambient noise, the poor quality of telephone communication, .. On the one hand we'll put two teams in the competition (which will happen to find his treasure in first... and then it will create an emulation.. a sense of urgency, like a crisis situation). And in addition, we will impose, round after round, a way to communication even further (sorry.. pas could help..), such as talking with your hand in front of your mouth, or like a ventriloquist...&#10;&#10;To take into account the possibility of being wrong because different terrain typess, near the treasure the different areas of the treasure map will bear the name of beaches... all different beaches, but with similar pronouniations. (Oracabech Playa, Ocarabess Palia, Oracabess Playa etc etc...).&#10;&#10;Finally, to follow the paths on the reconstituted map with your finger... These paths are almost impossible to follow with the naked eye... Indeed, they have green dotted amid the lush greenery in orange red tones... On the other hand, when we place the small red filter of transparent plastic on the map and push it with our finger, flora disappears, leaving the path that must be followed...&#10;&#10;The most interesting part of this game, it is that, in explanation, we are told only the rules of the game to the different teams. Each is free to use the mode of communication and  following the roads seems it best adapted to the situation... And with the urgency of the game, against the competition, each trying to go to the more quickly... and forget everything else. Except that at the end of each part, without using clear communication techniques, no chance to have found the right solution... repeat the exercise with communication secure leads, each time to find the solution.&#10;&#10;In summary, this game is more meaningful than all the usual seminars playful setting, and which led to doubt one's understanding...&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;Game is only played with 4 players, 2 on each time. One of each pair of players is the apprentice attempting to find the treasure with the map by  blindly pushing a smaller red player piece. As you get closer and closer to the treasure (likely different colours or borders to indicate different zones), the other player (playing your pirate mentor) has their directions conveyed more and more muffled to simulate their memory or your understanding of their directions becoming less and less certain. Either it's a time trial between the two teams, going one at a time or it's simultaneously play (and the first to reach the treasure wins.&#10;&#10;"

Becoming a Pirate has few rewards and will immediately alienate you from ports unless it too flies the Jolly Rodger.&#10;&#10;The game evolves quickly and as the players get closer to their winning objectives, a race emerges to either beat them to the pip or to sabotage their efforts and gain some more time to build on their own convoy.

Fire Ants! is a card game where you play as an ant and fires are breaking out throughout the ant colony. As a fire ant, you must extinguish those fires by collecting resources from the card deck. The fires can only be extinguished by collecting a certain number of metal cards, a certain number of plastic cards, and a certain number of water cards. You will also find ant magic cards which can be used in place of any resource card that you need. Each fire card that you extinguish is worth a certain value. The higher the point value on the fire cards, the more resources that are needed to extinguish that fire. At the end of the game, if all fires were extinguished then whoever scored the most points from their fire cards win. However, the game can beat you when seven fire cards are played at the same time and no one can put out the fires. When this happens, your entire colony has burnt to the ground.&#10;&#10;Box Contents: The game comes in a small box that easily holds the 90 playing cards within it.&#10;&#10;Game Play: At the start of the game, each player is dealt three cards and a five point double sided fire card is placed in the middle of the table. This fire will not be extinguished for a few rounds with players drawing a single card. You will need a total of 11 resources (2 metal, 4 plastic, and 5 waters) to capture this card and to put out this fire. While players are drawing cards to get that five point boost to their score, other fire cards may be drawn. When this occurs they are placed down onto the table. There are two five point fire cards, two four point fire cards, three three point fire cards, four two point fire cards, and five one point fire cards. If at any point, seven fire cards are placed onto the table, one of the players must put out a single fire without drawing any additional cards. If no one can, the game is over and the colony has burnt down and everyone loses. If you are able to get through the entire deck, then you know someone will win. You will need to reshuffle the cards and then it is a race to get the remaining cards to determine the overall winner.&#10;&#10;--Chad Osborn (TheDiceHaveIt)&#10;&#10;"

Players compete, however, to obtain larger shares of the rewards for successfully destroying monster parts and, ultimately, more victory points then their fellow adventurers. Most games end with the Mamono's defeat, at which time the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;A player's party has a single hit point count, which is both the party's life and its available action points. Individual characters do not die, whole parties do, and incur a victory point penalty. Damage dealt to the party is based on hate markers, which accrue to players in proportion to their success against the monster. Dealing more damage to the Mamono will mean greater incoming damage to manage. Key to victory is handling increasing damage while defeating the monster to earn VPs.&#10;&#10;"

Napoleon's French Army of the North faces Wellington's hodge-podge Army of the Low Countries, who are fighting for time while awaiting the arrival of Blucher's Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine. The maps use natural contours to show elevations, withterrain features including the critical chateaux, villages and farms, walls, woods, hedges, sunken roads, slopes, streams, and marshes.&#10;&#10;Most of the vividly colored counters represent combat units: infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons, artillery batteries, and engineer detachments. Many battalions have additional counters for specialist skirmishers, or additional counters to represent greater size. Unit capabilities are modified by a number of formation markers, from infantry squares to cavalry vedettes. Individual leaders enhance unit performance, while each army's high command is represented by key commanders and unit headquarters.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics have been streamlined; a single dice roll inflicts casualties and disorder. Units and larger organizations wear down over time and must be rested or risk a catastrophic collapse. Finesse trumps brute strength in combat; players must utilize a variety of arms, formations, and tactics to seize key ground and destroy enemy units. Hidden movement allows each player to prepare surprises for the other. Multiple scenarios cover everything from the historical battle to a fight for an individual chateau. The French player may decide on an early start, or even on turning the battle into a demonstration.&#10;&#10;The Prussian arrival can occur early with fewer troops, or later with more, at the will of the allied player.

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.&#10;&#10;If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...&#10;&#10;"

At the beginning of the game, the players move around in the laboratory to find out, who plays &quot;Ingeneur Holt&quot;. The roles are previously determined by card drawing. If a pawn gets on a space, that is occupied by another pawn, this pawn has to reveal it's identity. When &quot;Holt&quot; is exposed, he sabotages the gold-making machine and the sliding doors begin to close. Now all players have to leave the laboratory before the doors are closed. The pawns that don't make it, die in the explosion and their players are expelled from the game. The rest have to move over the turntable and reach one of three escape tunnels. The first one to accomplish this wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
