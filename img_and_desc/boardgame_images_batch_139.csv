15849,,"A Finnish boardgame that is in many ways similar to Afrikan t&#195;&#164;hti, but is set in the 1849 goldrush in Alaska, and expands on the basic idea of that game. The game board has spaces for 25 face-down chits but there are actually two sets of chits placed on top of each other, green and black; and black chits may only be searched (turned face-up) after ALL the green chits have been discovered. Instead of looking for one special chit that allows a player to win the game, the aim is to dig gold worth of $2000 and then head for the nearest starting point, which are located corners of the gameboard. At this point, other players however still have a chance to compete for victory, for if one of them manages to find the 'Letter from Home' chit among the black chits, that triggers an end-of-game race in which the first player to reach any corner is the winner. As an added bonus, the finder of the letter gets to double their movement afterwards, while other players (excluding the one who triggered the end of the game) have the added handicap that they have to visit Klondyke first.&#10;&#10;The starting points are named after six well known gold diggers from this period: Big Hawk Haida, Annie &quot;Get Your Gun&quot; Oakley, James W. Marshall, Kit Carson, C. G. Larsson and Jim Bridger. There is a very short biography of each in the rules, and a short history of the Alaska goldrush.&#10;&#10;The game is dedicated to the designer's daughter Inka.&#10;&#10;"

Each player receives one Samurai and, beginning with Black, drops them onto their respective cells in turn.

15880,,"The Hollywood Card Game is a fast and simple card game from Bruno Faidutti and Michael Schacht, designers of such games as Citadels, Coloretto and Fist of Dragonstones. This exciting and unique card game invites players to compete to get the best directors and most famous actors for their films. With an easily accessible theme, and simple but deep gameplay, The Hollywood Card Game appeals as much to casual gamers as it does to hardcore strategists.&#10;&#10;The game plays over 3-4 rounds (the same number as the number of players), with each player having one turn to play first. Each round a new Hollywood Area is created by shuffling 3 Star cards and 11 Movie cards together and dealing them out into 4 columns. Players take turns either placing a marker on the bottom card of a column (pushing the preceding markers up the column), or playing one of their Studio cards (Skip a turn, or take two turns in a row). Each studio card can only be used once per game. Once each card in a column has a marker on it, that column is closed, and no more markers have been played in this column.&#10;&#10;Once all players have run out of markers, the round is over, and cards are allocated to players based on the marker on the card, and starting from the TOP left corner. Cards are allocated one at a time, and must be used on a Project immediately. Film cards must be allocated to a Project of the same genre (Horror, Action, or Romantic Comedy), or allocated to a new project if the player does not already have a Project of that genre. Star cards must be allocated to any project, however this will immediately complete a Movie, which no more cards can be added to. If a Star card cannot be allocated to a project, they cannot be held to add to a later project. Movies score points for the number of Film cards in them (with Award Film cards counting twice), multiplied by the number of stars on the Star card. Blockbuster cards stand alone and are worth 2 points each. Additionally, each player scores one point for each Film card in their largest unfinished project (no ties allowed). The player with the most points wins. If players are tied, the player with the single most valuable movie is the winner.&#10;&#10;The Hollywood Card Game contains 64 cards, 16 film reel chips, and a rule sheet. The game is suitable for three to four players Ages 8 and up&#10;&#10;"

15889,,"Scopa is a traditional Italian card game (actually a family of card games that includes Scopone, Scopetta, and Scopone Scientifico) played in regions of Italy for over 400 years.  The game is played with a 40-card Italian deck (similar to a conventional deck minus either the 8s, 9s, and 10s or alternatively, the Js,  Qs, and Ks).  Four-player games are usually played in partnership; other numbers of players typically play for themselves.&#10;&#10;In the original Scopa base game, four cards are turned face up on the table, and players are dealt hands of three cards.  On their turn, a player may capture any of the face-up cards on the table if the sum of the cards captured equals the value of the card played.  If a player cannot make a capture, they must discard a card face-up onto the table.  Cards are progressively handed out in lots of three until the deck is exhausted.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, scoring is calculated.  Players earn 1 point for &quot;sweeping&quot; the table, that is, for clearing the table of all face-up cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards of the coin suit; 1 point for capturing the 7 of coins (the &quot;settebello&quot;); and 1 point for the best &quot;primiera,&quot; that is, the best assemblage of high-value cards from each of the four suits.&#10;&#10;The game is traditionally played until a player or team reaches a set number of points, usually 11 or 21.&#10; The name &quot;Scopa&quot; means &quot;sweep&quot; or &quot;broom&quot; in Italian, and refers to the action of picking up all face-up cards on the table.&#10;&#10;In some ways, Scopa can be thought of as a precursor to many popular modern game designs.  The multiple competing goals and the limited hand-size make for a very modern-feeling game.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Gelb gewinnt!&#10;    Der Goldene Kompass: Das Kartenspiel zum Film&#10;    Shokoba&#10;    Templaria&#10;    Punto&#10;    Casino&#10;    Frog Juice&#10;&#10;&#10;"

15957,,"Final Fantasy VIII contained a sub game called &quot;Triple Triad.&quot;  This game was actually sold in card form.  Boosters only.  10 cards per booster.  5 game cards, 5 visual art cards.  No modifications made.  Now internet play has been fan-made.  Only published in Japan to my knowledge.&#10;&#10;Basically, this is a modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe.  Play is on a 3x3 grid.  Each player has 5 cards he does not show the other player.  Cards are two-sided, one pink, one blue.  Cards are based on characters and monsters from the game.  There are &quot;levels&quot; of cards, each level containing monsters, guardian forces (summon monsters), or player characters (highest level).  Each player chooses a color.  Randomly determine who goes first.  Place a card on the grid.  Each card has a &quot;compass rose&quot; of 4 different numbers, 1-9, and then A representing 10.  Higher levels contain higher numbers.  If I place a card with the number 4 at it's north, and you place a card with a number 5 at it's south directly above mine, you &quot;flip&quot; mine, and both are now your color.  You are trying to get the most cards to your color.  You can &quot;chain&quot; cards too.  If you flip a card, it can flip other cards.  Each card is only flipped once per turn.  Some cards have an elemental symbol on them, giving a +1 number bonus against anything not of that element.&#10;&#10;The nice thing is you only need 5 cards.  In FFVIII, you could actually take one of your opponent's cards they played with if you won.  House rules for this type of play vary.&#10;&#10;"
