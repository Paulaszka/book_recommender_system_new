On the Adriatic, the Austrio-Hungarian fleet is outnumbered and out gunned, more to 2-1 in both categories.

Players take turns throwing dice and calling out a name with two initials on the dice.  A successful name means moving a space.  Players are limited in time to call out a successful name by a unique timer.  The timer works by releasing a ball at the top of a ramp leading to a circular funnel type pit.  It takes approximately 10 seconds for the ball to settle into the center pit.  Players start with 4 dice and work down to 2 dice near the end of the board.  A category die is also included when the players have advanced far enough on the board.  First to the end wins.&#10;&#10;

The game is a departure from the regular approach to fantasy skirmish games - combat feels more like an all-out brawl rather than organized groups of fighters rolling dice at each other. You can almost feel the pain of the fighters as they hurl themselves into battle. Once the players get a grip on the rules games are usually over in under an hour, which is crucial to those who have to squeeze real life in between them. Physical space required is also&#10;small - most 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; terrain boards are ideal; kitchen tables will suffice, though, and may even produce a tighter battle.&quot;&#10;&#10;The rules were designed to be used with 28mm figures. &quot;[O]ne figure represents one warrior, beast or frothing lunatic, so the effect of a single figure on the game is of great importance.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Every figure has a profile, a set of equipment (weapons, armour, etc.) and possibly some 'special abilities.'&quot; The profile for a figure consists of nine categories plus any special abilities. Special abilities include Berserker, Camouflage, Creature of Darkness, Fanatic, Flier, Giantslayer, Invisible, Musician, Night Vision, Teleporter, Undead, and Were-Creature.&#10;&#10;The game includes rules on creating characters, companies, and setting up games using scenario creation tables.
