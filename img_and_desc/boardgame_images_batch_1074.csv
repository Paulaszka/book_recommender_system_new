In 1947, the Truman Doctrine provided American aid to Greece to help contain communism. Greece was in the midst of a civil war between communist fighters and the Government army supported by a coalition of right-wing and centrist forces. Greek Tragedy recreates this conflict in a team card driven format.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The game focuses on the peak phase of the conflict, led by the Campaign before and after the so-called &quot;Annual Disaster&quot; (1921), which caused the death in combat of thousands of Spanish soldiers. A tragic episode that would decisively mark the political and military future of Spain during the two incoming decades.&#10;&#10;Tribute of Blood is a card driven game, with a map of areas that replicates the domains of the Riffian tribes, and a network of connected spaces that allow a &ldquo;point to point&rdquo; movement through a rugged territory, suitable for ambushes and surprise raids The basic mechanics consist of the use of action points to deploy movement, logistics, offensive and diplomatic operations. The events of the cards will serve as drivers of these actions, while providing the necessary &quot;historical flavor&quot;. During each game turn, players will be able to launch raids, incursions, charges, sieges, assaults..., as well as pressure their opponent with various diplomatic actions.&#10;&#10;In Tribute of Blood, one player represents the Spanish Army and another the Riffian rebels. The game can be summarized in a pendulum movement, with both sides adopting offensive and defensive postures during different phases of the Campaign: the Rif side enjoys the initiative during the first turns and has the chance to cause a disaster similar to the historical one in Spanish lines. Starting on turns 6 and 7, the Spanish reinforcements will even the scales and provide the opportunity to regain control of the territory and avenge their deaths. The game is asymmetrical in many of its mechanics, beginning with the different positional &quot;habitat&quot; of each of the contenders: the Spanish formations move from point to point, through connection lines, while the Riffian rebels (harcas) unfold and move inside and through the areas (Cabilas). This means that there is not a defined combat front, and the Spanish must launch constant incursions to confront Abd-el Krim's warriors. It is a simulation of an irregular and asymmetric warfare, with interesting innovations on mechanics and interactions.&#10;&#10;Tribute of Blood consists of the following scenarios, each with an increasing level of depth and complexity:&#10;&#10;- 1. Historical Scenario: &quot;Annual's Disaster&quot; (5 turns)&#10;- 2. Alternative Scenario: &quot;Avoiding Disaster&quot; (5 turns)&#10;- 3.

Each of these ships have different attributes in regards to bonuses they receive in movement, cannon power, and defenses.&#10;&#10;Rather than chess-style movement, each turn the wind will (or may not) change direction, effecting all of the ships ability to sail on certain headings. Learn the actual points of sail used by sailers to maximize your movement and chart the best course to play the wind and best your opponents.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a randomly generated chest of treasure will surface somewhere in the play area, creating an ever shifting goal for you while you fend off other players and dodge cannon fire. Win the game by being the last one afloat with most treasure when the turn-based timer runs out and the hurricane hits. Randomly generated wind, treasure locations, unnavigable-island tiles, and up to 8 players make for different play styles and outcomes with every session.&#10;&#10;"

Bad hands must be mitigated by careful card play and benefitting from other players' card play.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved quickly with the attacker choosing their level of risk. The defenders must be prepared with adequate defensive ships and cards in their tableau.&#10;&#10;Each game contains a hundred wooden ships and agents, 18 custom engraved dice, a beautiful six-panel board, and tons of cards with over 60 pieces of unique art. The base game may be played without the optional Leaders and Lore cards (for an easier teach) or with them for a richer, fuller and asymmetric game. It is also the core of the campaign game (requiring the Blighted Reach Expansion), which provides an epic, more thematic experience.&#10;&#10;"

Rouse your companions!&#10;&#10;In the First Watch box, you&rsquo;ll find 85 verse cards suited by the Fruit of the Spirit. These are divided into a 50-card Lightraider deck and a 35-card Battle deck. You&rsquo;ll also find rule cards plus a key card to help you use this deck with other Lightraiders games. The Battle deck includes the cards you need to score victories. These are verses used when battling allegorical enemies in the Lightraiders realm.&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t remember the verse referenced on the battle card in play, use a lightraider card from your hand that matches its suit. Or recite a verse from a card in an opponent&rsquo;s hand. Of course, you can only see the reference on the back of your opponent&rsquo;s card, so you&rsquo;ll have to rely on memory.&#10;&#10;Lightraiders play this game on the road and at Lightraider Academy to practice sacred verses and prepare for battle. Now you can play First Watch at home. Even better, use your First Watch cards for organization and reference during other lightraider adventures. This set makes a great companion to the original DragonRaid Vintage Boxed Set or Starlots the Game. Game effects are listed on each card, and each card also incorporates a real-life Scripture application to expand your discipleship learning.&#10;&#10;Intended as Bible memory verse tool that has been gamified to support an expanded/enhanced play method for DragonRaid and/or Starlots.&#10;&#10;"

The goal: to stay sick by guarding against large microbes or by catching those of others.&#10;&#10;Players receive a microbe card (value 1-10) and three more are placed in front of the card shuffler (brewer). Starting with the player to the left of the brewer, the latter will secretly look at his card and may be able to keep it, or exchange with the next player. The exchange is automatically accepted, unless the player under a Atchoum! of value 10, which means that the exchange is refused and that both players must keep their original card. When the turn of the brewer comes, he can keep his card, or else, having no one left with whom to trade, replace it with one of the three in front of him.&#10;&#10;When the round ends, the player(s) with the lowest value card loses the round and a box of tissues.&#10;&#10;Microbes est un jeu familial simple qui amuse tant les plus jeunes que les parents.&#10;Le but : rester malade en garde pour soi les gros microbes ou en attrapant ceux des autres.&#10;Deroulement: Apr&egrave;s avoir pris leurs jetons bo&icirc;tes de mouchoirs, chaque joueur re&ccedil;oit une carte microbe (d'une valeur de 1 &agrave; 10) et trois autres sont plac&eacute;s devant le brasseur de cartes.

The two friends are 'dream world dwellers', and the aim is to make all their dreams come true together with them.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a character to help the friends, and some numbered cards they keep secret. The player lays their cards face-down in front of them, from lowest to highest, with the negative numbers to the left, and the positive to the right of their character. In tis way, players give an idea to each other what cards they might hold.&#10;&#10;The dream world is a set of Dream cards laid out face-down in the middle of the table. The cards are staggered from one to four and back to one. The players must guide the two friends R&#197;&#171; and K&#197;&#171; on a path through these dreams, but they only win if they can complete all seven steps.&#10;&#10;Each time a Dream card is turned up, the players decide which number card they will contribute. They have to combine their cards to add exactly to the one of the numbers on the Dream card. So if the Dream card has a number 1, players can use a +5, -3, -4 and +3 to get a total of 1. Players can discuss what they might offer, but not the exact values of their cards.&#10;&#10;If the players fail to satisfy one Dream card, the game is lost.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"
