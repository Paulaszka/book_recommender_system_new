A handful of clich&eacute; characters have managed to survive the onslaught by holing at the center of the town. But a rescue never comes. Worse still, the zombies are beginning to gather on the town. As their numbers grow, so does a strange intelligence in the undead hordes. Time grows short. If the characters wish to survive they have to do it themselves by escaping to the outskirts of the town.&#10;&#10;In Posthumous, half the players will command a single cliche character apiece, while the other half direct hordes of themed zombies. The town's layout, characters' and zombies strengths and weaknesses are all randomized each game, making every play through a distinguished experience. While on the surface, Posthumous's humor celebrates the proud history of the Zombie Flick, the game is at its core one of cunning and tactical use of your entire team's abilities.&#10;&#10;Posthumous's unique mechanics reduce downtime and keep the players plotting, laughing, and guessing. Games of up 10 players can expect their games to last no longer than games with only 4.&#10;&#10;"

It features the Mafia Lemming characters from the cartoon.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&quot;Real lemmings want to jump off the next cliff. Members of the different lemming mafia families aren't any different. Because in the game, there is not only one, but six members of the suicidal species, they make a contest out of it. They all run to the lake and the first one who jumps in the lake wins. And it wouldn't be a real race if you couldn't place bets on the result. Each player has his favorite lemmings and tries to use the dice results to influence the race.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has 6 cards (1/lemming), and 2 mission cards (bonus VP at end of game). On your turn, roll two dice (sides show one of the lemming colors) then choose to move one of those lemmings (if one is out of the race, move the lemming in last place). Lemmings may move one track section at a time, to any unoccupied space in the next section. The spaces on the race track are one of several types (e.g., give a lemming concrete shoe; 2=dead, remove concrete, allow you to place bets, move a lemming, etc.).&#10;&#10;Betting is interesting: each time, you have the option to bet. To do so, place a lemming card face down on top of your stack of bet cards; goal is to place winner on TOP of your stack (last bet placed).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a lemming reaches the finish; place remaining lemmings in the order they are on the track. Mission cards score bonus VP if completed, or cost VP if failed. Then resolve bets: turn over your cards, then go through them getting 1 VP per card revealed until you get to winning lemming (max 6 VP).&#10;&#10;"

They are obtained in one of three ways: rolling a question mark on the included custome dice, landing on a question mark on the board, or if your character is moved to a room as part of someone starting a rumor (equivalent to Clue's &quot;making a suggestion.&quot;)  The first two situations incur a forced draw, while the third is optional.  There are eight clock cards in the intrigue deck, and if you draw the eighth card then you automatically lose.  Keepers give a one-time bonus that allow you to slightly alter some of the game's parameters...risk of drawing a clock; potential reward of benefiting from a keeper.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each of the six characters have a &quot;personality card&quot; which alows for a one-time power.
