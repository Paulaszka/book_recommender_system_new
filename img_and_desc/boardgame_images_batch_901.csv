Crew quality determines if a ship is able to activate and also the speed at which they reload.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

291065,,"Departure on the Nile puts 2 to 4 players in the 1830s to 1880s in Egypt. During this period, Egypt under its rulers and the increased influence of Europeans experienced a tremendous upswing. The first railway lines were built, cotton was grown and exported, the Suez Canal was opened, as well as schools and hospitals built on the European model. Not least, the country also opened up for the emerging mass tourism, which brought a large number of people in the land of the pharaohs and pyramids. The players in Departure on the Nile embody young investors from Europe who want to contribute to the expansion of the country and invest in the Egyptian economy, solely with the aim of achieving the greatest fortune. Departure on the Nile is a classic worker placement game in which each player starts the game with only three of their own colonial officials. The construction of buildings, however, bring specialists into the country, who can recruit players using a novel mechanism (felucca travel and rail travel) and from now on can use. The game comes with a high level of interaction so it does not have the character of a multiplayer solitaire game. All players are involved at all times, whether through the use of the buildings (owners receive a bonus), by rail travel or the use of the Suez Canal where players can receive money and influence through their share certificates. Since the game is all about earning the most money at the end of the game, every investment in the game should be well considered. The game material is relatively extensive, the random game structure (bonus tiles, majority tiles, building tiles, personalities) guarantees a long game stimulus that prevents deadlocked strategies.&#10;&#10;"

Despite being outnumbered, Lee wins the 3-day combat and takes advantage of his good defensive position before launching a counter attack that disperses Pope&rsquo;s troops.

The goal is to take down the Shogun of the other player by moving your own pieces, similar to Chess or Shogi.&#10;However, it has the following distinctive features.&#10;&#10;&#10;     You are free to place the soldier pieces anywhere you want at the beginning of the game. The players take turns, placing 1 piece per turn. The placement of the pieces shall be determined with ever-evolving strategies while watching the moves and battle formation of the other player.  &#10;     There are only 3 different kinds of soldier pieces.&#10;     You are not able to move the pieces immediately during your turn. You may only move them according to the commands issued by &ldquo;cards&rdquo; in the previous turn. It is not guaranteed that the game pieces will move as expected. &#10;     When pieces of the same kind are aligned next to each other, either in a vertical and horizontal direction, you may move them together in the same turn, up to more than 2 pieces at once. &#10;&#10;&#10;For example, 3 Infantry pieces in a row may move forward at the same time or multiple Archer pieces may shoot arrows at the same time. In order to win, it is key to establish a good set-up/formation for yourself and break up the set-up/formation of the other player. &#10;&#10;     After the initial placement,  the players decide in secret which game piece will become the Shogun piece, which is the defining piece for winning or losing the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;It is crucial to predict the Shogun of your opponent during the game play. &#10; In order to get a taste of being a real military strategist, we created this game for 2 players and added game elements that will hopefully remove unrealistic game elements that we had experienced in other strategy simulation games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Then you have a big chance of winning the neon party game!&#10;&#10;The player tries to get many points as possible on his house number. The players don't know each other's house number. There are 2 sets of house numbers cards 1-5. One of them are placed in the middle of the table. Each player receives a secret housenumber from the other set of 1-5.&#10;&#10;The rest of the cards consist cards with numbers -5 (defect neon lights) to 5(working neon lights) and a few special cards. These cards form the draw pile. If it is a players turn, he will take a card from the draw pile. He can place this card on both sides of a house number. Then it's the next players turn and he does the same. If there is a total of 5 cards on both sides of a house number, there is a scoring. &#10;First, it is determined which side of this house number has the most cards. The side with the most cards will be placed on table below the house number card. For the order house numbers, the same side will be placed below the house number card. The entire other side of the house numbers with cards will be placed on the discard pile. After this, there are no more neon light cards on table (except below the house numbers and the discard pile). Then the game continues. If there are 5 cards placed at a house number another scoring takes place. The game ends when the draw pile is used up.&#10;&#10;There are 2 special cards with which you can remove cards and do 2 turns in a row.&#10;&#10;The players then guess from each other which house number they have.
