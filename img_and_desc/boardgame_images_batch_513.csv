Since no stones are ever removed from the board, cycles are not possible.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn this rules, adjacent always means orthogonally adjacent.&#10;&#10;A group is a set of like-colored, adjacent stones.&#10;&#10;A liberty is an empty point adjacent to a group. A false liberty is an empty point which is adjacent to at least one stone of each color and no empty points. Liberties which are not false are true.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayStarting with Black, the players take turns placing stones with their color showing on empty points of the board, one stone per turn.&#10;&#10;After a placement, all enemy groups with no true liberties are flipped, i.e. all the stones in them are turned round to show the player's color, after which the turn ends.&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, every group on the board must have at least one true liberty. Otherwise, the move is illegal and the player must choose another one.&#10;&#10;Players can pass their turn at any moment. When both players pass in succession, the game ends, and the one with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;A player's score is the number of stones with his color showing that there are on the board, plus a komi (see below) in the case of White. In the event of a tie, whoever made the last move loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;KomiThe komi is the even number of points which are added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player tells his opponent the even number which will be used as komi, and then the second player chooses which color to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Author's notesA very interesting, non-obvious feature of Loose is that, assuming that players will only pass their turn when there are no more useful moves available, the game will never end in a tie. In Go, ties can occur if there is an odd number of empty points in seki, but seki patterns in Loose always involve an even number of them. The tie-break rule is just included to make the game theoretically drawless, rather than just in practice.&#10;&#10;"

Players take on the role of one of four characters from the show, Elena, Stefan, Damon or Bonnie, and begin the game in possession of a photo-frame portraying their character as a human. A switch in the back of the photo-frame can be used to transform the photo into that of a vampire, and the object of the game is to avoid receiving three bite marks, thereby being the last remaining human.&#10;&#10;Game play occurs in turns with players moving a dry erase vampire marker/mover around a simple game board. In turn, each player rolls three dice marked with crows and moves the marker/mover zero to three spaces clockwise, depending on the number of crows rolled. The space the marker lands on allows the player to use the top portion of the vampire mover to apply a dry erase vampire bite stamp to another player's photo-frame, erase one of his or her own vampire bites with the supplied dry erase pad, swap photos with another player, or gain control of the Family Crest Ring which protects that player from vampire bites. A roll of zero crows does not move the marker, instead automatically gaining control of the Family Crest Ring for the player who rolled the zero.&#10;&#10;When a player receives the third vampire bite on his photo-frame, he can no longer win the game, erase bites, swap photos or possess the Family Crest Ring. However, he can remain in the game, taking turns as normal, but only dealing out vampire bites as allowed. The last player without three vampire bites wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
