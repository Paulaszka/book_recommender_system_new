In April 1848, two British officers were sent to the prosperous south western city of Multan to take over the running of the province from its governor, Diwan Mulraj Chopra. They were murdered by soldiers of the city&rsquo;s garrison, apparently acting spontaneously and without the prior knowledge of the startled Mulraj. Nonetheless, after some prevarication, he supported their actions, and thereby found himself the leader of a rebellion against the British.&#10;There were few Sikhs in that part of the Punjab: the garrison was mainly Muslim, and the Mulraj was a Hindu. Because of this, the East India Company regarded the uprising as a purely local affair and sent troops to lay siege to Multan in the expectation that this would quell the rebellion. These included a large body of Sikhs, supposedly loyal to the British, under the command of Sher Singh.&#10;&#10;It is now late October 1848. Coming to sympathize with the Mulraj&rsquo;s grievances against the British and to appreciate how these are shared by the Sikhs, Sher Singh has changed sides.   His men have withdrawn from the siege and are marching north east towards the Punjabi capital, Lahore. Sher Singh&rsquo;s father, Chattar Singh, has also rebelled against the British and is besieging the fort at Attock which guards the road to Afghanistan. Inspired by the defiance of Sher Singh and Chattar Singh, anti-British disturbances have broken out in towns and cities across the western Punjab.&#10;&#10;In response, units of the British East India Company are assembling at Firozpur where they will become the &ldquo;Army of the Punjab&rdquo;, under the command of Lord Gough. Gough plans to march against Sher Singh before he is reinforced by Chattar Singh. The monsoon season has ended. Campaigning can commence. So begins the Second Anglo-Sikh War 1848 &ndash; 1849.&#10;&#10;Into the Lion&rsquo;s Mouth is a two-player beer-and-pretzels game which gives players the opportunity to replicate the British success in re-establishing control over the Punjab, or to re-write history by leading the Sikhs to victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Written by Gen Z parents living the COVID life 24/7 with Gen Z kids, the game exudes its own version of twisted humor.&#10;&#10;Players initially race around the board, buying up stock before the value collapses. While doing that, you are spreading a virus wherever you go, drawing notification cards (made from the insane things that have happened in 2020), and collecting toilet paper and homeopathy pills. Eventually, as spaces get quarantined, players are forced into the Bunker for the Lockdown Round.&#10;&#10;At any point in the game if any one player dies from too much virus the game ends. You have to work together to stay alive, while also trying to get the most resources. Once the game ends players count their resources to win &quot;Trophies.&quot; Trophies can be won for things like holding the most stock, the most toilet paper, AND (of course) a &quot;Participation Trophy&quot; for the individual who loses so - trophies for everyone!&#10;&#10;The player with the most trophies wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The game title translates more literally as Theory Of The Moving Heavens. Geocentric Theory (often simplified as Ptolemaic Theory) puts the Earth at the centre of the Universe.&#10;&#10;The players sail their ships on the oceans, searching for the treasure island of the Pirate King. But if they sail too close to the edge of the world, over they go!&#10;&#10;The game includes an Armillary sphere to help the players navigate. There is a day phase and  a night phase. During the day, the navigator reads the winds and the waves, and at night, the stars. When an undiscovered island is found, players can search for clues to the location of the gold and silver treasures.&#10;&#10;As well as the 20cm tall sphere, the game also has the sea in a box. When it is not their turn, a player moves the box around to bring the sound of the sea alive.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"
