The players get to choose their own route. When they get to city with a red number, the players get a game marker. Most of the rules are left open to agreement by the players before the start of the game. To win the game, the player either has to be the first to reach the Destination, or get the most game markers. Which goal is used has to be agreed upon before the game starts.&#10;&#10;The game was published in the 1930s/1940s, so the game board shows the German borders of this time.

There are also diplomatic actions on some fleets, systems, and action cards.&#10;&#10;5) Battle. At every system with more than one fleet there will be a battle where every ship gets to shoot once. Each fleet has different initiative numbers for its ships, describing when they get to act. Late ships risk being shot down before they have a chance to fire. During battle, players can also use battle actions on action cards, upgrade cards, fleets, and escort ships. Most battle actions cost energy from the fleet. If a flagship is destroyed, its owner must immediately retreat all surviving escort ships from that battle and discard the fleet.&#10;&#10;6) Reward. Players get 1 VP for each system they have to themselves (The first player to reach 7 VP is the winner.). Then each fleet gets energy from its reactor and resources from the system where they are located. Then each player gets 2 diplomatic points, 6 megacredits, and an action card, and then the next round can begin.&#10;&#10;"

Another player can try to seize neutral property or someone else's property by attacking the guard. All fighter cards have different special abilities on them.

Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.&#10;&#10;Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory.&#10;&#10;"

When an attack occurs, the player with the more powerful animal ON THAT DAY wins the attack and stays in the game.

For example, while the Lion (20) on most days is more powerful than most animals, during a flood, the strength of the Crocodile rises to 21 and will defeat the Lion this day.

As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?&#10;&#10;Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).&#10;&#10;But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.&#10;&#10;On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.&#10;&#10;After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.&#10;&#10;To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.&#10;&#10;Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.&#10;&#10;"

At any time, a player may spend one of their two veto chips to veto another player's move, announcing a new restriction under which that move is illegal (such as &quot;players may not move more than six stations in a turn&quot;). In doing so, the players gradually build a set of restrictions for how the game is to be played. Play continues until a player is able to reach Mornington Crescent without having their move vetoed.&#10;&#10;By framing all discussion of additional rules as mere &quot;reminders&quot; of a deeper, undisclosed ruleset, the game appears to an audience to be a fully-formed boardgame rather than something that the players are largely inventing on the fly.&#10;&#10;Although the game bears some superficial resemblance to Mornington Crescent, and exercises some transferrable skills, the two games are very different, with distinct tournament structures and governing bodies, and should not be confused.&#10;&#10;"

It has an endless number of variations, so the summary below will deal with the most common rules in use today.&#10;&#10;Chicago is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The object of the game is to score points by having the best poker hand. Each poker hand is assigned a point value (p), as follows:&#10;&#10;1p &mdash; One Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g.: A, 10, 10, 6, 2).&#10;2p &mdash; Two Pair: Two pairs of different ranks (e.g.: K, K, J, 4, 4).&#10;3p &mdash; Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 6).&#10;4p &mdash; Straight: Five cards in rank sequence (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7).&#10;5p &mdash; Flush: Five cards of the same suit (e.g.: A, J, 10, 7, 3; all diamonds).&#10;6p &mdash; Full House: Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 9). &#10;7p &mdash; Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g.: J, J, J, J, 8).&#10;9p &mdash; Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7; all diamonds).&#10;&#10;Points are also awarded for taking the last trick of each round (5 points), or for scoring a &quot;Chicago&quot; by taking all five tricks of the round (15 or 25 points, must be declared by calling &quot;Chicago&quot; before any trick is played).&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a pre-determined number of points (typically 50, 52, or 100) wins the game.&#10;&#10;Common scoring variants include awarding an automatic &quot;Chicago&quot; for a holder of a straight flush instead of the normal points awarded for that hand at the end of the round. Others award points equal to the game goal (50, 52, or 100) if the straight flush is also &quot;Royal&quot; (meaning, ranks A, K, Q, J, 10).&#10;&#10;Playing a round&#10;&#10;Each player (including the dealer) is dealt 5 cards after which 3 phases follow. Before each phase, the players are allowed to discard any unwanted cards face down to the central playing area and are dealt an equal number of replacement cards.&#10;&#10;First and Second Phase&#10;&#10;Each player may now declare any poker hand which they hold (honor system). Highest hand scores points according to the value of the poker hand combination. The other players do not score. In the case of a tie, highest card used to score the hand wins (highest triple in the event of a full house). If still tied, highest non-scoring card breaks the tie. If still tied, each tied player scores full points.&#10;&#10;Variant: If you scored a poker hand, but discard at least one of the scoring cards before the next phase, you must simply announce that you are &quot;not keeping&quot; your hand.&#10;&#10;Third Phase&#10;&#10;The player to the left of the dealer leads out by playing a card in front of themselves. Each other player must follow suit, if able. The winner of the trick leads out the following trick, and so on.&#10;&#10;It is important for all players to keep their own cards separated from other player cards. All played cards should be clearly visible to all players.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the first trick, and only during the first trick, before a player has played their card, they may call &quot;Chicago&quot;. Should this happen, all players gather any cards they played back into their hand (as applicable) and the player who called &quot;Chicago&quot; will lead out instead. In order to score a successful &quot;Chicago&quot;, all five tricks must be won, no exceptions.&#10;&#10;Round Scoring&#10;&#10;The winner of the fifth and last trick scores 5 points (variant: score 10 points if you won the trick with a 2). As was done during the first two phases, the best poker hand also scores. If a successful &quot;Chicago&quot; was played, no other points are scored. A failed &quot;Chicago&quot; instead results in the caller receiving a score penalty equal to the points normally awarded (-15 or -25 points). A cumulative negative score is possible.&#10;&#10;At the end of scoring, if any player has reached the pre-determined final score, the game ends. Otherwise, or in the event of a tie, play continues. Deal passes to the left. The entire deck is re-shuffled before the initial deal each round.&#10;&#10;"

If any of YOUR manatees are face up, you may move one of them toward their home location. If you have face up manatee cards that are adjacent to each other, any adjacent manatee can follow the card that moved by moving into the space it just left, and an adjacent manatee can follow that card, and so on.

This requires thoughtful play, as the control each player has over which colors are painted is indirect.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player is assigned a goal with two colors -- one color that will grant them points, and another that will cause them to lose points. A player's positive goal is public, while their negative goal is private. Players must work to influence the painting process so as to maximize their positive goal color, and minimize their negative goal color.&#10;&#10;Of course, this is easier said than done. Players can only affect the colors that are painted by controlling the location of a shared set of tokens on a color palette. These tokens are moved between sections of the palette by mixing together color cards from a communal pile that all players must play cards into. Players can also play action cards to affect the location of tokens, and the availability of color cards to mix.&#10;&#10;Timing is a critical aspect of Mix!, as players can only take one of three possible actions each turn -- either combining color cards to influence the palette, taking on new bonus objectives, or painting. Painting results in all players gaining and losing points based on the state of the palette, and also allows players to complete their bonus objectives. As a result, players must choose carefully when to work to influence the palette versus when to paint, in order to maximize their own gains while minimizing those of their opponents.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, private goals are revealed, and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"

Play continues until either the victory or defeat conditions are met.&#10;&#10;Each turn follows this sequence of play:&#10;&#10;     Union Build Phase: The Union player builds units (Armies, Gunboats, General, Fleet, Forts) during this phase. In addition, a Union General may be sacked. &#10;     Union Move Phase: Union units may move Regions this phase. &#10;     Union Combat Phase: Any combat resulting from Union movement is resolved. &#10;     Rebel Build Phase: The Rebels may build units as permitted by certain circumstances. &#10;     Rebel Move Phase: Rebel Generals may move as permitted by die roll. &#10;     Rebel Combat Phase. Any combat resulting from Rebel movement is resolved. &#10;&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to prevent the Rebellion from having resources available to build and maintain their army. Once this achieved, the Union player wins. If the Rebellion ever controls four Union areas or Washington DC, the Union player loses.&#10;&#10;"

While primarily a solitaire game, the special edition also contains optional two player rules.&#10;&#10;The player controls the German forces and must battle the Russian Army to control as many regions of Stalingrad as possible. The game is played by deploying German units on a map of Stalingrad. The AI (or an optional second player) controls the Russian forces through movement, placement, and attack rules.&#10;&#10;The game plays out over 15 turns (although shorter scenarios are provided). Each turn, the player will place Russian forces in the Ferry areas on the Volga River (these units are placed upside down and are not revealed until attacked). The German player will then raise troops and move units to instigate combat. The AI rules then dictate how the Russian units will counter attack and conduct movement.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by controlling all the Urban areas of Stalingrad at the end of a turn. The game can end early if the player achieves the victory conditions before the end of turn 15. If the player doesn't control the Urban areas by the end of the game, it is a loss.&#10;&#10;"

The self-destruction mechanism has been triggered and players only have 5 minutes to kill the aliens blocking their way to the emergency exit hatch.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt six face-down alien cards showing the hit pattern to complete in order to kill the alien. The hit patterns consist in 4 or 5 dice in various colors and values. When the game starts, a timer is triggered, all players flip the first card in their deck, and then simultaneously roll dice as fast as they can, in order to complete the hit patterns lying in front of them. Once a pattern is complete, the player flips the next card and starts rolling dice again to complete the new pattern revealed. Dice can (and in some cases must) be passed between players to complete their patterns.&#10;&#10;If all players manage to complete all the patterns they were dealt at the beginning of the game, they reach the escape pod safely and leave the space station unharmed. However, if the timer reaches zero before all patterns are completes, the space station explodes with aliens and humans aboard, and everyone lose.&#10;&#10;"

You could skip this part for younger players. With the questions, it makes it an educational game. It is easy to teach and learn. There are also joker cards counting as any card. You score points for the amount of runs you have down. You also score negative points for the cards in your hand once the game ends. The worst card to end up with in your hand is a joker, losing you 50 points. The winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;"

Inspired by the countless movies of that genre, you race down a long (it almost seems endless) straight, ever-changing highway, trying to kill off all your competitors, run over the most valuable pedestrians, reach the gas station first or a variety of other goals, depending on the scenario you pick. Sometimes you will be on your own, sometimes you will be part of a gang.&#10;&#10;There are many cars, drivers, passengers and equipment available that can be combined freely to build the wheeled killing machine of your dreams. However, the scenario only grants you a certain amount of credit to do so, each car only has a limited load capacity and, of course, the better the gear and the driver, the more expensive.&#10;&#10;Game play is simple and fast. Each turn you change your speed, drive and take an action. You attack your opponents with your mounted guns, molotovs, rockets and more, lay mines or leave oil puddles for the guys behind you to slip in, ram other cars and wracks out of your way. Your ability to do stuff changes, depending on how fast you are going and what you are trying to do. However, only in very few cases you will need to calculate anything, most of that is taken care of by the layout of the game material; You just check your current value and roll a six-sided die. While you will want to stay on the road, circumstances often will force you to drive on the shoulder, where going gets rougher and steering more interesting&hellip;&#10;&#10;Most of the game is free to print and play, you will, however, need small models to represent your cars; Micromachines work well, or any other model of roughly that size.
