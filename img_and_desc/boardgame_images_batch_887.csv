Their newly appointed commander, Mikhail Kutuzov, had chosen his ground wisely. The marshy and wooded terrain around the village favoured the defender and Kutuzov strengthened his position still further by fortifying many of the natural obstacles. Here the Russians waited.&#10;&#10;Far from friendly territory, short of supplies, and with Winter approaching, Napoleon had little choice but to attack in order to open the way to the relative safety of Moscow. A series of frontal attacks by both sides resulted in an orgy of slaughter. The fighting involved around 250,000 troops and nearly 70,000 were left on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Both armies suffered terribly; but, it was the Russians who left the field and the way open for the Grande Armee to march on to Moscow. Too exhausted to follow their beaten foe, nearly week was to pass before the leading units entered the city. The victory proved to be pyrrhic. The Russian Tsar Alexander had no intention of suing for peace; but, instead waited for Winter to come to his aid. With supplies running out and the weather worsening, the Grande Armee evacuated the city in October. So began the famous retreat from Moscow.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Borodino is a tactical level two player game covering this bloodiest of battles. One player takes the role of Napoleon, commanding the Grande Armee, and the other of Kutusov leading the Russians. The battle is a source of great debate amongst historians, and players have the opportunity to try some of the options available to both commanders. For example, had Napoleon committed his Imperial Guard, the only significant unit on the battlefield that remained in reserve, or had he heeded the advice of Marshal Davout to try to out-flank the Russian position, might he have succeeded in destroying the Russian army and winning not only the battle, but the entire war?&#10;&#10;The First Battle of Polotsk&#10;&#10;This relatively little-known battle, which took place on 17 August 1812, was one of the most significant of Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of Russia. Leading the majority of his Grande Armee ever eastwards, Napoleon had reached Smolensk. He had assigned Marshal Oudinot, commander of the II Corps, to protect his northern flank and to test the strength of the Russian forces defending the road to St Petersburg, the Russian capital. It transpired that these comprised only a single Corps, perhaps 25,000 men, commanded by General Wittgenstein. Impatient with Oudinot for failing to attack Wittgenstein, Napoleon dispatched St. Cyr's VI Corps to reinforce II Corps, bringing its strength up to about 32,000 men. The   aim was to defeat the Russians and, if possible, threaten St Petersburg.&#10;&#10;Faulty intelligence lead Oudinot to believe that Wittgenstein was too weak to mount an attack and so split his forces to making it easier for them to forage. He deployed II Corps on the southern bank and VI Corps on the northern bank of the River Dvna. Wittgenstein recognised that this left VI Corps, the weaker of the two, particularly vulnerable. The Russians attacked and heavy fighting ensued; but, the VI Corps fought bravely and held their position. Towards the end of the first day&rsquo;s fighting Marshal Oudinot was seriously wounded and command of both Corps passed to St. Cyr. The second day saw St. Cyr take the initiative. By feigning a retreat he was able to mislead Wittgenstein and suddenly launch a furious attack against the Russian centre and left flank. Just as defeat seemed inevitable, Wittgenstein ordered his cavalry to counterattack. They cut through the advancing enemy units only to be thrown back in confusion by French Cuirassiers.&#10;&#10;At this point, both sides were exhausted and had suffered heavy casualties. Each withdrew to a defensible position where they remained, watching each other, for the next two months until Napoleon&rsquo;s retreat from Moscow saw his northern flank again become the scene of desperate fighting.&#10;&#10;Although tactically it was a French victory, in strategic terms the First battle of Polotsk was a draw. Nonetheless, the strategic significance of the battle was immense. With his northern flank no longer threatened Napoleon was able to continue his advance upon Moscow. A grateful Emperor rewarded St-Cyr with a marshal&rsquo;s baton. The Russian Tsar Alexander was similarly grateful to Wittgenstein. The threat to St Petersburg had been nullified. He awarded Wittgenstein the Order of St George and conferred upon him the title of &quot;Saviour of St Petersburg&quot;.&#10;&#10;The First Battle of Polotsk is a tactical level two player game covering this strategically significant engagement. One player takes the role of Oudinot, commanding two Corps of the Grande Armee, and the other of Wittgenstein leading the Russians. There is a range of  options open to both players to see if they can achieve the decisive and strategically decisive  victory which eluded their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;SHS Games&#10;&#10;The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.  The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.  So whilst the commander has complete freedom to devise a plan, and a good deal when positioning units which have yet to encounter the enemy, once battle is joined the options become increasingly limited and unforeseen events can play a part in determining the outcome.  Nonetheless, even at a tactical level a commander's decisions are crucial in shaping events. The key to success is a sound plan with a margin for error which allows for ill-fortune, the shrewd deployment of units so as to be able to implement that plan, and the timely commitment of reserves.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

One player takes the role of King Charles XII leading his Swedish troops, and the other of Augustus the Strong commanding a Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian army. This is a classic example of a small well-trained and highly motivated army taking on a larger force in a strong defensive position. Victory will go to the player who is best able to exploit the advantages available to him.&#10;&#10;Earlier in War, the Swedes had repulsed attacks on their empire by the Danes, Russians and Poles and had now taken the offensive by invading the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After occupying Warsaw, Charles marched west with the aim of defeating Augustus decisively. On 19 July 1702 the two armies were camped only five miles apart. However, they were separated by a large wood and a swamp. The latter shielded Augustus&rsquo; camp to the north whilst his left flank was protected by the River Nida. Undeterred by this, and by the fact that his army of 12,000 was outnumbered, maybe by as much as two-to-one, by the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanians, Charles advanced through the woods abandoning most of his guns during the march.&#10;&#10;In an effort to secure a decisive victory, Charles&rsquo; strategy was envelope the enemy army. However, this plan was disrupted when the commander of the assault on the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian right flank was killed and the advance halted. The Poles then counter-attacked, but were beaten back by the Swedish infantry, as was an attack by the Saxons across the marsh which separated the centre of the two armies. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the Poles then abandoned Augustus leaving the field and exposing his right flank. Even though Augustus still had the larger army, it was now badly unbalanced and the Swedes immediately began to roll up his right flank. In the chaos that followed, Charles was able to capture most of the enemy&rsquo;s artillery and to turn these guns upon the Saxon-Polish-Lithuanians. However, fierce resistance by Saxon units in the centre and on the left flank allowed most Saxon-Polish-Lithuanian units to withdraw.&#10;&#10;It was certainly a victory, but not the decisive victory for which Charles had been hoping.&#10;&#10;Fraustadt&#10;&#10;This battle between a Swedish army commanded by General Rehnsk&ouml;ld and a Saxon-Polish-Russian force lead by General Schulenburg took place on 13 February 1706.  It has been described as the &ldquo;Swedish Cannae&rdquo; because the Swedish cavalry carried out a double envelopment, encircling the enemy and bringing about a decisive victory reminiscent of Hannibal&rsquo;s success nearly 2,000 years previously. For the loss of only 400 men, the Swedes inflicted 7,000 casualties upon the Saxon-Polish-Russians and captured a similar number.&#10;&#10;Prior to the battle, King Charles XII was contemplating recalling his over-stretched forces from Poland. Indeed, in the lead up to the battle Rehnskold deliberately gave the impression that the Swedes were withdrawing by retreating his 10,000 men towards Fraustadt. This ploy was successful in luring Schlenburg, at the head of 20,000 men, away from a very strong defensive position to pursue the Swedes. With the two armies now facing each other the Swedish cavalry launched repeated attacks on both flanks, eventually routing the enemy cavalry stationed on each.  They then wheeled to attack the rear of the Saxon-Polish-Russian infantry, with devastating results. At the same time the Swedish infantry began moving forward to assault Schulenburg&rsquo;s forces from the front, thereby completing the encirclement. Although the Saxon-Polish-Russian right flank held for a while, under this intense pressure the army soon broke and those who were unable to flee surrendered en mass.&#10;&#10;In terms of Sweden&rsquo;s campaign in Poland, the Battle of Fraustadt had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Rather than abandoning their campaign, the Swedes had become the dominant military power in the region. Before the year was over Saxony would sue for peace.&#10;&#10;Rehnskold had little option but to risk battle with Schlenburg&rsquo;s superior forces for fear that the odds would be tipped even further against him should Augustus the Strong, commanding 8,000 Saxons, join with Schlenburg. Augustus was only a few days&rsquo; march away from Fraustadt. In addition to the standard game, there is a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenario which envisages his arrival on 13 February 1706.   &#10;&#10;&#10;SHS Games&#10;&#10;The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.

The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms. The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.&#10;&#10;It all really started in February of 1895 when Spain unilaterally suspended constitutional guarantees to Cuba and its population. This lead to open revolt on the island and serious retaliatory measures by the Spanish administration of Captain General Weyler, including concentration camps for non-combatants. This was too much for the American press, and as a result, the American public, and eventually U.S. pressure led to Weyler&rsquo;s removal, but not to a decrease in tensions between the US and Spain. And then, the Maine happened. On 15 February, 1898, well into the darkness of the night, the USS Maine, anchored in Havana Harbour to visible enforcement of U.S. interests on the island, blew up. 268 U,S. naval personnel were killed, about 2/3rd of the crew of the vessel. The American press exploded also. Headlines shouted &ldquo;Spanish Treachery&rdquo; and William Randolph Hearts newspapers stirred the pot of American anger vigorously. By late March a Naval Court Of Inquiry set down a judgment that the Maine was destroyed by an external explosion, pointing the finger by implication at the Spanish. Before the end of the following month, the United States would declare war on Spain.&#10;&#10;The object of the game for the United States player is to control the sea areas around the US Atlantic coast and Caribbean Sea to prevent Spanish combatants from supporting their island holdings and to destroy the naval forces of Spain. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to disrupt United States sea control, retain sea control around the Spanish coastline for as long as possible, and destroy United States naval forces. Both players must deploy their naval resources into the sea areas on the map to earn victory points at the end of each turn for areas under their control, blockaded, and for opposing units destroyed.&#10;&#10;Product information&#10;Complexity: 4 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 10&#10;Time Scale: 11 days per turn&#10;Map Scale: variable (area movement maps)&#10;Unit Scale: individual warships&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

(In this case, an Alcubierre design.)  Mankind expands outward in every direction, for 3000 light years, in the next 700 years.&#10;&#10;It is now the year 3000 AD, and after a little less than 700 years of FTL technology, man has created a modest sphere of inhabited systems some 6000 light years in diameter, and a collective population nearing 1 trillion souls.  Many, many systems containing habitable worlds still remain to be explored and colonized within that sphere, yet the expansion relentlessly continues.   A few, planet-bound sapient races have been found, but no other race with space travel (much less FTL capability) has yet to be revealed.&#10;&#10;But the Milky Way galaxy is a vast expanse of hundreds of billions of stars, and despite centuries of FTL drives, Man (or the race of your choosing) has still only seen the smallest fraction of a single percentage point of those star systems.&#10;&#10;Much, much more lies out there, not the least of which is other, star-faring races.  And of those, some are hopefully friendly and open-armed (in some cases, figuratively), some likely paranoid beyond reason, some simply convinced that any species other than their own must be eradicated, but most will likely fall in various places across the spectrum of possibilities.  The diplomatic skills of man will be sorely tested, as may his ability and will to wage interstellar warfare.&#10;&#10;Fourth Millennium is a 4X game for 1 to 6 players, set on a map of the entire Milky Way galaxy &ndash; 100,000 light years in diameter &ndash; where each player will represent a different, interstellar species, and will choose their own path in attempting to carve out the biggest and best empire, encountering a variety of 36, possible alien races, each with its own unique attributes, attitude, and aspirations, not to mention the empires being built by the other players.  The game engine is driven by action points, and the makeup of your empire will dictate how many action points you'll get each turn.  You'll then decide how to use your action points - maintaining existing and building new fleets and armadas, adding more population (and thus more research abilities or even generating victory points), exploring new sectors, conducting player and Autonomous Race diplomacy, and improving research.  You'll also have the chance every turn to improve your technology in four different categories.&#10;&#10;Staying relevant technologically will prove a challenge.  Some alien races you encounter may be more advanced than you&hellip;and not happy about your presence on their doorstep.  Indeed, you may even need to ally with other players in order to whittle down a common threat.&#10;&#10;And during your explorations, you may find multiple artifacts, left behind by a long-gone race.  They are key to understanding new technologies and improving your overall civilization.  But be forewarned. Those who left behind these artifacts - which we call &quot;The Phobe&quot; - are still observing, may decide to intervene, and if so, with the sole intent of destroying all, competing star-faring races. And they are quite capable of doing so.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

A huge rock smashes a tree near the location of the daredevils and a terrible roar breaks the silence as a Troll throws himself into a mad charge. A battle to the death has begun!&#10;&#10;Each player has a unique deck of cards, and each card has symbols on it to indicate possible actions. The Trolls can move around the game board, attack, throw rocks, charge, and defend themselves from attacks; the Knights can attack with their swords, shoot bows, move individually or in groups, protect themselves with shields, and call reinforcements.&#10;&#10;Each player can have up to six cards in hand, and managing these cards and maneuvering their characters on the game board are the keys to victory. Has the opponent run out of defense cards? Can a Troll nip the strongest Knight and take him out without opening himself up to attacks from the others? The Knights can attack the Trolls' vital areas to keep them from charging or throwing rocks.&#10;&#10;If the Trolls kill the Knights before the end of the battle &ndash; they win. If the Knights survive or defeat the Trolls, they will return home victorious over the menacing monsters.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

World war, the world enters a new political configuration headed by two great blocs: the United States and the Soviet Union. Despite the climate of hope in the division of defeated Germany, a series of suspicions begin to emerge among the old allies. The Russians with control of so-called Eastern Europe awoke among Western allies suspected of a possible breakthrough in 1946.&#10;&#10;The Americans, along with the British, began to reposition the bulk of their troops on German frontiers and started a program to ship supplies and ammunition to their units. In 1947 the Russians also began to move in this chess, with the increase of their military personnel in occupied Germany. In 1948 the first case occurred when Stalin&rsquo;s armies block Berlin, barring access to supplies and new troops. The American response comes in two nuclear attacks, one on Moscow with a new American bomb called BlueToddler and another attack on the Soviet heavy industries in the Urals with three small tactical weapons known as Nuke Candy. The Russians advance their conventional forces on the allies, and a new conflict begins. The allies are now mortal enemies, on the one hand, the Americans, the English, and the French, and on the other hand the Russians and the Chinese, who proclaim themselves communists in 1947, joining the so-called Soviet Federation.&#10;&#10;In 1949 is invented by the Russians the engines of macro combustion enabling the introduction of so-called combat mechs. These armaments recover the ground lost by the Soviets, pushing the allies to the borders of Poland. In 1950 the first Russian nuclear bomb exploded over New York, taking the world war to the American soil! In 1951 the Allies entered with their mechs of combat in Europe, bringing the conflict to unimaginable levels.&#10;&#10;In this scenario, a powerful organization arises, formed by old Nazis who dream of having a great Germany again: the Werwolf Korp. Hidden in the Bavarian Alps in dark Nazi fortresses, they emerge as a fighting force with fantastic weapons and black magic. These represent one more weight in the pendulum of history.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hot War is a wargame of miniatures past in an alternate world where the 2nd. World war becomes a third due to the postwar cold war climate.&#10;We add fantastic elements like mechs, Nazi black magic, among other things, in a simple game system focused on skirmish (few minis) for quick matches and that allow the player to have fun in full.

Recommended playing sizes are boards with 5 to 8 cells per side.&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing stones on a hexhex board, until the board is full or until all players pass consecutively. Groups of like-colored stones are &quot;chunks&quot; if they contain two or more stones; single stones are merely &quot;crumbs.&quot; The winner is the player with the fewest CHUNKS in his/her color of stones at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;In the case of a tie in the number of chunks, the tied player with the &quot;fewest smallest groups&quot; wins. That is, tied players compare their number of CRUMBS; the player with the fewest crumbs wins.  If the number of crumbs is also tied, then players compare their number of groups consisting of exactly two stones; the player with the fewest size-2 groups wins. If the players have the same number of size-2 groups, then they compare size-3 groups; the player with the fewest size-3 group wins -- and if need be, players keep comparing groups on up through the various sizes (size-4, size-5, ...) until the tie is broken.  (In the two player game, an &quot;all the way up&quot; tie is mathematically impossible so long as the players did not prematurely pass; eventually the tie will necessarily be broken as players compare larger and larger groups. In the multi-player game, an &quot;all the way up&quot; tie is theoretically possible but non-existent in practice.)&#10;&#10;On his/her turn, a player is allotted a number of stones equal to his/her current number of chunks. (The initial board configuration begins -- Othello-like -- with each player having one chunk already on the board.  See the  &quot;Starting Configuration&quot; posting in the rules forum for details.) A player may play any number of stones from 0 (a pass) up to his/her allotted number.  A player may play any color of stone (even an opponent's color); multiple stones can be any color or color mix.&#10;&#10;In the two player game, in order to offset the first player advantage, the PIE rule applies:  After Player 1 plays his/her very first stone, Player 2 then decides whether to play a stone to the board or switch colors with Player 1.  (If &quot;switch colors&quot; is chosen, then the player who was formerly Player 1 is now Player 2, and immediately plays a stone as his/her turn #1 move.)&#10;&#10;Honors&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wunchunk won 3rd place in the Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game Contest of 2019&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Example&#10;&#10;&#10;     This forum posting gives an example of a Wunchunk endgame, which shows the above rules in action.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"
