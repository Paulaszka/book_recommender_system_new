Mannerheim&rsquo;s troops employ Molotov cocktails, surprise infiltrations and an optimal exploitation of the terrain to resist the Russian giant until March. But the lack of armament and international support, the limited numbers of troops, and a Soviet surge irreversibly compel the little Nordic outlier to sign an accord on 12 March 1940.&#10;&#10;"

As wealth from crafts and foreign trade elevated northern Italy&rsquo;s urban families above the landed lords, rivalries within and among their cities hardened into conflict between two great parties. The Ghibellines aligned with the Hohenstaufen emperors who ostensibly ruled Italy, while the Guelphs backed rival imperial claimants and the greatest challenger to the Emperor&rsquo;s authority, the Pope. Should any faction gain advantage, others coalesced to resist.&#10;&#10;The comuni (republics) of Firenze (Florence) and Siena dominated inland Tuscany at the head of competing alliances. As Guelphs sealed their control of the more populous Firenze, Ghibelline Siena turned to the Hohenstaufen King Manfredi of Naples for help. Local rebellions and reprisals escalated on each side, as political exiles stirred the pot. After Manfredi dispatched German knights to protect his loyal Tuscans, Firenze mustered its people and allies to march on Siena, which responded with its own great army. Pisa and Lucca, Lombardia and Umbria joined in. Guelph and Ghibelline faced off en masse at Montaperti in September 1260, in what turned out a bloody Florentine defeat. As Ghibelline exiles returned to grip Firenze, its Guelphs rallied to Lucca and Arezzo, portending an eternal inferno of fighting.&#10;&#10;Inferno&mdash;the third volume in Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s Levy &amp; Campaign Series&mdash;visits the conflagration that was 13th-Century Tuscan warfare, factional conflict fueled by the money and burgeoning population of the region&rsquo;s well-to-do cities and mountain valleys. Veteran Italian wargame designer Enrico Acerbi applies his deep knowledge of the age to bring it to life within Volko&rsquo;s accessible medieval-operational system. Gathering enough transport and provender may not so much be the challenge here as the sudden impediment of rebel towns and castles along key roads. Tuscany&rsquo;s unruly berrovieri horsemen, famed elite crossbowmen, and distinctive palvesari shield bearers are just a few of the unique features of this volume. Muster, mount up, and find out whose blood will make the Arbia run red!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;    One 17x22 inch Mounted Map&#10;    175 Wooden pieces&#10;    106 Playing Cards&#10;    Three full-color Countersheets&#10;    15 cardboard Lord and Battle mats&#10;    One Lords sticker sheet&#10;    Four Player Aid sheets&#10;    Two Screens&#10;    Rules Booklet&#10;    Background Booklet&#10;    Six 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;"

One day, the little rat children discovered a comic in the junkyard that described the first landing on the moon, and thus the plan was born: Build a rocket and take over the cheese moon!&#10;&#10;Fortunately, the junkyard has everything the rats need to build their rocket, and the other animals are willing to support this daring venture &mdash; at least if they're well paid. Of course, all the rats work together to achieve this mighty goal. However, each rat family competes to build the most rocket parts and to train the most rattronauts so they can feast on as much of the lunar cheese as possible.&#10;&#10;In First Rat, each player starts with two rats and may raise two more. On your turn, you either move one of your rats 1-5 spaces on the path or move 2-4 of your rats 1-3 spaces each as long as they end up on spaces of the same color. Your rats can never share the same space, and if you land in a space with another player's rat, you must pay them one cheese, borrowing cheese from the back as needed. After movement, you collect resources (cheese, tin cans, apple cores, baking soda, etc.) matching the color of the space you occupy or move your lightbulb along the light string, which will boost your income in future turns. (More lights in the junkyard makes it easier for you to find things!)&#10;&#10;If you end movement near a store, you can spend resources to buy a backpack or bottle top &mdash; or you can steal an item instead, with the rat then returning to the start of the movement track. You can also spend resources to build rocket sections (and score points) or spend cheese in bulk as a donation (and score points).&#10;&#10;When you pick up apple cores, you move around the rat burrow to pick up comics or stored food or raise one of your rats from the nursery. Alternatively, you automatically get a new rat when one of your rats reaches the launch pad and boards the spaceship. When a player places their fourth rat on the spaceship &mdash; or places their eighth scoring marker on the board &mdash; the game ends, and the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, the tied player with the most rattronauts in the rocket wins.&#10;&#10;First Rat includes a solo mode as well as variable game set-ups described in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;"

That is central to the design philosophy of these wargame rules.&#10;&#10;In the case of Stingbad, included are three ways of choosing armies, and the features include amongst other things flexible unit sizes, different types of battle, weather rules, commander ratings, fluke hits, heroes and speeches, collapsing buildings, smoke and - as you'd expect - magic rules. Magic can be powerful, it can cause hills to rise up or collapse, and trees to animate and become walking creatures and water to rage for instance, all assuming you can get the magic to work!&#10;&#10;The rules have taken years to develop, during which keeping them simple and not complicating things was a major challenge. They can be used with as many or as few figures as you want (individually based, that is!).&#10;&#10;We hope you decide to give them a go, and enjoy leading your hordes to ultimate victory, or even to glorious defeat... ?!&#10;&#10;&ndash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each version has a different theme, usually from a manga or an anime series (e.g. Gundam or Spy x Family), a movie franchise (e.g. Godzilla) or things like the Sanrio Characters (Hello Kitty!) or Chiikawa. The rules for each version are the same except for some minor differences and the scoring for sets.&#10;&#10;The setup is like in Mahjong except each player holds 8 tiles instead of Mahjong's 13 tiles. Each turn a player picks up one tile and discards one. The goal is to collect a winning hand, a &quot;yaku&quot; of 3 sets of 3 tiles. Different combinations score differently. The original version of the game was called Ponjan (Punch game), as you could &quot;Pon&quot; like in Mahjong. The same rule applies to the currect versions of the game. The difference to Ponjan is that in Ponjan you try to collect 3 sets of 4, instead of 3 tiles. Additionally, Jarapon published by Epoch has numbered tiles, making sequences possible, depending on the rules used. The game can be player by 2-4 players, is easy enough to teach anyone from 4 years olds to grandmothers but exciting enough for anyoneto have some casual fun.&#10;&#10;The sets come with 83 tiles plus a blank extra tile.

To set up the game, randomly choose 5 cards from each type and shuffle them.&#10;&#10;Everyone will be asked the same question, then writes down their responses at the same time. All players with the winning answer join the Green Team and score points. If your answer is not the most popular among the other players, then you join the Orange Team and score zero points for that round. Players joining the Green Team from the Orange Team will score one point. Players who are on the Green Team and stay on it will earn two points.&#10;&#10;But it's not about having the best answer, or the smartest answer, or the funniest answer. Only the most popular answer wins - the one that the most players at the table wrote down.&#10;&#10;To win, get on the Green Team, stay on the Green Team, and win - because that's what the Green Team does. They win.&#10;&#10;"

The title of the game is a portmanteau of &quot;pattern&quot; and &quot;karuta&quot;.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, a card is flipped from the stack to create the winning conditions for the turn. The conditions include two parts and a Venn diagram. Depending on the Venn diagram, each of the two parts must be included or excluded from a card in order for it to fit the winning conditions.&#10;&#10;The quickest player to find a card with the correct combination of parts wins the turn. If no cards match the conditions, the fastest player to pick up the condition card wins instead.&#10;&#10;When there are no longer any cards left in the stack, the game ends. The player who has collected the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Anything goes! The only rule is that you cannot reveal your cards. You have to let the doubt hang out.&#10;&#10;"

Whoever first fulfills the required number of cards wins.&#10;&#10;The situation on the game board changes with every turn. The active player can choose to either place a blindly-drawn wooden cube on the board or to move an already-placed cube to a different space.&#10;&#10;A ball recessed at the bottom of the game board makes it easy to rotate the board in all directions, and the different perspectives &mdash; from above or from one of the four sides &mdash; allow for multiple possibilities of fulfilling a task card for all players, whether it's their turn or not. If the cubes on the game board lie on different levels or in different rows, the viewing direction is crucial. Cubes hidden from view don't count.&#10;&#10;"
