However, oddly enough, they would not sanction adequate ground, sea and air forces to mount it. The British however, possibly because the capture of the Dodecanese had been one of Churchill's favorite projects ever since war began, plunged in hell or high water, ignoring the fact that boldness does not always equate to success. &#10;Kos, even today, remains a quaint island unchanged in many ways since 1943. Located in the Aegean Sea, four miles from the Turkish coast is 28 miles long and 6 miles wide, at the widest point. It has an area of about 115 square miles, and a population of 20,000 in 1943, an airfield at Marmari, near the coast, another at Antimachia, and an emergency landing ground under construction at Lambia, near the town of Kos. The highest elevation is 2800 feet. Because of the airfields and its small port, Kos was one key, which would unlock the Aegean. If it could be taken, argued the British, Rhodes would fall and with Rhodes in British control, the other islands garrisoned with Italians, would certainly surrender. The other Allies, the Americans, were not interested in the least and refused to even lend a few P-38 squadrons until too late.&#10;&#10;Thus, the British were on their own to pursue what Churchill had wanted: the soft underbelly of Europe.&#10;&#10;OPERATION EISBAR was the German operation, a prelude to Leros, to prevent the British the most important first step: Kos. The game is a unique blend that allows for either player to win. The first step for the Germans is to destroy the three Spitfire squadrons based on Kos. Only when this is accomplished can German forces invade the island or drop their paratroopers. For the British, if they can cause sufficient aircraft losses during the first phase (German air raids), they may persuade them not to invade Kos. Failing this, the British Kos garrison with one battalion must prevent the Germans from either landing or if they land, defeat them on shore. British BB, CV or DD's may suddenly appear causing havoc, yet, become targets for the Luftwaffe. British Beaufighters may also suddenly appear during an air raid or invasion and torpedo the German ships. The Random Events will make each game's outcome totally different. Above all else, the British must fly in their supplies using only eight DC3s during the first phase.&#10;&#10;The game's scale is platoons and company sized units, individual ships, each air counter is four aircraft. Each hex is 800 yards, game turns are 3-4 hours. The game lasts from Sept 17 to Oct 4. While the number of turns appears a lot, in reality, during Phase 1 (from Sept 17-Oct 2) turns move rapidly as only air battles and bombing occurs. Each player plans which map zone to defend and attack and what time!&#10;&#10;The game map is divided into area zones and used to determine which areas of the island will be targeted by the German, defended by the British. They also serve for placement of British Naval and off map based aircraft which may randomly appear! There 280 counters.&#10;&#10;"

It was Syria's Kursk-like battle. Over 100 T-62 and T-55 tanks faced a paltry 20 IDF Centurion tanks, many short of ammunition. It was David vs. Goliath in modern day terms. The only thing the IDF had going for it was the 12 foot deep anti-tank ditch and the three tiered ramp positions for the tanks. The Valley of Tears remains perfect tank country, flat with long range of fire. To add to the confusion, the IDF patch quilt of forces all operated on different radio frequencies making any coordination impossible. For the Syrian, the AT ditch, which stretched out along the front was also littered with mines. Crossing it under fire would prove to be daunting using the mobile bridge laying equipment.

Facing the SS were a collection of Soviet forces well dug in and supplied with artillery on the 1000-2000 ft hills surrounding the valley.

In a historical sense, it was a &quot;Little Stalingrad&quot; as the Russians attempted to retake the small town of 5000 people at the foothills of the Black Mountains. Over 2000 Russians and 800 Chechens would lose their lives there. The urban setting littered with many brick and stone buildings with deep basements made for a bloody fight. On March 5th, the Chechen forces seized the town from the Russians and held on until the 15th. Every building would be a war. The Russians pounded the town with artillery, air and Mi-24 gunships creating simply more and more rubble. More Chechens arrived and by the 9th, some 1500 were in the town. Each basement had become a bunker. Russian elite troops were sent in, including Russia's recent new air-fuel weapon, the dreaded Buratino and Schmel. T-72's were sent in firing at point blank range towards the buildings. It was a messy battle and both sides were determined to win and the Russians had just been obliterated near Ulus-Kert on Hill 776 losing its whole 6th Paratroop company!&#10;&#10;Depicts what many call the most devastating battle after Grozny. Situated at the base of the Black Mountains, this small town of 5000 became for focal point of two desperate military machines. In early March, a weak Russian security force assumed control of the town. The Chechen forces were very close by and desperate. The Russian war machine had been ripping them apart. Taking advantage of the situation, the 500 man force attacked the town and wiped out the Russians. Beginning on the 6th, the Russian military made six attempts to seize the town, all failed. Artillery, airstrikes, T-72 tanks and Buratino's were called in. It was a sledgehammer. The Chechen force withstood this using underground pillboxes in the stone buildings, and by the 12th, the town was in ruin and the Russians still remained along the perimeter. The Chechen force somehow had received reinforcements and now swelled to 1500 hardened armed fighters. They had laid mines.
