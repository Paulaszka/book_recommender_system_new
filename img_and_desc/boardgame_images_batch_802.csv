This lets even the weak cards in your starting deck become more powerful as the game progresses. If you reach a total of thirty mastery, you can activate your Infinity Shard, which instantly defeats your opponent.&#10;&#10;As you acquire new cards, you can employ allies and champions to craft your strategy. Mercenary cards can be added to your deck as in other deck-building games or they can be played immediately from the center row for their ability; this adds even more drama to each player's turn as a key mercenary flip can alter the very outcome of the game!&#10;&#10;"

The matching edges must both have the same railroad on them. Each newly laid city gets one or more randomly drawn colored cubes placed on it that represent the goods that can be delivered from that city. After all players have laid their city tile, you deliver one goods cube using one of that city's railroad links. This gives you points and raises the value of that railroad stock.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, your score is the total of all of the points that you received from deliveries, from other players using your railroad links, and from the value of all of your railroad stock tiles.&#10;&#10;"

Kicking Class brings an enticingly comical twist to high school. Players take on the role of students going through a whirlwind of hilariously relatable high school faux pas. In the game, you will race against your fellow students to come out on top and claim a full-ride scholarship to the university of your dreams.&#10;&#10;Unlike your typical scholarships, which judge you based on boring things like your GPA or school contributions, the K.A. scholarship has developed its own unique ranking system. To claim this scholarship, you will need to pass classes, spread rumors, throw parties, and do whatever it takes to get the upper hand over your fellow students.&#10;&#10;Whether you strive for popularity or bury your face behind textbooks, the options are endless. Now get ready to kick some class!&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW&#10;&#10;The game takes place over the 4 years of high school. Each year there are 3 trimesters, in which you will be taking classes. To pass a class, you will roll skill dice and see if you meet the requirements. If you pass, you keep the card and gain the reward. If you fail, you must draw from the dreaded failure deck!&#10;&#10;You will earn scholarship points (SP) for passing classes, being popular, and taking the ACT. At the end of the game, whoever has the most scholarship points wins!&#10;&#10;"

Players begin by each building a &ldquo;base word&rdquo; that uses all three colors (pink, yellow, and blue). In each following round, after any one player rolls the dice for a &ldquo;color combo,&rdquo; every player connects one new word to their own crossword, matching the color combo rolled. Match the color combo by using any combination of both colors rolled &mdash; and only those colors &mdash; to form your entire new word. The game continues in rounds until the first player to use all their letters in their crossword (and then quickly grab both dice) is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are two different ways to play: &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; and &ldquo;Express.&rdquo; Standard has a relaxed pace of play, while Express is a fast-paced word race.&#10;&#10;"
