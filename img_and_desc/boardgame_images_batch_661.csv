Players collect neighbors that are coming to the BBQ and place them in a line to form the most awesome picture. &#10;Every round players choose a neighbor, the player that chooses the quickest goes first and:  &#10;-places his neighbor in a picture.&#10;-uses that neighbors ability.&#10;-selects a new neighbor to take into their hand.&#10;When any player has 10 or more neighbors in his picture the game ends. The player who has the most awesome looking picture (points) wins.&#10;&#10;The different cards are what makes this game interesting. Some neighbors look better than others, meaning they are worth more look-at-my-awesome-life (lamal) points. Other neighbors are faster or have better abilities. For instance, some let you take neighbors from another players hand or let you switch around neighbors who are waiting to have their picture taken. &#10;This is useful as many neighbors only look good in the right spot.  That hillbilly standing next to the BBQ with a jerrycan could make for an awesome picture, but not when a policeman or concerned mother is standing next to him...&#10;&#10;Other playmodes introduce the option for fast neighbors to pick up stuff(cards), which can help your strategy in different ways and 'you'(cards), which reward you for having neighbors of a certain color.

The first player secretly looks at the target troll (the top troll card) and plays one of his number tokens face up. If he or she plays a &quot;3&quot; token, it means that the player intends to steal 3 jewels from the target troll. Next players have two options: 1) look at the troll card just as the first player did and play a number token face up; or 2) play a number token face down, take a multiplier (x2) token from the pool, and put the multiplier token on his or her face down number token.&#10;&#10;After all the players played their number tokens, the troll card is revealed.

These small chipboard squares are essentially movable spaces that can be placed anywhere on the board.

The first player to place all of them on the board is the winner.&#10;&#10;The world is made up of tiles of different kinds - foundations for settlements, resources necessary for settlements, and useless wastelands. At the start, the world is terra incognita and all tiles are turned face down, waiting to be explored by the units.&#10;&#10;The units in the world are of two kinds - explorers and barbarians. They do not belong to particular players but any player may act with them.

Barbarians on the other hand plunder tiles and turn them face down again.&#10;&#10;By turning tiles face up or face down, players may make more or less resources connected to settlements. This allows the settlement to be expanded or expelled and the player to replace the existing settlement with one from the hand.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game is to play the common units so that the right settlement can be played in the right place at the right time.&#10;&#10;There are no such things as &rdquo;mine&rdquo; and &rdquo;yours&rdquo;, nor such things as &rdquo;good&rdquo; and &rdquo;evil&rdquo;.

On this game board all coordinates are in units and chess pieces (zees) are used as game pieces. The first number in each coordinate is how far from the game board Origin (0000) in the X direction (right/left), the 2nd number is how far from 0000 in the Y direction (diagonally upward); the 3rd is how far in the Z direction (up/down); the 4th how far in the T direction (diagonally downward). Point 4204, for example, is 4 units in the X direction, 2 units in the Y direction, 0 units in the Z direction, and 4 units in the T direction (from 0000).

JetEyes are caps placed onto the zees to indicate an increased status including moving forward and backwards rather than just forwards around the 4D grid board. A jetEyed Pawn is a King.&#10;&#10;Games can take between 15 minutes and 3 hours depending on the game, number of players, and their experience levels. There are many ways to modify the games so that it takes more or less time, or to accommodate different experience levels. Note: the game has an abstract feel to it that appeals more to the math-geek. The beauty in the board is that it helps you visualize four dimensional space-time. Think of the grid as a 3D cube on a time-line, with 3D cubes at T=0, T=2 (red cube), and T=4. There are also 3D cubes where Y=0, Y=2 (green cube) and Y=4, Z=0, Z=2 (blue cube) and Z=4, and X=0, X=2 (brown, light blue, or yellow cube on website and poster sized boards), and X=4. In fact, because there are midpoints on each of the cubes, there are also 96 smaller 3D cubes on this board.
