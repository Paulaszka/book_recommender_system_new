Make a bet with the others, use your unique powers and gather the most believers in the Archipelago of the Navel of the World.

Even better if you can get the domination - the winning is close. But be careful! To make the bet more interesting other gods would use every sneaky trick.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into 4 rounds. Each player picks a god with unique power, for example ability to send a gigantic monster into the map. Besides that everyone has 5 prophets in a form of wooden discs and a few temples of their own color.&#10;Every round splits into 3 simple phases.&#10;&#10;     Council Phase - players draw two cards with unique rule modifications and vote for the one they want to apply into the game. Once the voting is over, new rule comes into play.&#10;     Mission Phase - every player in their own turn flicks one of their prophets into the map. Prophet may knock other prophets off the map or help them to catch an island. Gods can also use their special powers. This phase ends if there is no prophet left in any god's pool.&#10;     Conversion Phase - each god gains victory points for every island they have a prophet or temple on. God gains bonus victory points if they dominate the entire island.&#10;&#10;&#10;Moreover there is the Navel of the World Island.

Now you have entirely new generation of prophets to flick into the archipelago.&#10;&#10;After 4 rounds bonus points are dealt out and the winner is the god with most victory points gathered so far. &#10;Numbers included in the section above may vary depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players start with the same capital regardless of the number of players. The game adds extra trains and more private companies based on the number of players (similar to 1846). Train availability, tile&#10;availability, and game end work on a fixed schedule, similar to 18CZ except the round also determines train/tile as well as when stock/operating rounds/end game occur.&#10;&#10;For the first 3 rounds there is one city available per player to start a company in. It works a lot like the minor companies in 1822 where you can see that cities 4, 8, 12 are available in the first round (for a 3 player game), 1, 11, 20 are available in round 2, and 9, 14, 18 are available in round 3. The starting locations are auctioned by highest bid with the bid being discarded to the bank and then the player chooses the starting share price after winning the bid. Players can only start one company each in each of the first 3 rounds, so once you win a bid for a starting location you cannot compete in the other auctions this round. Thus the last player gets the final starting location for $0 without an auction. After the first 3 stock rounds, new companies can be started in any city with an open station circle (after winning the auction for the starting location) and players can start more than one company in a given stock round.&#10;&#10;There is also one randomly picked private company available per player for the first 3 rounds. The private companies are auctioned and count as capital toward starting a company like in 1817. Unlike the starting city locations, players can win more than one bid for the private companies. Some of the private companies produce revenue each round (unlike 1817) so it sometimes make sense to hold a private company for a few rounds before using it to start a company.&#10;&#10;The game has multiple train types each in limited supply. You can buy hex trains (which are good for running to multiple cities right by each other), freight trains (which pick up coal and can run to the off map areas), passenger trains (+10 revenue into the company per city), plus trains (get to run one extra time before rusting), or advanced trains (run the turn they are purchased). The price of the older trains drop each round (you can buy a 2 freight train for $120 in the first operating round, $90 in round 2, or $60 in round 3).&#10;&#10;You have the 2/5/10 share system similar to 1817, including mergers. Companies can take loans similar to 1817 except the loan market is not shared, instead the loan interest rate is driven based on which operating round it is. You have the option when doing 5 share mergers to add share values together instead of averaging as in 1817 (receiving 3 shares instead of 6) to recapitalize a company.&#10;&#10;President shares can be sold to the market and companies then liquidate at the end of the stock round if no other player buys the president share. Trains can only be purchased between companies for full price for a current phase train of 1/2 price for a non current train. The shorting features from 1817 were not included in 1888 for obvious reasons as well as to simply the game.&#10;&#10;The game takes in the 4 to 5 hour range and is intended to be a fun &amp; easy game to play. The goal is simply to maximize your net worth at the end by running trains for as much as possible, driving up their share price, and then dumping the companies right before their trains rust. Players can't go bankrupt because they can just dump companies in bad financial health and companies which cannot buy a train will just die (no presidential liability).&#10;&#10;"

Our clan will prove ourselves to be indispensable to the new Shogun. We will work from the shadows to acquire information about our rival clans. We will kidnap those who might oppose our ascent and assassinate those who prove a threat. We will use cunning to prevent our adversaries from doing the same to us. We will find glory and honor in the eyes of this new Shogun &ndash; or failing that we will end his rule by any means necessary.&#10;&#10;In the strategy game Yedo, players assume the roles of Clan Elders in the city of Edo during the early years of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The object of the game is to amass Prestige Points, mainly by completing missions. To do so, players must gather the necessary assets and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; outfox their opponents and prevent them from completing their missions.&#10;&#10;There are several ways to reach your goal. Will you try to complete as many missions as possible and hope that your efforts catch the Shogun's eye? Or will you choose a more subtle way of gaining power by trying to influence the Shogun during a private audience? You can also put your rivals to shame by buying lots of luxury goods from the European merchants.

When the humans first arrived, they thought they found an unspoiled paradise, filled with bountiful forests, lakes swimming with fish and cold freshwater flowing from the mountains. But as their settlements expanded and the surrounding forests grew thinner, nature itself pushed back. Great creatures known as Beasts emerged, and with their fangs, claws and mystical powers, they proved an incredible threat to the humans. In order to protect the settlements, humans enlisted specialised hunters, tasked with tracking and killing the Beasts before too many of their kin perish.&#10;&#10;The Beast uses a deck of direction cards to move over forests, swamps and caverns, using guile and deceit to hide its track from the hunters. However, whenever a hunter moves over a location where the Beast has previously been, a trail appears. Only when a hunter searches a location or the Beast itself attacks an unsuspecting target is the Beast's actual position revealed. More so, each hunter has but one chance of searching each round, making it a tense and difficult decision. Hunters seldom have full information whether the trail they&rsquo;re pursuing contains the Beast&rsquo;s actual location, or if the trail has already gone cold.&#10;&#10;Each action you perform in this game is done by playing a card from your hand (up to a maximum of two cards per turn). This means that if a player wants to search, attack or move, they need to have a card in their hand that lets them do that. Before each round, both hunters and Beast participate in a draft for the most important cards. All action cards can be used by both Beast and hunters alike.&#10;&#10;In order to win this game, you either need to cooperate every step of the way if you play as a hunter, or skillfully outmaneuver your opponents if you play as Beast. On their own, hunters are never stronger than the Beast. Only when hunters communicate, strategize and combine their actions can they bring down the Beast before it&rsquo;s too late.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
