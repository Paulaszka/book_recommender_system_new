About a quarter of these people are at Stage 3 of the infection, and the numbers of the &quot;Afflicted&quot; are growing by the day. Cities throughout the U.S. Midwest are emptying as healthier citizens flee for the coasts and roving gangs terrorize the highways. Rumors abound as to the cause &mdash; a madman with a chip on his shoulder, a military experiment gone wrong, and so on &mdash; but if there's any hope for turning back the tide on this illness, someone will need to find a cure. And the best bet for this cure is a small team of survivors unaffected by the virus, searching from city to city as they find and stop the Mastermind behind the Z-B13 virus.&#10;&#10;The pulp-adventure cooperative game Zero Hour balances dice placement with a press-your-luck threat track and risk/reward decisions that add tension on every turn. Combined with an optimistic take on a well-loved gaming theme, Zero Hour flips the zombie genre into an epic quest to find the cure for the Z-B13 virus...all in about an hour.&#10;&#10;"

Each character will use different abilities to solve mysteries in each scenario or island (by means of modular boards) to fulfill secondary missions; they will roll dice and play cards in order to move, fight enemies or sail depending of how many PP they still have left. All in a cooperative way to escape alive from all this because dead men tell no tales...&#10;&#10;"

Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided.&#10;&#10;Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first wins the game!&#10;&#10;Lead one of these nations to victory&mdash;but watch out for your enemies as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.&#10;&#10;Antike II differs from the 2005 Antike in several ways, according to designer Mac Gerdts. To start, players now own city tokens, which allows them some degree of choice as to which resource a newly founded city shall produce. Military units have become more expensive, and the rules for the conquest of cities are considerably easier. The scientific progresses were altered as well. Neutral temples now exist, which may be destroyed, gaining VPs of a general, without harming other players. The game features two new maps in a new graphical design, and a new card named &quot;BELLONA&quot; (the ancient Roman goddess of war) has been introduced to counter the starting player's advantage.&#10;&#10;Gerdts notes that the main goal of all of these changes was to make the rules for a conquest of cities easier, while also opening more possibilities to win the game without the need to attack other players.&#10;&#10;"

Features include easy to learn rules, small armies of just a few dozen 15mm figures (about 10-12 elements/stands) and a few vehicles, and a flexible force creation system. Create a completely custom force representing anything from a former regular rifle company (and now your personal war band!) to a hardened civilian militia from your hometown. The game uses only standard 6-sided dice and can be played on the average dining room or kitchen table.&#10;&#10;The game is available in electronic and hard copy formats.  Players can use 'extra' 15mm figures they may have lying around or simply reuse miniatures they have for other games to create post apocalyptic warbands with minimal cash outlay.

There were dozens of entries and the judges whittled them down over three rounds to find the game that best leveraged the dice in a fun new way. That winner was 9-Shooter Quick Draw by Ryan Strong.&#10;&#10;As you might expect with a game about a gunfight in the dusty streets of an old west town, the rules for 9-Shooter Quick Draw (9SQD) are dead-simple.&#10;&#10;Each player gets 3 gunslingers, 3 action cards, and 1 set of Square Shooters&reg; dice.&#10;&#10;Both players reveal a gunslinger and face it so their opponent can see the poker hand printed on the card.&#10;&#10;Both players pick up their dice and shake them in their fists until one player shouts &quot;DRAW!&quot; They both roll their dice and the gunfight begins.&#10;&#10;You're trying to roll the poker hand on your opponent's gunslinger card and you can lock in any of your matching dice at any time, but after that first big roll, you can only re-roll unlocked dice that have...&#10;&#10;The same number (Aces, 4's, Kings, etc...)&#10;&#10;The same suit (Hearts, Clubs, etc...)&#10;&#10;If you have no matching dice, you can only re-roll a single die of your choice.&#10;&#10;If your opponent catches you rolling mismatched dice, you have to stop, give him a hard look, and re-roll a single random die to re-set.&#10;&#10;BTW, Jokers are wild so they can be any number and suit you like.&#10;&#10;That's it. You both keep rolling as fast as you can until one of you locks in all of the dice to match the other's gunslinger card. That player shouts &quot;BANG!&quot; and your gunslinger is dead!

You flip out the card and call out the name, then your opponent has to stop everything and do what the card says. That might mean waiting for you to get in some extra rollin', or maybe having to unlock one die.  Ouch!&#10;&#10;Some of the cards are there to help you, too, like letting you re-roll mismatched dice or canceling the card your opponent just played on you.&#10;&#10;They don't call it the Wild West for nuthin'!&#10;&#10;"

Players are attempting to destroy the nasty creatures below in the dungeon to gain fame by playing cards face down and revealing simultaneously. Each enemy has a set number of hit points based on the number of players. There are three enemies to deal with in each level of the dungeon, so strategy, tactics, and bluffing are a must. There is also two rounds of bidding so players gain insight into what other players are up to.&#10;&#10;2)Deck Building. When a player defeats an enemy, that card is rotated 180 degrees and then added to the player's discard pile. The bottom of each monster card indicates what item the enemy is carrying. These items add power to your character in future rounds, and act as an organic and thematic way to show that your characters are advancing.&#10;&#10;3)Draft Your Unique Party. Before play begins, players complete a draft in order to create their starting hand of twelve cards. Each player gets one Hero and one Henchman.

In the more densely populated areas colonies are connected by wormhole networks whilst vast fleets span the trackless expanses of the void. Contact has been made with a number of alien races around the periphery of human space but for the most part this has been peaceful and limited to scientific missions and the exchange of ambassadors. As a generalisation humanity is content, inward looking and exploited - by you, the players of the game.&#10;&#10;This game is played on a board composed of 7 hexagonal tiles, comprising 6 regional powers and a central neutral zone that may have different configurations depending on the episode of galactic 'history' the players choose to replay. Additional part-tiles are arranged around the edge of the board to make the playing area into a regular hexagon. These part-tiles are of 2 different types and can have a significant effect on the topology of the game board.&#10;&#10;In Imperial-Orion the players do not take turns, the six regional powers do, in an order that is determined randomly at the start of each game. The players are shadowy organisations who exercise power through unspecified means to further their own ends. By gaining control of the population of the regional powers,&#10;the players influence the politics. The player with more control over a region's population gains control of that power's government and decides what the it will do. As control of a government can change with each new surge of controlled population, players may be able to manipulate several governments at the same time. As investors, players should not get too attached to a particular regional power, but rather focus on where their 'investments' have the best rates of return. Essentially the game is about power, in all its form: economic, cultural, military, biological&hellip;&#10;&#10;"

These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.&#10;&#10;But the time of peace was short-lived. A prophecy arose that if one Phoenixborn was able to absorb enough Ashes of others, they would ascend into full gods and take mastery over this world. This, as well as humans' greed for land, fueled the War of Ashes. The great cities now fight among each other, each one of them with a Phoenixborn at its helm, and you will decide who will rise and who will fall to ashes.&#10;&#10;Ashes Reborn: Rise of the Phoenixborn, released in 2021, features the same Phoenixborn as in the original Ashes with the same cards, but some cards have been modified to balance them. (Publisher Plaid Hat Games estimates that about 30% of all cards across all expansions are being modified.) The rules have undergone a few changes as well, mostly to clarify powers. The Ashes Reborn 1.5 Upgrade Kit contains more than 350+ updated Ashes cards, along with an updated rulebook, allowing players to move from the original game to the new 1.5 rules.&#10;&#10;"
