Each turn, players attempt to find and then photograph the most prestigious animals by following these 3 stages:&#10;&#10;Stage 1: Research&#10;&#10;So, you thought you could just rock up with your camera and take a photo, eh? Well, first you need to do your homework!&#10;Turn over new animal cards to increase your options and gain tracking tokens to boost your rolls... but be careful - if you draw too many cards, the animals will get spooked, ending your turn.&#10;&#10;To avoid spooking animals, you can reserve animal cards and roll for them later. However, you have a hand limit of two reserved cards at a time so be careful not to clog up your hand with animals you don't want.&#10;&#10;Other players can also reserve animals on your turn so they will be keeping their eyes peeled for the animals they need!&#10;&#10;Stage 2: Prepare&#10;&#10;Now that you know which animals are available this turn, you must choose your destinations and subjects, represented by placing dice on the animals you plan to photograph and their habitats. The rarer the animals, and the more difficult its habitat, the higher the prestige for photographing it.&#10;&#10;You can photograph as many animals in as many habitats as you have dice for... Be careful, though &ndash; go for too many difficult animals and you could end up with none, so allocate your dice wisely. You only have six dice to roll so you&rsquo;ll need to decide how best to allocate them; do you go cautious and allocate them all to one animal or spread them out and roll for more? You&rsquo;re in control of the odds so, do you feel lucky?&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t forget that you also need to use dice to explore the habitat. You only need to roll for each habitat once, so going for more than one animal in the same location can be a great tactic.&#10;&#10;You can also spend tracking tokens to increase your chances: do you use them now or save them for that crucial roll later on?&#10;&#10;Stage 3: Photograph&#10;&#10;At last! It's time to get out into nature, click the shutter and hope for the best...&#10;First, roll the dice on each habitat to explore it. (Tokens can be used to re-roll habitat dice.) If you fail, your chosen animals are spooked and run away!&#10;&#10;Then, if you explored the habitat successfully, you may roll to photograph your chosen animals!&#10;&#10;If you manage to photograph 3 animals from the same habitat, or one from each habitat, you can collect the corresponding photography award. The earlier you get them, the more they are worth!&#10;&#10;If you failed to get any photographs, don't worry - you learn from the experience and gain 3 tracking tokens to improve your chances next turn&hellip;&#10;&#10;Game End&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player has taken a set amount of photographs and everyone then gets to tally up their score.&#10;&#10;Each player also has a secret Assignment card which bestows bonus prestige for photographing specific animals and characteristics.&#10;&#10;Simply total the prestige on all your animal photographs, Photography Awards and Assignment card to see who becomes Photographer of the Year!&#10;&#10;Snapshot is fun, fast and simple to learn and is well-suited for families while also offering enough depth and tactical opportunities to keep advanced players engaged.&#10;&#10;"

The kitchen also has a pantry with a limited space and can only store so many ingredients. Players are forced to choose between using their stations to start cooking, and therefore, revealing the dishes they want to cook or store them in the pantry for future use. However, the empty space in the pantry will determine how many ingredients you can take in the next round.

They can be Easy, Medium or Hard to cook, and also lets you know the course of the dish. The recipes for the Feast create a race to the finish line and determines who ends the game first. But the Chef's Corner will provide you with those extra recipes that will let you get ahead of the competition and win it.&#10;&#10;Not that fast! Winning doesn't come easy and the multitude of strategies come from the Chef's Bonus. Stations, Satchels, Hand Limit and Pantry all give you an extra edge throughout out the game.

Using these the player will Cook dishes which will earn them victory points or bonuses. Victory points may also be earned from making combos of dishes or making the most number of dishes.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player cooks all the feast recipes and announces Last Call.

It&rsquo;s up to players how to use up stored energy as it can be used as additional buffer to keep action cards or to use so-called &lsquo;overtake button' to increase the chances of successful attack/defensive maneuver or just to extend car movement. Each team has different ERS/OT combinations, gear ratios and special team ability simulating different car characteristics.&#10;&#10;Basically players needs to play the action cards in a way to keep the balance between the speed, tyre wear and risk level to move the car on the board and stop at the fastest places on the track keeping up the momentum. That sounds simple but taking into account tyre degradation, tyre compound differences, ERS management, different car characteristics, battling opponents for position and random racing incidents it gives a real challenge to keep the pace and win the race &hellip; but if you will take right decisions, you will race smart with a bit of a luck you will become a FormulaGP world champion!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
