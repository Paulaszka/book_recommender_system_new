It aims at simulating as closely as possible while remaining a rather simple (yet big) boardgame the various power shifts that we saw in 2019. (A playtest held a few days before the 2019 general elections saw the Tories win an absolute majority and getting rid of their coalition with the DUP... just sayin')&#10;&#10;This is a political game focused on player interactions with half the game revolving around card play inspired by the Sun Tzu boardgame and the other half centered on players negotiating between them how they will vote on the Draft Bills proposed to the floor. It is a long and difficult game that requires a minimum of role playing as players take on specific parties' leadership with specific objectives. It is an asymetrical game where each player has a specific way of winning in order to show the various strategies deployed during 2019 by the real life parties.&#10;The first one is the campaign map. Players compete each turn to gain popularity in 21 constituencies by playing cards and comparing their values. (Similar to the Sun Tzu game's mechanic.) Having more popularity than others gives players a chance to increase their number of Members of Parliament once an election is held. But only the Prime Minister can call for an election, with a little push from the opposition if needed...&#10;&#10;The second battleground is parliament. Players propose Draft Bills to vote into the Brexit Deal. Those bills are policies that tackle Brexit-specific issues. Depending on how the issue is tackled and who proposed the bill, the Brexit Deal gets filled up with policies that grant Victory Points to players, or removes some. For that phase, players vote with all the might of their MPs in Parliament. This is why having an election at the right time can completely change the balance of power in the Westminster House of Commons, and change the face of Brexit as a whole !&#10;&#10;The final competition takes place around those two phases as players get to play Spin Cards, showing how their political teams spin events and control the political landscape.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Instead of marching peacefully to the forest the koalas are now starting to gather in the city and riot!&#10;&#10;Bad Koalas is fully-cooperative, which means players win or lose as a team. Only one player takes a turn at a time, but they may solicit feedback from other players.&#10;&#10;&bull; The deck contains of 4 different colors (types) of koalas.&#10;&bull; The play area is communal for all players. It consists of four columns, one for each koala type. The horizontal row of 4 zones at the bottom of each column is collectively called the City; each koala that enters play from the deck is placed into the city zone that corresponds to that koala&rsquo;s color.&#10;&bull; Koalas are unhappy in the city; when too many of them end a turn in the same city zone, they riot, which leads to problems for the players.&#10;&bull; The center row above the City is called the Country. Koalas in the country are relatively happy and therefore don&rsquo;t riot like the koalas in the city.&#10;&bull; The row of zones at the top of each column is called the forest; players want to advance koalas to the forest to score them (flip them over) and gain upgraded action powers that the happy koalas in the forest grant you.&#10;&bull; Above the play area are the 4 action cards that each player can choose from on their turn. Each action is dedicated to moving koalas up toward the forest zones. (The koala token must be moved to a different action card each turn; you can&rsquo;t select the same action that was chosen the previous turn.)&#10;&bull; On their turn, the active player moves the koala token to the action card of their choice, resolves that action, and then places into the city zones the (2+) new koalas that automatically come out of the deck... and resolves any riots that ensue as a result. Then the next player in clockwise turn order takes their turn. The game ends immediately when players win or lose together.&#10;&#10;All players win immediately if at any time all koalas have been cleared from the city and country zones.&#10;&#10;All players lose if either of the following conditions are met:&#10;&bull; if there are 15 or more koalas in the city zones&#10;&bull; if the koala deck is empty when a card is required to be drawn&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
