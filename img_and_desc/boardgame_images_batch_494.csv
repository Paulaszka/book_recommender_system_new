The players must guide four Squires on their journey around the board on their quest to become Knights and garner influence for their household.  During their journey, they will also be attempting to keep the rival households in check.  Can you be the most influential Lord and gain the ear of the King?  Only time will tell.&#10;&#10;Inspired by classic games such as Parcheesi/Ludo and Checkers/Draughts, Accolade is an abstract game of chance and strategy, which has players maneuver their Squires around the exterior path of the board in an attempt to reach their home cathedral (similar to Parcheesi).  Once the Squire makes it to the cathedral, he receives his Accolade and is knighted.  This new Knight now reenters the board, now with the sole goal of interfering with your opponent's Squires and Knights.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of a central hub and 4 spokes, which are assembled differently depending on the number of players (2-4), allowing for a scalable game that decreases the amount of dead time experienced in a 2 player game of Parcheesi/Ludo.  Though the board could also be used as an alternate Parcheesi board using those standard rules (and there is a bonus draughts board on the back of the main hub as well).&#10;&#10;The main mechanic of the game is simple dice rolling for movement in a similar style to Parcheesi, but the pieces have more options on what they can do with those rolls.  Opposing pawns (Squires/Knights) interact with each other by Checking (landing on them, as in Parcheesi) or Capturing (jumping over, as in Checkers) them.  Pawns can attain a degree of safety by being in Castle spaces, or forming a Castle by doubling up 2 pawns of the same color.&#10;&#10;Points (influence) are scored for removing opposing Squire / Knights and for any of your own Knights on the board (not in your home area).&#10;&#10;The game ends once all remaining pawns are Knights, then the player with the most points (influence) gains the ear of the King and is considered the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was created as an entry for TGC Classic Game Mashup Contest.&#10;&#10;"

Players place cards in ascending order from lowest to highest. If a gangster was played with a city card, it's placed in that city in the proper numerical spot; if it was played with a special card, it can be placed in any city, with the special card being placed in the same city before or after the gangster. If the card you placed is one of two gangsters surrounding at least two gangsters of the other color, then you capture the surrounded gangsters and remove them from play. Special cards let you play on the end of a row, switch a gangster from even to odd (or vice versa), or move a gangster from one row to another.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, players discard their special card (if it hasn't been played), then receive a new hand of four gangsters and a special card. Any rows with fewer than five cards are filled to five cards.

The players are &quot;Radiatov&quot;, a race of aliens who want to collect artwork from particular games.&#10;&#10;To start the game, each player receives ten cards (with some cards removed for fewer than six players and a smaller hand size for 7-8 players) as well as a secret goal card. Cards come in five suits valued from 2 to A. The top card of the remaining deck is revealed to show a trump suit, and three of the 30 characters are laid face-up.&#10;&#10;The trick-taking in Dieci is fairly standard: One player leads a card, with everyone else following suit if possible and throwing off (or playing trump) if not possible. The highest trump card claims all cards in the trick; if no trump was played, then the highest card regardless of suit wins the trick. The player claiming the trick must then claim one face-up character card bearing a suit played in that trick; if no such character is face-up, the player claims the top character card from the deck. Going clockwise, each player then claims a remaining character card or passes; once everyone has passed or all characters have been claimed, the next trick begins.&#10;&#10;Once the character deck runs out, the game ends. Players score:&#10;&#10;&#10;    One point for each card claimed.&#10;    A variable number of points (0-20) depending on how many characters they took that are shown on their secret goal card.&#10;    Their lowest-valued character card in each of the five suits. For each other character in a suit, they lose points equal to that character's value.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

It combines five completely different minigames into a timeless struggle for cultural supremacy!  Players balance their actions by using population discs in the following ways:&#10;&#10;1. Gather resources by flicking your disc down a platform decreasing in size with increased return for increased risk.&#10;2. Research new technologies by flicking your disc at one of four stacks of available technologies arranged like a breakout game and taking the block you strike.  Once obtained, players need to choose whether or not to add the technology to their list of abilities or to trade in the block to increase their population&#10;3. Declare war on the other player's civilization by flicking your disc at their researched technologies stacked in a pyramid.  Knock your opponent's blocks down to steal population, technology or colonies&#10;4. Vie for colonies by flicking your disc closer to the colony disc than your opponents&#10;5. Construct Wonders of the World by stacking resource cubes on a disc and sliding it along a path symbolizing the shape of the building without letting one fall&#10;&#10;NOTES:&#10;&#10;Construction of 'Flicking Through the Ages' requires:&#10;1 set of Jenga-style blocks&#10;1 set (2 colors) of 'bakelite'-style backgammon discs or other discs of roughly 1.25&quot; diameter that flick reasonably well and are heavy enough to impact a tower of Jenga blocks enough to fall over&#10;1 set of the rules including the 'colony' and 'technology' sticker sets to be applied (or taped) to the above components&#10;&#10;"
