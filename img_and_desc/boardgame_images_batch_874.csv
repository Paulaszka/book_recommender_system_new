If one disaster hit them they may have been prepared, but what happens when all the disasters hit at the same time?&#10;&#10;This Game Is A Disaster is a very uncooperative card game where each of the 2-6 players take an equal part of the deck with each card representing one of their disaster survivors. The players take turns playing cards that recreate familiar scenes from disaster movies - giant tsunamis, impromptu volcanoes, and sometimes sharks! The goal is destroy all opponents' cards and to be the last player with cards left.&#10;&#10;A central part of &quot;Disaster&quot; is the shared discard pile, known as the Destroyed Pile. Players lose cards to this central pile but can play cards to retrieve as well, representing the reunions and other bright spots that appear in disaster movies.&#10;&#10;This Game Is A Disaster is a fast and fun game that is as ridiculous as it is severe.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The first one decides in which directions the loot is drifting: first horizontally then vertically. A small triangle marks the horizontal direction. &#10;The second dice decides how many steps a beach comber can move. Until loot landed on one of the sandbanks, the comber can only move horizontally. As soon as loot has stranded somewhere all combers can move directly into the direction of the loot and collect it by just moving onto the sandbank. If there are moves left, the loot can be picked up and the comber is able to move the rest of the moves back to the beach to save the goods.&#10;A beach comber collects all goods on the sandbank which she/he landed on.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

In this game, 1-4 players represent prominent political factions attempting to gain control over the men who would be Emperors of Rome.  Players deploy the influence available to them (represented by the cards in their hands) to claim imperial reigns (represented by the historical Emperor cards arrayed on the board.)   But they must be very careful, because politics is a complex game, and sometimes attempting to exert your influence necessitates aiding someone else in their own plots.  Play your cards cleverly to capture Emperors and score the most points to win.&#10;&#10;At its heart, The Barracks Emperors is a trick-taking game, but not one like you&rsquo;ve ever seen before. In this innovative design, all 13 tricks are available for play simultaneously, in an interlocking grid that forces you to balance the value of every card you play against the value that same card may have for another player on a different trick.  Plus, every card grants you an additional special ability that you might be able to use to spring a surprise on your unwitting opponents.&#10;&#10;Features:&#10;Historical emperors, co-emperors, pretenders, and even Gallic Emperors who broke away from Rome during the Crisis of the Third Century are all represented as individual cards in the game, each with interesting facts about the rise and demise of the man depicted.&#10;&#10;For fans of Time of Crisis: The Roman Empire in Turmoil, 235-284 AD and Time of Crisis: The Age of Iron and Rust, you will find some of the concepts and flavor from that deck-building wargame, adapted in this all new standalone game.  You don&rsquo;t need Time of Crisis to play The Barracks Emperors, but you&rsquo;ll recognize Influence Cards such as Praetorian Guard, Foederati, and Pretender, now used in an entirely new way.&#10;&#10;An innovative card drafting mechanic adds an extra layer of strategy to how you play your cards while also mitigating the luck that would come with being dealt a full hand of cards at the start of each round.&#10;&#10;This game is designed for 4 players, but also includes options for 2 or 3 players, plus an easy-to-play solitaire adaptation for the solo player.&#10;&#10;"

With the problems, you can stop the other players by devaluating them, fining them, looting them or corralling their money. With the solutions, you can solve the problems that your competitors threw at you (but unfortunately these solutions only work in the game). With the bonds (and this may be strange for everyone) you can take advantage of their value and exchange them with the state for money.&#10;&#10;On your way to the end of the year, you will land on empty lots where you can put your business, listen to the National Chain, collect privilege pensions, pay extraordinary taxes, sell pots and many other things that will make you think that you have always been a great player of this game and that nobody else will be able to win.&#10;&#10;This game references the 1998-2002 Argentine Great Depression.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the translated&#10;&#10;Su objetivo es llegar a fin de a&ntilde;o, claro que esto no es tarea f&aacute;cil.
