These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.&#10;&#10;Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.&#10;&#10;End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.&#10;&#10;"

4113,,"Tigers in the Mist, Ardennes Offensive, The Battle of the Bulge, December 16 - 22, 1944, this game simulates the early stages of the German offensive in the Ardennes section of Western Europe (Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg) in December of 1944. Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Belgium. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River&#10;&#10;The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.&#10;&#10;During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.&#10;&#10;As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive?

Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone&rsquo;s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else&rsquo;s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.&#10;&#10;Arne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.&#10;&#10;There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.&#10;&#10;How ARNE Works!&#10;&#10;Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:&#10;&#10;White cards which you may only play when it is your turn &#10;Black cards which you may play whenever you want to&#10;&#10;In practice, all players can play cards at the same time.

In all essential details the &quot;Hyena Game&quot; seems to have been identical to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (The Game of the Coiled One).  The board's shape suggests it may be a distant ancestor of the Game of Goose but the mechanics are so different that this is probably a coincidence.&#10;&#10;It was played on a spiraling track, employed stick dice (throwing sticks) of precisely the kind known from Archaic Egyptian contexts, and had two types of pieces, one representing a predatory animal.  The only difference would seem to be that the ancient Egyptians allotted six counters to each player rather than only one.  The Cretan Phaistos Disc may have been a Mehen board, but that remains speculation.&#10;&#10;Mehen is the only multi-player ancient Egyptian board game known, the others (Senet, Aseb, Hounds &amp; Jackals, etc.) being all two-player games.  The main function of the serpent-shaped Egyptian god Mehen was to protect the sun-god Ra from his enemies by coiling around him.  In the Old Kingdom, the race-game Mehen took the name and shape of the god: a coiled serpent with the gaming spaces on its back.  As &quot;bodyguard&quot;, Mehen symbolises the sun-god's immediate neighborhood for the deceased.  The deceased walks towards Ra on the back of the serpent-god.&#10;&#10;By the early Middle Kingdom, the &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; used on the snake's back of the Mehen board to separate the playing spaces were thought to &lsquo;kill&rsquo; the snake &mdash;which would have been a very threatening and evil thing.  Mehen&rsquo;s role was essential, for if Ra were not protected from his enemies, he might not rise in the morning, which would result in the cessation of all life.  In Egyptian belief, &lsquo;life&rsquo; applied not only to the living but also to the dead, who were believed to travel with the sun and to rise, reborn, with him at dawn.  From that time forth, the game apparently ceased to be played, possibly banned and forbidden.&#10;&#10;"
