The promise of an unforgettable trip from Gdynia to New York attracted onto the ship's deck the most prominent personas, who wished to take part in the adventure of their lives.  No one suspected that the scenes taken straight from the bestselling crime novels will soon unfold aboard the legendary transatlantic ship. Audacious theft of the countess Pawlicka's priceless jewels has shaken both the passengers and  crew members alike. However the most shocking fact is undeniable truth that the thief is hidden among them...&#10;&#10;MS Batory is a deduction game, which in innovatory way makes use of three-dimensional game board. The players take a role of detectives, and their task will be to identify the thief as quickly as possible. Each character from among thirteen suspects has a set of unique features - gender, age and a role. The players will ask each other questions, based on which they'll be able to determine the innocence of the suspects. At the beginning of the game, one of the cards which represents characters will be randomly selected and put aside - this character is a thief.  The rest of the remaining cards will be distributed among the detectives.&#10;&#10;The player's round consists of the two phases:&#10;&#10;1. Movement Phase&#10;&#10;The players move characters around the deck of MS Batory. They have at their disposal a three-dimensional ship, which consists of  several dozen rooms, located on the three separate decks. During this phase, the Players will move characters and perform different tasks - like for example: &quot;Meet up with the member of the crew&quot; or &quot;Go to the observation deck&quot;. By performing those actions they will gain question cards, which are used later during investigation phase. Characters need to be moved around the ship so that current task is completed as many times as possible. All the while it has to be remembered, that arrangement created by character's placement can hinder or help when it is time for asking questions in investigation phase.&#10;&#10;2. Investigation Phase&#10;&#10;During movement phase, the players had gained question cards. Each of these cards contains one trait - age, gender, role, number, room or deck. Using these cards, the player will formulate a single question, which he will ask to another detective.  This question can be of any kind, but it has to be based upon the question cards at a player's disposal.&#10;&#10;For example, when in possession of  cards: &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;deck&quot; the player can ask another detective &quot;Are there any women among your characters which are currently on the observation deck?&quot; On the other hand, having a more varied set of cards like &quot;age&quot;, &quot;role&quot;, &quot;number&quot; and &quot;room&quot; allows for asking more detailed questions such as: &quot;How many of your middle aged crew members are currently in the cabin?&quot; Skillfully asked question allows the detective to eliminate further characters from his list of suspects, without giving away too many clues to the rest of the players.&#10;&#10;The winner is the detective who first identifies the thief!&#10;&#10;"

In order to deliver the packages, the piglets decided to form their own delivery companies.&#10;&#10;When delivering a package for receipt confirmation they received a hoof print rather than a signature. Each of the piglets' companies compete to see who makes the speediest deliveries.&#10;&#10;In this game, the goal is to move the three pig pieces to the four home bases (other than your own) and collect four hoof print chips before anyone else.&#10;&#10;Each player controls three piglets, starting with all three piglet pieces placed on their home base. There are a total of 5 home bases, one for each player from the center.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players also draw animal tiles and add them to their hand. After drawing a tile, the player carries out all of the following actions, in any order, during their turn: moving a piglet, placing an animal tile, and returning a piglet. Throw away tiles to ensure a player&rsquo;s hand does not exceed three tiles. The game ends when a player successfully moves their piglets to the other four home bases and collects all the hoof prints to win the game.&#10;&#10;Moving a piglet - This action, in combination with the below action (placing an animal tile), can only be carried out a maximum of three times during a single turn (e.g., place one animal tile + move 2 spaces).  A player may move their piglet one space in any direction. The player can also use the secret passage spaces to travel even further. However, except for the home base spaces, a piglet cannot move to a space that is already occupied by another piglet. In addition, if a piglet moves onto a space with an animal tile placed on it, they must obey the law of that tile. If a piglet successfully moves to a home base, they can receive the hoof print from that base.&#10;&#10;Placing an animal tile - This action, in combination with the above action (moving a piglet), can only be carried out a maximum of three times (e.g., place two animal tiles + move 1 spaces). A player places an animal tile from their hand onto an open space. An open space is a space where no animal tiles or piglets are currently placed. However, some tiles can take the place of other tiles and some tiles cannot be placed on some spaces.&#10;&#10;Returning a piglet - This action can be used an unlimited number of times per turn. Move one piglet that is not currently placed on your home base back to your home base. At the same time, you can add a tile (without a piglet piece placed on top) into your hand.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#175;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#187;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#228;&#188;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#160;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#233;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#231;&#164;&#190;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#184;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#232;&#183;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#178;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#141;&#183;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;3&#229;&#140;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#187;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;4&#227;&#129;&#139;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#139;&#160;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#143;4&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#232;&#183;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Storyline - Move the cube on the Time card down one hour and draw the top 3 cards of the Investigate deck. Do not look at their front sides. Choose 1 and place it face up in front of you (this is the current Storyline card); a 2nd card is placed on the discard pile face down; the last card is randomly placed back in the draw deck. Each Investigate card will display a letter designating the type of card - I for Informants, C for Cliffhangers and F for Follow a Lead.&#10;&#10;2. Investigate - Check the time remaining in the game and locate the 3 numbered circles at the bottom left of the Storyline card. On the Storyline card, look at the circle in a row with a number closest to, but greater than, the hour marked currently on the Time card. This is the row of icons you must match by rolling your Investigate dice. You may only use the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Storyline icons, unless you have certain Items that allow you to use the RED and GRAY dice, Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action.&#10;&#10;The Hunch - Roll each YELLOW Investigate die, one at a time, as dictated by your Stamina. You may also roll the RED and/or GRAY dice, if you have them. You may choose any of the dice to roll next and/or when to apply any rerolls. Each die shows four icons and each repeats two pairs of those icons, as designated by a *. Choosing which dice to roll and when depends on your detective instincts. Each die is different. If you need to roll a 5th or 6th YELLOW die, choose one of your current dice, noting its current face, and roll it again.&#10;&#10;You may subtract an hour of time if your Stamina level is at 1 or 2 to roll an additional YELLOW die. This die may be rolled during the Investigate phase and is lost once the phase has ended.&#10;&#10;You may use matching Twist icons, if you have them, in addition to the dice, by removing their marking cubes on the Criminal card.&#10;&#10;If you can match the Storyline icons, you gain the reward shown in the white area in that row. If you cannot match the icons, you must lose Stamina, Time or your currently held Item, as shown in the brown area in that row.&#10;&#10;If you have failed in your investigation, you may choose one icon from the YELLOW die faces shown and mark this in the Twist section on the Criminal card with a cube. You may save a maximum of 4 Twist icons in this manner.&#10;&#10;3. Confront the Criminal - When the 4th clue is found, draw the top card on the Investigate deck and match the die icon shown to those of the 4 criminals on the Criminal card to discover who you must confront to save the heiress. The row of icons shown for this Criminal must be matched by rolling Investigate dice as listed by your current Stamina. You may only use the icons on the YELLOW Investigate dice to match the Criminal icons, unless you have certain Items which allow you to roll the RED and GRAY dice, saved Twist icons, or your detective&rsquo;s Special Action. You may reroll a YELLOW Investigate die of your choice for every 2 hours of Time remaining in the game, rounding down.

233202,,"A card and board skirmish game for 2 players themed on renaissance warfare with Leonardo da Vinci style inventions. The setting is Italian City States at war circa 1490 - the Fivizzano are invading the Piombino.&#10;&#10;Play is conducted on a 16 x 16 square grid map. Each 8 x 8 section is referred to as a quadrant &ndash; the 2 eastern quadrants are land, the 2 western quadrants are water. The 6 squares of the NE corner of the SW quadrant contain city squares -  the Port City commune of Piombino. The remainder of the map layout is determined at discretion of the players though most of the land spaces should be flat land with a few clumps of forests and mountains and a few solitary hills, villages, and swamps. &#10;One road connects the city to a village or two and then goes off the map. A few Islands dot the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Terrain types will affect the movement of the different unit types.&#10;&#10;There are 11 different unit types: Infantry, Engineers, Cavalry, Artillery, War Machine, Flying Machine, Fortification, Small Warship, Large Warship, Transport and Mine Field.  Each unit type has a move rating, hits score and range, and may have a special capability.&#10;&#10;The players start with a pre-defined army comprising a mix of the various units.  The attacker (the Fivizzano) starts with his units in the bottom half of the Southern quadrants. In addition the Fivizzano gets one roll against the leader table and 4 rolls against the invention table &ndash; these give advantages / enhancements that last for the duration of the battle. The defender (the Piombino) starts with units scattered in the Northern quadrants, one roll against the leader table and 6 against the invention table.&#10;&#10;Players share a Tactics deck comprising cards that mostly give short duration benefits.  These cards can be used, when appropriate, to enhance your own actions or negate those of your opponent&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&#10;&#10;Draw Phase&#10;&#10;     Draw 2 Tactics cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;Move Phase&#10;&#10;     Each of your Units may be moved once up to a number of spaces equal to its move rating. &#10;&#10;&#10;Attack Phase&#10;&#10;      Each of your units may make 1 attack vs. a target within its range. When attacking roll 1D10. On a roll of 7 or higher the attack is successful and the target loses 1 hit. A unit with zero hits is destroyed. &#10;&#10;&#10;End Phase &#10;&#10;     Max Hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The Fivizzano win if they occupy 4 of the spaces of the city. &#10;The Piombinos win if they destroy 20 or more units.&#10;&#10;"

Each player is control of his own race as it evolves and develops from a single cell to spacefaring.&#10;&#10;The game plays in 5 stages (Cell stage, Creature stage, Tribal stage, Civilization stage, Space stage) with each stage having a separate deck of trait cards, and event, challenge type and challenge result tables.  Players move from one stage to the next at different speeds and do not directly interact until the last stage, the Space stage. At the beginning of each stage, each player chooses 1 characteristic for his race &ndash; these characteristics improve a particular attribute for the race.&#10;&#10;Players share a common set of Victory Point Tokens (VT), Food (Resource) Tokens (FT), Hunger Tokens (HT) and Death Tokens (DT).

Next Roll 1D6 (Attribution Roll) and add your level in the indicated Attribute. This is your Attribution Total. &#10;     Next roll 1D6, 2D6, or 3D6 depending on the Strength of the Challenger. &#10;&#10;&#10;This is the Challenge Roll. &#10;&#10;     If the Attribution Total is greater than the Challenge Roll, you win the Challenge. &#10;&#10;&#10;If it is equal or less, you lose the challenge. &#10;&#10;     Refer to that stage&rsquo;s Challenge Result list to determine the benefits or consequences of winning or losing the challenge.&#10;     You may attempt to evade a challenge. If you do so, add +4 to your attribution roll. &#10;&#10;&#10;However if you win, you get no reward.&#10;&#10;Evolution Phase&#10;&#10;     You may gain 1 Trait by playing 1 Trait card from your hand and paying its cost in food or resource tokens. The Trait card stays in play in front of you.  &#10;&#10;&#10;Metabolic Phase&#10;&#10;     Discard 1 Food Token. If you have no food tokens gain 1 hunger token. If you have 2 hunger tokens, discard them and gain 1 death token. &#10;     Max hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;     Determine whether your race moves to the next stage:&#10;         If you have 6 Trait cards in Cell stage in play go on Creature stage. &#10;         If you have 8 Trait cards in Creature stage in play go on Tribal stage. &#10;         If you have won against 5 villages in Tribal stage go onto Civilization stage. &#10;         If you have won against 7 nations in Civilization stage go onto Space Stage. &#10;    &#10;     If going on to the next stage set your old Trait cards aside in your Progress Pile. Except for and VT they might score, these do not apply to later stages. Select a new characteristic for the new stage and discard down to 2 FT or RT. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends after any player has completed his 15th turn in the Space stage at which point scoring is undertaken:&#10;&#10;         Gain 5 VT for completing the Civilization stage and entering the Space stage. &#10;         Add up the VT bonuses from all the Trait cards in your Progress Pile. &#10;         Each Death Token counts as a -2 VT penalty. &#10;         Add or lose VT arising from Events and Challenges. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the most Victory Point Tokens wins.&#10;&#10;"

The green-eyed, light skinned, CEO of a business with a foreign passport. This is when the entire game dynamic switches around, as it turns into a rat race to get married to the dreamy Mr. Right. &#10;The girls then start to make their way towards the aunty by flaunting their talents, such as the fact that they pray 5 times a day, or only have female friends.&#10;&#10;Only one girl makes it in time to marry this Golden Boy, and the rest are hitched off to the mama&rsquo;s boys and womanisers who believe that they&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s gift to humanity.&#10;&#10;"

For each game the board is constructed from four double-sided quarterboards, each of which can be placed either way up and any way round, yielding a total of over 24,000 different 8x8 boards.

Estimating the situation is the key to winning the game.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#142;Trick Taking City&#227;&#128;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#232;&#186;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#228;&#187;&#165;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#174;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;4&#230;&#158;&#154;&times;4&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#186;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#138;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"
