The cards are shuffled again and handed out, two by two, to both players, as for the face-up talon in the middle of the table.&#10;&#10;Turn: Then each player proceeds as so: firstly, he discards a card face up on the table from his hand. If that card matches another card on the table (matching months), the player then wins both cards which he puts in his face-up collection, in front of him. The collection is always displayed in 4 columns, as so: Flowers, Ribbons, Animals and Specials. If it doesn't match anything, the discarded card stays on the table. Secondly, whether it matched or not, the player then draws the first card from the face down deck, and proceeds the same way: if it doesn't match any card, the drawn card stays on the table, but if it does match a card, the player wins both cards which he adds to his collection. Then the other player takes his turn.&#10;&#10;Turn's End: At the end of a player's turn, if he has any Yaku, he can stop the current month (inning) by stating his Yakus, then the points are scored and the next month begins. However, if he wishes to continue in order to increase his score for this month, he says &quot;Koi-Koi&quot; and the other player takes his turn. If later on during the game, the player who said Koi-Koi wins another Yaku OR increases his previous Yakus, he can then again stop the game or say Koi-Koi, as many times as he wants. But if a player gets a Yaku in a game where his opponent already said Koi-Koi, then he gets the right either to say Koi-Koi too, or to stop the game and receive his points, thus leading his opponent to get no points at all this month.&#10;&#10;End: Since each player has 8 cards in his hand, a month (inning) can at worse last 16 turns. In case of a game where one (or both) player(s) said Koi-Koi and no more Yakus have been added or increased before the month ends, then only the last player who said Koi-Koi scores his points as usual. The winner of a month becomes the dealer for the next month, or stays the same if there was not any winner.&#10;&#10;Each Yaku can add itself to the others. Here are the Yakus:&#10;&#10;Basic Yakus&#10;&#10;10 Flowers / Kasu : 1 point (Each additional Flower adds 1 point)&#10;5 Ribbons / Tanzaku : 1 point (Each additional Ribbon adds 1 point)&#10;3 Purple Ribbons (blue) / Aotan : 5 points&#10;3 Ribbons with Poems (red) / Akatan : 5 points&#10;5 Animals / Tane : 1 Point (Each additional Animal adds 1 point)&#10;Doe + Boar + Butterflies / Ino Shika Ch&ocirc; : 5 Points&#10;3 Specials without the Rain Man / Sank&ocirc; : 5 Points&#10;4 Specials with the Rain Man / Ameshik&ocirc; : 6 points&#10;4 Special without the Rain Man / Shik&ocirc; : 8 Points&#10;5 Specials : Gok&ocirc; : 10 points&#10;&#10;Special Yakus&#10;&#10;The Moon + The Sake Cup / Tsukizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)&#10;The Cherry Curtain + The Sake Cup / Hanamizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)&#10;The Iris Flower is a &quot;Joker&quot; card: it can either be counted as an Animal, or as Flower to form a Kasu (but not both).&#10;The 4 Cards of the current Month / TsukiFuda : 5 points&#10;No Yakus / OyaKen : 1 point&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player reaches 50 points. In some variants, at the end of a month, the points scored by a player are subtracted from his opponent's score. In some variants, the player with the most points at the end of the year (December) wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

For example, the letter &quot;C&quot; could become &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Could&quot; or any word that you choose beginning with the letter &quot;C&quot;.&#10;&#10;So, if you were dealt a hand consisting of the letters:  M,F,G,A,B,P, you could create the sentence: &quot;Freddy's Billy Goat Ate Pancakes Monday&quot;...or &quot;Get Powder Because My Foot Aches!&quot;.  You can arrange the cards in any order to create your sentence.  But you are under a time limit and the time depends on how many cards you are dealt (anywhere from 5-7 depending on the roll of the die).  There is also an action card that you must draw before turning over your cards.  The action cards give you an instruction for completing your sentence, such as &quot;Your sentence must be in the form of a question&quot; or &quot;Do not use a proper name&quot;.&#10;&#10;Points are at the bottom of every card.  You accumulate points by creating an acceptable sentence within the time limit.

11929,,"&quot;Go-Moku&quot; (Japanese - also spelled &quot;Gomoku&quot;) or &quot;wuziqi&quot; (Chinese) is a very old game played with a Go set. The game can also be played on a sheet of graph paper using X's and O's. It is similar in idea to tic-tac-toe, but far greater in scale and complexity.  The name means &quot;five points.&quot;&#10;&#10;It is debated whether this game originated in China or Japan, with more evidence pointing to the former.&#10;&#10;The object is to get five stones in a row.  The game is played on a 19x19 board (such as the board used in Go), creating a large and open field to complete this objective. The game can also be played on a smaller board, such as the popular 15x15 option.&#10;&#10;If played perfectly, Black (who goes first) can always win the game. Even before this was proven, the game was recognized to be easier for Black. This problem is solved with the swap2 opening setup: place two black and a white stone; the other player then can take the white stones and play, take the black stones and pass, or place one more of each stone and give you the final choice. From then on play as normal, no need for during-play restrictions on black as in Renju which was often seen as the adult contemporary to the kids' Go-Moku.&#10;&#10;"

11933,,"While Minitar has an ostensible political theme (the 1968 US presidential election), in fact it is a completely abstract game.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of cards depicting the 50 states and Washington DC, plus a wild card.  On a turn a player draws a card and places it on the 8x8 board.  If it is the first card played in one of the rows in the player's half of the board, it can go anywhere in that row, otherwise it must be adjacent to one of his or her already-placed cards.  In addition, a card can be played on top of the opponent's card showing the same state (and the wild card can be played on top of any card).&#10;&#10;The object is to connect the two ends of the board with a chain of cards in your color.  Whoever manages this gets points equal to the number of electoral votes for the states in the chain.  A match is won by the first player to reach 538 points.  It is also possible to win a game by making it impossible for the other player to move.&#10;&#10;As the rules are quite simple, most of the 28-page rulebook is taken up by background information - on the US as it was in the 1960 census, politicians holding office in the states and the federal government, the 1956, 1960, and 1964 elections, etc.&#10;&#10;"

Players have Ice Cream Sunday cups with 3 flavors of ice cream and various toppings in front of them with a group of ice cream cards in the middle.  In turn, the players pull an ice cream card and click the included scoop which will show either chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.  Whichever player has the Ice Cream Sunday cup with the flavor just spun and the topping matching the ice cream card gets the ice cream card in his bowl.  Keep doing this until all of the ice cream cards are taken.&#10;&#10;Basically, this a game where you are trying to match patterns.  The ice cream scoop randomizer is one of the more interesting randomizer methods in a game.&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to find out which two players have the same card &mdash; that is, which two players LINQ &mdash; by listening to the clue words that all the players give. For example, if the LINQ word is blue, a player holding that card might say ocean. A player who is bluffing might follow by saying shell. It's not yet clear who has the LINQ, until the other player can describe blue in a different context.&#10;&#10;After round one has been completed, players can guess who they think has the LINQ, or pass on guessing until after round two.

Otherwise, move the number rolled without changing your direction, as that can only change when on a junction station.&#10;&#10;As well, many of the stations have a signal on them to follow: amber (pick up another destination), green (usually good, useful cards), or red (frequently bad - adding destination, or flinging you to an end of the board).
