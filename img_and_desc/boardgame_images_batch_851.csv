In one game civilizations rise while in the other players battle over whether the great Persian Empire will survive. Both games emphasize simplicity but not at the price of being unrealistic.&#10;&#10;From Sumeria to Persia is about the Bronze and Iron Age, when civilization was born and city states went from kingdoms and finally to large empires, culminating in the Persian Empire founded by Cyrus the Great. Players of History of the World will recognize the base mechanics whereby players randomly select civilizations from cards, although the player in last place has more power to decide which civilization they will play.&#10;&#10;From Sumeria to Persia does offer players more options than previous games on the subject. Civilizations that survive can continue to expand in future turns. Random events create possibilities that defy history but were in the realm of possibility. The Minoans may have a brilliant military commander and the Egyptians could become a seafaring empire. There are also rules for constructing wonders, the placement of cities, and the general effects of the Bronze Age collapse. Lastly, the Persian Empire does appear.&#10;&#10;Alexander vs. Darius: The Fall of the Persian Empire simulates Alexander III&rsquo;s conquest of the great Persian Empire. Sometimes portrayed as a foregone conclusion, this game argues that Persia certainly had a chance to win if they had used different strategies or had some luck on the battlefield. Darius III need not have been Persia&rsquo;s last king.&#10;&#10;The heart of Alexander vs. Darius is a war weariness track, which moves down steadily for Alexander&rsquo;s army. Historically, it did not reach zero until after his invasion of India, but a Persian battlefield victory could have changed that. The game also allows players to explore Memnon&rsquo;s strategy of using Persian naval supremacy to raid Alexander&rsquo;s rear as well as exploring the possibilities of the Spartan rebellion. Lastly, the Persians themselves must worry about legitimacy, and therefore must be active in resisting Alexander, or risk losing their grip on the throne.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

West of Elsenborn Ridge, near the cities of Li&egrave;ge and Spa, Belgium, was a vast array of Allied supplies and the well-developed road network leading to the Meuse River and Antwerp. The Germans planned on using two key rollbahns or routes through the area to seize Antwerp and force a separate peace with the United States and Britain. Capturing Monschau and the nearby village of H&ouml;fen, and the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt just east of Elsenborn Ridge, were key to the success of the German plans, and Hitler committed his best armored units and infantry troops to the area, including the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend.&#10;&#10;The green, untested troops of the 99th Infantry Division had been placed in the sector during mid-November because the Allies thought it was an area unlikely to see battle. Their soldiers were stretched thin over a 22-mile front, and all three regiments were on line, with no reserve. In early December, the 2nd Infantry Division was assigned to capture a vital crossroads marked by a customs house and a forester&rsquo;s lodge named Wahlerscheid, at the southern tip of the Battle of H&uuml;rtgen Forest. They transitioned through the 99th division's lines and after a deadly, costly battle, capturing the crossroads. But the Germans counterattacked in what the Americans initially thought was a localized spoiling action, but was actually a leading element of the Battle of the Bulge. The 2nd ID consolidated their lines, pulling back into H&uuml;nningen, and then to the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt, and finally at the dug-in positions held by the 99th ID at Elsenborn Ridge.&#10;&#10;What you get in ATS Battle of the Twin Villages:&#10;&#10;ALL the combat counters you need to play&#10;New, large-hex winterized map for the historical battlefield&#10;Color Battlefield Walkaround rules in 3-hole format&#10;Color scenario format, bloody warm red you know the drill!&#10;Monster scenario to tie it all together without all that ordering from a Chinese restaurant menu &gt; they were there, you plop them down and get rolling!&#10;AFV Cards for all the AFVs in the module&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Earn your pointe shoes and tutu; collect gems, treasures and the tiara.&#10;&#10;In On Pointe players use dance moves as shown on the deck of cards to move through the game from the first dance studio through rehearsal and eventually to the stage.  Players stop at certain intervals in the game to collect gems, which are worth 3 points and treasures, which are worth 2 points.&#10;&#10;Each player has a score card where they accumulate the items for later end-of-game scoring.  Points are also awarded for landing on the Pas de Deux squares, the Prima Ballerina square where one player will get the tiara and the final stage square for the bouquet and bow.&#10;&#10;In addition to the cards, each player has five 'Position Tokens' each of which can only be used once and then is turned over after executing the given 'power-up' move or action.&#10;&#10;The player who is positioned last, in relation to the front edge of the stage gets first selection of movement cards shown on the table and play proceeds clock-wise from there.  The result of this turn designation is that players tend to travel though the game board fairly closely together.&#10;&#10;Since the winner is determined by a calculation of points, arriving first at the end of the stage does not guarantee a win.&#10;&#10;On Pointe is a dancer's journey in a board game.&#10;&#10;"

With this &quot;foreign interference&quot; as an excuse, the Persian empire decided to invade Greece. In 492 BC the Persian forces attacked Macedonia from land and sea. The Persians and the Greeks fought fiercely at Marathon, Thermopylae, and Salamis. Against the overwhelming forces of the Persian empire, the Greeks used superior tactics and &quot;weapons&quot; such as hoplites (heavy infantry) and triremes. The Greeks had also excellent leaders in times of crises and eventually prevailed over the Persians.&#10;&#10;300: Earth &amp; Water is a wargame for two players. One player controls the Greeks, gathered around the Athenians, and the other controls the Persians, fighting for the hegemony of the eastern Mediterranean. Through all five expeditions, each player aims to control more cities than their opponent.&#10;&#10;The game engine is a &quot;card driven&quot; system. Players raise armies and buy cards during production. Cards can be used to play an event or move an army or fleet. Events can provide advantages in battles or interfere with the enemy, but military action is paramount to win. Moreover, each game will change dramatically according the order the events occur.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple and the playing time is short, but both Greece and Persia have a wide range of strategies, so victory will challenge both players.&#10;&#10;"

Building and running an economically viable farm will require the skillful management of resources as well as the strategic deployment and timely slaughter of cattle for income. Along the way you will also raise revenue by milking your cows, breeding cattle and sending your herd to graze on both your own and your opponent's farm, all while attempting to defend your own patch of grass from your similarly inclined neighbor.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of cards from which they play farmland, cattle, action, enrichment, and building cards. Farmland cards are free to play and produce grass which can be spent to play other cards. Any unspent grass can be grazed on by your opponent's cattle to earn money. Money can also be earned by milking cows or slaughtering cattle. Action and enrichment cards directly affect the player or other cards in play. The winner is the first player to earn 100 coins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

A magical game of unicorns that is simple and fun for all. Get the most unicards by matching mane color, hoof color, and horn color to the unicard you wish.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of 5 cards. Most cards have a unicorn on them with a colored mane, hooves, or horn in one of the 7 colors of the rainbow. Cards are also marked with a shape to help differentiate colors and for help with the colorblind.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player draws a card from the top of the deck or the discard pile. Once a player has three matching color unicorn cards of all three types (hooves, horn, and mane) they may discard all three and claim that color Unicard.&#10;&#10;Unicards are separate from the cards used in the deck and player hands. There are 7 Unicards, one for each of the colors of the rainbow, and the first player to claim 4 Unicards wins the game. But be careful, because other players can steal your UniCards by also matching the same colors.&#10;&#10;Also included are rainbow unicorns that can be used as any color and the dark horse which prevents you from winning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

A &quot;kunoichi&quot; is a female ninja, and &quot;kunoichi ni chikai&quot; means &quot;almost a kunoichi&quot; - but you could also read it as &quot;close to the ku&quot;. But what's &quot;ku&quot;? It's a little pink token in the box! Use the powers of your kunoichi trainees to move them around in the grid and get closer to the &quot;ku&quot;!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game sixteen cards, one for each character, are laid out in a four by four grid. The players are dealt an equal number of cards, each corresponding to one of the ninjas. Each card has a different ability to move cards around, like &quot;swap any card and the one two to the right and one down from it&quot; or &quot;slide any column up, wrapping around&quot;. After each player has used all but one of their cards, the last card determines which ninja they get points for, with more points going to ninjas closer to the &quot;ku&quot;.&#10;&#10;In order to win you'll have to use your powers to rearrange the grid while balancing that with holding on a character in a good position, even if they have good powers. You also have to be careful not to favor any character too obviously as other players can interrupt your plans.&#10;&#10;Can you get close to the &quot;ku&quot; and finally become a full kunoichi?&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

The mystical and hysterical game of Trust Me, I'm Psychic might change your thinking!&#10;&#10;In this unpredictable game of predictions, one player acts as the Customer, asking a question about their future that the Psychics must answer. All other players act as Psychics, and are dealt a Vision card that tells them if they are a true Psychic or a Fraud. All the players who are true Psychics see the same tarot-inspired image that they can use to craft a fortune for the customer. The Frauds do not see the picture, and will just have to wing it (with some help from the Cursed Words clues on their card)!&#10;&#10;The Customer asks a question on any subject about his or her future. Will I win the lottery? Will I find true love this year? Whether you are a Psychic or a Fraud, use your imagination to spin a fantastical fortune for the Customer. Of course, fortune-telling is not as easy as it seems. Psychics and Frauds must avoid speaking the forbidden Cursed Words listed at the bottom of their cards. If your fellow Psychics/Frauds catch you saying a Cursed Word, you'll get a Curse Token.&#10;&#10;If you tell a convincing fortune the Customer rewards you with a token and gets to look at your card. If the Customer chose a true Psychic, they can use the image on the card to deduce who the remaining Psychics are. But if the Customer accidentally pays a Fraud, he or she gets a Curse Token.&#10;&#10;The game ends after each player has a turn being the Customer.
