You get three actions a turn to buy cards which then let you lay tiles to control land and herds, or you may buy extras, such as waterholes or the haciendas of the title to get bonus points.&#10;&#10;The game has two card decks, one showing the different land types on the hex map, the other the different animals (pigs, cows, horses and sheep). Some cards are laid face up and you pay 3 pesos to buy the ones you want, or 2 pesos for an unknown card from the draw deck. You spend the cards to put your markers on land and to place your animal tokens on the board. Animals of a type go together to make a herd naturally, and each time a herd touches a market town on the board, you earn money for the size of herd and land attached. With careful hand and herd management, you can make good cash gains and also block your opponents. You need the money to buy more cards of course. 12 pesos also buys waterholes you can place next to your herds, or haciendas to go on your land or herds. If you run short of money, you can call a harvest and get cash off your land.&#10;&#10;But the game is not about money. You score victory points halfway through the game and at the end. The more markets you are serving, the more points you get. The herds and the land get you points. The water and haciendas get you bonus points as well, which can be crucial to your success.&#10;&#10;It should be noted, the game board has two sides: a symmetrical dog-bone shape of land types (appears in most of the photos), and a &quot;random&quot; more varied pattern of land types.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.spielbyweb.com/ (turn-based)&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The scale of the game is a 1:1 representation of men and equipment. Time scale is one game turn equals 2 and a half minutes; ground scale is 1 inch equals 10 meters. The miniatures are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle teams (3-4 figures), light machine gun teams (2 figures), leaders (1 figure) and weapons teams (2-4 figures depending on the weapon). Tanks and vehicles are mounted singly. Infantry units are made up of two or more rifle teams and zero to two light machine gun teams.&#10;&#10;The rules work very well for representing actions on a platoon or company scale. The rules are best for infantry actions. The rules for tanks are not very detailed: one die roll to see if a hit is made, another for the result based on a comparison of the penetrative ability of gun firing with the overall armor quality of the target. However, they tend to give as good an end result as more complex rules. Anti-tank weapons range from the PzB38/39 and PTRD AT rifles to massive 128mm and 152mm AT guns.&#10;&#10;GSRS provides rules for hidden set up, pre-battle recon, weather, command control, and target location that can be used to make challenging game scenarios. There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules for things like Panzer Aces, Heroes of the Soviet Union, and civilians in the combat zone. The rules also cover the use of cavalry and air support.&#10;&#10;The rules includes a lot of information about unit organization, AFV data, and aircraft data. There is also a section detailing the differences between Soviet and German tactics and capabilities.&#10;&#10;GSRS is a somewhat obscure and underrated set of miniatures rules that provides a great deal of flavor and compares very well to tactical boardgames like Squad Leader, ASL, and the Advanced Tobruk (ATS) series.&#10;&#10;"

In the most common scoring system, a player wins two betting units when two of their hands are stronger than another player's corresponding hands, and four betting units when all three of their hands are stronger. So for example, if Player A's back hand was a full house, his middle hand was two pair, and his front hand a pair of jacks, while Player B's corresponding hands were a flush, three-of-a-kind, and a pair of nines, Player B would owe Player A two betting units.&#10;&#10;Other scoring options include bonuses for especially strong hands (e.g., you win four extra bets if your back or middle hand is a straight flush), and &quot;surrender,&quot; which allows you to throw away a particularly bad set of cards and just pay a fixed penalty fee to each opponent.&#10;&#10;In another variant, if you have all fours, you instantly win.&#10;&#10;"

Second, over half of the cards in WTF contain blanks and you get to fill them in and finish the rules!  You might get a card that lets you determine how many points players gain or lose, or you might get a card that lets you require all players to perform some ridiculous task of your choosing.  Each card simply must follow on the &quot;suit&quot; of the previous card -- but many of the suits are made up by the players as they play! The big catch is that you actually write on the cards each game, so your deck is always changing.  The result is that the card that seemed funny when it made the player to your left eat his own earwax is a lot less funny when it comes back around to the player on your right!  For even more excitement, you can mix up your deck with another friend's deck and see what happens.

It's the kind of game for those nights when you'd like to play something, but don't want to commit to a traditional fantasy sports simulation.&#10;&#10;One of the great mysteries of the sport of Elfball is just where it began, and how it got its name. The Elves of the vast forests of the Westerlands claim to have been playing the sport since the dawn of time, and that they named it in honor of themselves. The Dwarves and Orcs, high in their mountain homes, dispute this bold claim and insist that the game&rsquo;s name instead refers to the type of severed head that makes the best ball core; both races maintain that they are in fact the originators and some of the bloodiest wars in the history of the realms have been fought over this claim. The men of the Middle Kingdoms ignore the squabbles of the elder races and call the game De Circque instead.&#10;&#10;Today Elfball is played by every nation and tribe of the world, and with a few regional variations, it is played the same on fields throughout The Realms. The design of the field, the distinctive ball, and the rules of play are all quite standardized.&#10;&#10;This game was prototyped in 2002 by Phigs Miniatures but did not see production until the game rules were overhauled and changed about 80% from the prototype and then released by Impact! Miniatures in 2007.&#10;&#10;"

As a player you have been invited to a wild party along with twelve naughty but nice characters.

Bedroom, den, kitchen, etc, with an outside garden, pool, and entrance way. The objective of the game is to move various characters about from room to room, with the intent of gathering as many together in a room as possible. You must have the characters and the room card to score points. So as you move a character towards a room to have a group seduction with other character cards you have in hand, another player may have the same character card, and wishes this character to have a seduction with the players they are gathering in a different part/room of the estate. The more people you can gather in a room together the more points you score. There are optional rules that allow for gay seductions. Like Ticket to ride, the longer the track built the more points, in Lovers Wild the more characters in a room having a seduction, the more points. Multiples of characters must be as equal as possible, if 5 people in a room are having a seduction, 2 or 3 must be women, one woman and four men does not make an seduction or scoring hand. Fast moving game, lay your hand for points if you can, draw a card, move a character. The more players the more difficult larger seductions are. The board in nicely done, and character chits are humorous with a variety of people types, that fits well in with game, with names like Hands a Roaming, Lucy Love Lace, Dolly Pardon. This may be another game lost to the gaming world, where even the author could not put me onto a replacement copy.&#10;&#10;"
