They practice handling goods and money, learn to compare prices and take important steps towards their independence.&#10;&#10;Children must be able to count to four and compare numbers.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a shopping list showing 4 different goods and a purse with maximal 8 coins. In turns, players throw a dice yielding a number between 2 and 4, and move on ways between a common home, the bank and the four shops. The home is the starting place, the shops allow purchases and the bank allows to refill the purse. The first player to return home with all 4 goods on his shopping list purchased wins. Very simple.&#10;&#10;There are 9 different shopping goods: 3 meat products, 3 bakery products and 3 fruit/vegetable products. There are four copies of each product in the game. The butcher/bakery/greengrocery hold three copies of each meat/bakery/veggie product respectively and one copy of each product is found at the delicatessen shop.&#10;&#10;Out of its stock of 9 goods per shop, only three are on display and up for sale at a time. Goods cost between 1 and 3 coins each, depending on its display slot, clearly marked by a price tag showing coins above each good. Upon purchase, all remaining goods a shifted to the left (the cheap places) and new goods from the stock fill up the empty expensive places on the right.&#10;&#10;This may sound more complicated than it is: a three year old easily understands it and can execute the simple mechanic, thanks to arrows and price tags showing coins and not numbers. What a three year old that is yet unfamiliar with boardgames might not immediately appreciate, is the neat balancing behind the mechanic: unsold products decrease in price, whereas sought-after products increase in price; that buying bread at the delicatessen is more expensive than at the bakery, both in terms of money and distance to travel, but that the delicatessen may save travel between different shops, etc. However, learning this by playing is the hidden educational goal of the game.&#10;&#10;"

One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria's enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria's ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.&#10;&#10;Maria is derived from the award-winning Friedrich: Anniversary Edition, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony's betrayal and Prussia's annexation of Silesia. Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory. However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin.&#10;&#10;Maria takes you to the era of the 18th century's ruthless struggle for power. It can be played in 2 variants: the shorter, simplified introductory game or the longer but richer advanced game, with its simultaneous campaigns in Bohemia and Flanders.&#10;&#10;"

In addition to the added suit (stars), the 5D deck gives each suit its own unique color and theme. It also adds a '1' card (distinct from the ace) and a 'P' (princess) face card, as well as including a joker for each suit. Thus, the deck includes 80 cards in total.&#10;&#10;The deck has been made available in a number of different formats that differ in packaging, accessories (such as score sheets), and game rules included. The publisher's web site  www.jeudecartes5d.com provided rules for 14 games as of the end of 2008, albeit only in French.&#10;&#10;"

Collect 3 complete property sets, but beware Debt Collectors, Forced Deals and the dreaded Deal Breakers, which could change your fortunes at any time!&#10;&#10;MONOPOLY DEAL - the card game where anything can happen!&#10;&#10;How to win: Be the first player to collect 3 three full property sets of different colors.&#10;&#10;The Cards: &#10;Action Cards may be played to initiate the action printed on the card or may be used as money of the value noted in the upper left and lower right corners.&#10;Property Cards some denote a specific property and some are wild.  They show property name, set to which they belong (or in which sets they may be used), rental costs, number of properties in their set and their value when used to make payments. &#10;House/Hotel Cards may be used to increase the rental cost of a property set.  They also have a monetary value for use in making payments.&#10;Money Cards are used to make payments.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;Draw two cards from the draw pile, or if you start your turn with no cards, draw five.&#10;Play up to three cards from your hand face up either as: money into your bank, properties or improvements into your collection, or actions.  Action cards allow you to collect rent, receive money, take properties from others or cancel another action.  Cards placed in your bank may only be used as money.  When you must make a payment, you may use money from your bank or properties and improvements in your collection, but not cards in your hand.&#10;Discard cards in excess of seven from your hand to the bottom of the draw pile.&#10;&#10;Win by announcing it on your turn when you have three complete property sets of different colors.  This ends the game.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with Monopoly Deal, a 'lite' version of the same game that came out in 2014.&#10;&#10;"

If the player is unable to answer correctly, he or she must stay on the square and continue answering questions on subsequent turns until successful.
