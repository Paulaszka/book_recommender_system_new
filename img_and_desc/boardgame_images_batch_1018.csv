The games live in the same universe, but they&rsquo;re totally different. For starters, one is a video game and one is a card game. Also, one is an 8-player party game about making funny characters and the other is a 2-player combat strategy card game.&#10;&#10;Champ&rsquo;d Up: Slam Down is a unique two-player card game where each player takes the role of a trainer battling champs against their opponent until only one player is left standing/sitting! Each turn you will recruit champs from your hand into the ring to fight your opponent&rsquo;s champs. Deplete your opponent&rsquo;s reserves and call them out to declare victory and win the game!&#10;&#10;To get a pack (you only need one), play an online game of Champ&rsquo;d Up in The Jackbox Party Pack 7. Create ridiculous champs and battle them for supremacy. But draw with care because these champs are going to make their way into the physical world! After your game, you can purchase a pack of Champ&rsquo;d Up: Slam Down cards with the characters you created in Champ&rsquo;d Up. It will be custom printed and delivered right to your door. When you receive your cards, grab a friend and play this simple but exciting take on a 1-on-1 collectable card game. Combine decks and trade cards with others for even more ridiculous mayhem.&#10;&#10;Players will take turns until a player wins the game. The player who is taking a turn is referred to as the &ldquo;active player.&rdquo; At the very start of their turn, the active player gets 3 energy. On the active player's turn, they can use energy to execute a variety of actions: Recruit, Hype, Fight, use Special abilities, and Call out their Opponent. Slam Down's custom cards means a diverse variety of cards can be printed from playing Champ'd Up (in the Jackbox Party Pack 7) repeat times. Fighting is how players remove opposing champs from the ring. If the active player has a champ in the ready position and their opponent has no players in the ring, the active player can call them out. If the active player calls out an opponent with no champs in their reserve, the game ends and they win the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each turn represents a year and consists of a winter administration phase and two campaign seasons. &#10;Campaigns are likely to last three to five years (although a spectacular failure could see a campaign concluded in a single year) and likely to feature an average of three battles per year.&#10;&#10;During winter players spend their budget to bribe/persuade Greek city states in a variety of ways to make them amenable to a player's plans and to buy new elements to reinforce armies in the following year. &#10;During each of the two campaign seasons players move their army or armies on the map and invade hostile Greek states, the armies of which are played by the opposing player.&#10;&#10;The winner of the campaign will be the player who allies the greatest number of Greek states, or at least renders them neutral, by the time either Macedon or Persia cannot field an army sufficiently strong to continue.&#10;&#10;Although written with this specific hypothetical campaign as its basis, the campaign mechanisms are portable to other eras and armies, with the requirement only that the player create an appropriate point to point map of the area of operations. The article includes half a dozen ways in which to vary the original campaign and brief notes suggesting other historical conflicts of the classical period which might be simulated.&#10;&#10;The article is fourteen pages long and incorporates a campaign map and a budget tracking graphic.&#10;&#10;Finally it also presents a very simple methodology for resolving battles in a DBA style using any flat surface and 30 or so dice of different colours.
