Players compete to build the longest caterpillar from tiles depicting heads, body segments and tails. To do this they take turns spinning a plastic pointer. When it stops, it will point to either a head tile, a body tile or a tail tile. The player picks up a tile of the indicated kind and adds it to the caterpillar he is currently building in front of him. A complete caterpillar has a head, at least one body tile, and a tail. A player must complete his current caterpillar before beginning a new one. If his caterpillar needs a tail, and the pointer stops at a head or a body tile, he may not pick up a tile but must try again on his next turn. There is nothing players can do the affect the outcome. Longest caterpillar at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;There are 40 body tiles, 8 head tiles and 8 tail tiles. All heads are different but they are all happy faces, some with hats and so on. It doesn't really matter which heads you choose, but this may still seem important to young players. It is also the only decision players make.&#10;&#10;Scandinavian edition Larven Freddy (&quot;Freddy the Caterpillar&quot;) was published by Brio under the Joker label, but the copyright belongs to John Waddington Ltd.

The score card consists of jutting triangles of different colors and boxed numbers in 5 colors.&#10;The arrow-heads are dealt out to players face down.  Each player in turn places an arrow-head on either the score card or a previously played arrow-head so that the color of the head matches the color of the tail it fits into, thereby creating a box of one color.  Players attempt to optimize their score by finding the match for their arrow-head that results in the largest available score on the score card.  The score is recorded each time an arrow-head is played.  If there is no available match for the player, he forfeits his turn, and must try again with the same arrow-head next turn.&#10;Play continues until all arrow-heads have been played.  The winner has the highest total.&#10;&#10;"

In the catalogue for the exhibition, Asian Games: The Art of Contest, the following names for this game are mentioned:&#10;hulu pan (gourd board) - southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong area&#10;hulu qi (gourd chess) in Hong Kong&#10;hulu wen (gourd puzzle)in Suzhou&#10;fenghuang qi (male and female phoenix chess)in places such as Tianjin, Weixian (Shandong Province), and Chengdu (Sichuan Province).&#10;&#10;I know it, in Singapore, as Hor Lor Boon.&#10;&#10;This game is played on a board showing a spiral track and the object is to move one's piece from the outside into the center of the track first(q.v. Game of Goose and Sheng Guan Tu). The track is made up of individual symbols which will be repeated once on the board. Players roll two dice and move the number of symbols along the track. Wherever they land, they will then jump to the corresponding symbol elsewhere on the board (which could be a help or a hindrance). It's not necessary to land exactly on the center square to win - passing it also wins.&#10;&#10;The symbols may vary, but are usually traditional or mythological Chinese figures (e.g. the Eight Immortals, creatures from the Chinese zodiac) and would include a gourd (hor lor).&#10;&#10;A contemporary set made in China called cai shen you xi qi (God of fortune game) has two pieces for each player - presumably the roll can only apply to one of the pieces in this version (the rules are not clear on this). The rules for this version state that if a piece is supposed to land on a space occupied by another piece, it remains where it is and the piece it would have landed on is sent back to the start. The board features the God of Fortune as the central space that all the players are trying to reach.&#10;&#10;"

Only the magical cassette can point you in the right direction.&#10;&#10;Gameplay information:&#10;Every square on the board represents one of Tintin's adventures and contains a black totem pole. You have to use a magnet to learn if the totem is a good one or a trap. If the totem moves away from the magnet, it is a trap. If it pulls towards you it is one of the 8 good ones. Players check the totems individually and place it on the middle of the appropriate adventure square. This means the nature of this totem is known to one of the players. He must memorize all the totems he checked. In the second part (when all totems are known by one or more players), when a player starts an the adventure players have to tell the other players what status the totem has, if he is right he gets the totem. If he gets it wrong he loses a research point.&#10;&#10;When all 8 good totems are found the golden Rastapopoulos totem is placed for the final adventure. When players cross Rastapopoulos himself they have to fight him (by a throw of the dice).&#10;&#10;When a player loses all his points he has to start at the beginning of the board and receives 4 new points to re-enter the race until the golden totem is reached.&#10;&#10;"

After each roll, you can either stop or keep rolling.  If you stop and your pawn is the most advanced pawn in that column, then you remove any pawn it passed.  If it is not the most advanced, then you remove your pawn from the challenge board.  If your pawn has not been removed from the board by your next turn, then you score points for it on the score track.&#10;&#10;You can keep rolling dice to advance your pawn farther up the challenge board, but when you accumulate three or more ones, your parents have caught you picking on your sibling.

His duties are as follows: he selects a card from the deck; he scrambles the letters of a word on the card, which is indicated by the board or the second die; he presents that scrambled word; he determines who is the first to correctly identify the word (and whether a tie has taken place). The other players have one minute to identify the word. The first to identify the word gains (or keeps) control of the dice.&#10;If no player correctly identifies the word, play continues to the left.&#10;&#10;This process continues until a winner is determined.&#10;&#10;"
