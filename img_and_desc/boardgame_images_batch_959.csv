But the Tikis' head are filled with nonsense and they try to trump each other. Kanaloa himself has to intervene to get everything back in line and protect the sailors from the danger of the shallows, the octopus. Who will claim victory with the help of the right Tikis and sail towards the sunset as the lucky winner?&#10;&#10;Aim of the game:&#10;The aim is to take the most tricks by skillfully playing cards to get ahead as fast as possible with your boat and to outrun the slowest player.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The game consists of several rounds. One round is always played as follows:&#10;&#10;     The starting player opens a round by playing a card from their hand.&#10;     The other players now also play one card each in turn.&#10;     Check to see who took the trick. This player may move their boat forward to the next free water space. Any occupied spaces are skipped.&#10;     Before the player who has taken the trick plays a card for the next trick, they announce the trump suit for the next trick out loud. The suit on the water space on which the leading boat is placed is always trumps.&#10;     A round is finished once all cards have been played and 8 tricks have been taken.&#10;     After the player who took the last trick has moved their boat forward, they remove any free water card from the sea route. So the sailing route gets shorter and shorter during the game.&#10;     The player who took the last trick starts the next round. They shuffle all the cards, deal 8 cards to each player and lay a card for the first trick.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player&lsquo;s boat laps the last boat on the sea route.

The Russian Front, 1941-44 is a new single map game design by renowned Japanese game designer, Masahiro Yamazaki. This edition features a mounted map and delivers an eminently-playable experience inspired by his original, two-map War for the Motherland release that can be played to completion in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;The game begins with Operation Barbarossa marking the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and culminates towards the end of the war when the Russians had effectively driven back the German forces and were entering the final stages of the epic struggle on the Eastern Front when the tide had completely turned.&#10;&#10;This all-new game design borrows from some of the lessons learned from the larger two-map game, War for the Motherland, and compacts the scope and design of the game into a very playable yet illuminating game covering the struggle for the Eastern Front that can be completed in a single sitting. For example, the larger War for the Motherland game involves more units and takes 40 turns to complete, whereas this compact design has fewer units and only takes 22 turns to complete. Players will also appreciate the upgraded components featuring a mounted game map and 5/8&Prime; counters. For the East Front aficionado, this is a must-buy for those familiar with Yamazaki&rsquo;s great contributions in covering the East Front who now delivers this sleek, new compact design.&#10;&#10;The game includes six scenarios: &#10;&#10;     Operation Barbarossa (7 Game-Turns)&#10;     The Road to Stalingrad (12 Game-Turns)&#10;     Fall Blau (10 Game-Turns)&#10;     Operation Uranus (3 Game-Turns)&#10;     Operation Zitadelle (7 Game-Turns)&#10;     War for the Motherland campaign (22 Game-Turns) &#10;&#10;&#10;One of the enjoyable new twists implemented for the strength chit system is the variable and increasing combat chit strength for the Soviets over time to model the increasing combat effectiveness of the Soviet Armies.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: 5 out of 10&#10;Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)&#10;Time Scale: 1 or 2 months per turn&#10;Map Scale: 74 km per hex&#10;Unit Scale: Army (Soviets, Axis Minors) and Corps (German)&#10;Players: 2&#10;Playing Time: 2-5 hours for scenarios, 8+ hours for campaign&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Mounted mapboard&#10;Five countersheets (5/8&Prime; size)&#10;Rules booklet&#10;Three player aid cards&#10;Four Order of Arrival cards&#10;Four Deployment cards&#10;Two six-sided dice&#10;Box and Lid&#10;&#10;Game Credits:&#10;&#10;Designer: Masahiro Yamazaki&#10;Graphic Design: Masahiro Yamazaki&#10;Package Design: Masahiro Yamazaki, Brien Miller&#10;Project Director: John Kranz&#10;Box Cover Design: Bruce Yearian&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;"

Its companion books (Warhammer 40,000: Wargear (2nd Edition), Codex Imperialis, Codex Army Lists) were devoted to background, wargear and army lists, while the Rulebook detailed how to play the game. It contains 8 pages of full-colour images in the centre, a weapon summary and quick reference sheet at the end. The combat rules and shooting were identical to those of Necromunda. The much more complex nature of the rules meant that games were intended to be played on a much smaller scale than the current Warhammer 40,000 rules.&#10;&#10;Box Contents:&#10;&#10;Game rules and background:&#10;Warhammer 40,000 Rulebook&#10;Warhammer 40,000 Wargear (weapons and wargear rules}&#10;Warhammer 40,000 Codex lmperialis (background for game factions plus rules for different units/characters}&#10;Warhammer 40,000 Codex army lists&#10;Warhammer 40,000 Battle for Armageddon scenarios (scenarios that make use of boxed game miniatures}&#10;Warhammer 40,000 How to paint your models&#10;How to play Warhammer 40,000 (a &lsquo;getting started&rsquo; run through of the rules)&#10;Warhammer 40,000 Rules summary card&#10;Warhammer 40,000 Weapons summary card&#10;&#10;Miniatures:&#10;20 Orks (bolt pistol and axe)&#10;40 Gretchin (autogun)&#10;1 cardboard Ork dreadnought and stand&#10;2 Space Marine Sergeants (bolt pistol and chainsword)&#10;2 Space Marines with flamers&#10;2 Space Marines with rocket launchers&#10;14 Space Marines with bolters&#10;&#10;Vehicle Datafaxes:&#10;1 Space Marine Rhino&#10;1 Space Marine Dreadnought&#10;1 Space Marine Predator&#10;1 Space Marine Land Raider&#10;1 Space Ork Dreadnought&#10;1 Space Ork Battlewagon&#10;&#10;Wargear Cards:&#10;1 Bionic Eye&#10;1 Combi-weapon&#10;1 Conversion Field&#10;1 Displacer Field&#10;1 Firepike&#10;2 Haywire Grenades&#10;1 Retractor Field&#10;1 Scanner&#10;2 Vortex Grenades&#10;1 Web Of Skulls&#10;&#10;Mission Cards (one of each pair is green and the other is blue):&#10;2 &lsquo;Engage and Destroy&rsquo; mission cards&#10;2 &lsquo;The Assassins&rsquo; mission cards&#10;2 &lsquo;Dawn Raid&rsquo; mission cards&#10;2 &lsquo;Take and Hold&rsquo; mission cards&#10;&#10;Play aids:&#10;20 cardboard ruins&#10;3 squad references cards (1 Space Marine, 1 Ork, 1 Gretchin)&#10;Victory point record chart&#10;1 vehicle turning template&#10;1 Thudgun template (made of four connected 1&rdquo; blast templates)&#10;1 blast template &mdash; 1&quot;&#10;1 blast template &mdash; 1.5&quot;&#10;1 blast template &mdash; 2&quot;&#10;1 blast template &mdash; 3&quot;&#10;2 vortex templates &mdash; 1.5&quot;&#10;1 hand flamer template&#10;1 flamer template&#10;1 heavy flamer template&#10;&#10;"

The cards quickly cycle back into the players' hands, with most of the game spent holding 4 cards.&#10;&#10;The timing of card effects is based on the orientation of the cards, using markings on them to determine the order in which they take effect. Every card has 2 options for how it can be played, with changes to the effect of the card alongside the change in timing. Matches play out fast, because it can potentially only take 2 hits to land a &quot;clean cut&quot; and achieve victory.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

You possess authentic weapons and technology in a thrilling fog of war where every decicion you take may be your last. &#10;A system of rotatable discs defines your encounters with the enemy by storing all the data and reactions.&#10;&#10;You fight to stay alive and to fulfill your secret missions. A 63 cm long wooden U-boat is used to store wooden torpedoes and fuel during the game. The deck&rsquo;s gun ammo is represented by wooden shells of different kinds and stored in a 20-round wooden magazine. All game tokens are made of wood and engraved as well. Burnt wood sets you back in time and deep under the surface of the ocean. You can call a wolfpack to support you or dive deep to avoid attacks while risking that the pressure may crack your hull every second.&#10;&#10;You play multiple missions in every chapter and have unique targets each time. Move your ship above a overworld map and choose your path there. Fuel is used to keep on moving or follow your targets and alter the weather and daytime conditions. Support tickets allows you to refill your ammo and fuel or order combat support via radio. If you encounter enemies at the overworld map you start a combat loop which will be ended after you defeated your enemies or managed to escape. After each mission you will update your crew or even buy new technology for your submarine.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;
