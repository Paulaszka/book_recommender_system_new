Each card has one or two letters on it as well as a point value.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck or discard pile, then discards a card. When a player is able to use all of the cards in his hand (with one left for discarding) to spell words &mdash; each of which must contain at least two cards &mdash; he may go out by placing the words on the table. Each other player takes one final turn, then plays as many cards as they can in words. Each player now scores, adding the point value for cards used in words, then subtracting points for any cards remaining in hand. In addition, the player with the most words and the player with the longest word each receive 10 bonus points; in case of a tie, no one receives the bonus.

Each card of another color that this player has collected is worth 1 point.&#10;&#10;To play out the hand, the active player leads a card, then each other player in clockwise order plays one card. If all cards are of the same color, then whoever played the highest card collects these cards, then leads the next trick; if all cards are not of the same color, then whoever played the highest card of a color not initially led collects these cards, then leads the next trick. (One exception: A zero card can never win a trick.) In effect, each color played in a particular trick that doesn't match the color of the card led is considered a trump card, and the highest trump wins. In the event of a tie, the earlier played card breaks the tie.&#10;&#10;Play as many hands as the number of players in the game, summing each player's points over those hands to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Sticheln allow for play with up to six players, while the third and fourth German editions of the game include enough cards to allow for play with up to eight players.

You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.

Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.&#10;&#10;&#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that &quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn.

Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.&#10;&#10;The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.&#10;&#10;Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.&#10;&#10;Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.&#10;&#10;Hands end when a player or partnership &quot;goes out.&quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.&#10;&#10;The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.

Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards &amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse. Points are awarded to 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd home, and one of your bets is a doubler.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented as:&#10;&#10;    Winner&#039;s Circle / Royal Turf &#10;&#10;&#10;"

The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).&#10;&#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).&#10;&#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.&#10;&#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.&#10;&#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.   In addition, several other tracks are available - there are two course collections which can be purchased separately and a third (web-published) collection.&#10;&#10;"

392,,"From the Cheapass Games web site: (6 November 2011)&#10;&#10;History: In 1999, James Ernest refined his notion of Real Time card games. Building on his first real time card game, Falling, which was multi-player with a dealer, he created Brawl, a two-player card game with no dealer.&#10;&#10;Summary: Brawl is a lightning-fast combat game where two players burn through their 35-card decks in about 35 seconds. Each deck contains a unique mix of cards, and each deck requires a slightly different playing style to win.&#10;&#10;Mechanics: Each player takes one deck, sets a &quot;base&quot; card on the table, and begins to play. Players play their cards (Hit, Block, Clear, etc.) as fast as they like, trying to win each Base by playing more Hits on their own side. At the bottom of both decks are three Freeze cards. When every base is Frozen, the game is over.&#10;&#10;"

394,,"&quot;Who will rule the South Seas? Two Kahuna - ancient sorcerers of the Pacific - compete for dominance on an archipelago consisting of twelve small islands. Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna &ndash; part of its Kosmos two-player series &ndash; is the best known implementation of this design.&#10;&#10;It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.&#10;&#10;The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.&#10;&#10;Reimplements:&#10;&#10;     Arabana-Ikibiti&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;     Kanaloa&#10;&#10;&#10;"

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;A Fantasy themed miniatures wargame without the miniatures.  Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.&#10;&#10;Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.&#10;&#10;Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.&#10;&#10;The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.  The  victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.&#10;&#10;"

Each player is assigned one of seven different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers. Abilities are used to acquire three different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.

To win, players must gain the support of important lobby groups within the government, hold key locations on Thunder's Edge by military force, and fight for control of vital off-world locations.&#10;&#10;from review by Nickjost:&#10;Play begins by setting up the board. The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.&#10;&#10;There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in &quot;transit&quot; are moved to &quot;orbit&quot;. Units in &quot;orbit&quot; can be deployed to the board.

There are six &#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Al Capone  A description of this version:&#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&#10;&#10;Other versions/re-themes:&#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme.

433,,"Shark is a stock-trading game slightly reminiscent of Acquire in that abstract play on the game board determines the share values of the various companies.  The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.&#10;&#10;At the start of your turn, you can buy shares (up to five) and sell shares (as many as you want), then you roll dice to determine which of the four company markers you place on the board and in which region. A company marker on its own doesn't contribute to the value of a company; only groups of at least two markers count, so groups of 5, 4, 1, and 1 markers would create a value of $9,000 for each of that company's shares. If you place a marker that combines those two lone markers, then you'd have groups of 5, 4, and 3, so the share price would shoot to $12,000. If you placed that marker on its own, the share price wouldn't change. When you place a marker, you gain money equal to that company's new share price, so you have an incentive to boost a company's size &mdash; but all players receive funds equal to the difference between the old share price and new for each share they hold, so are you enriching them more than yourself?&#10;&#10;Of course, you can also place a marker to tank a company's share price. When a company's group expands to touch a smaller group, that smaller group is removed from the board, lowering the value of that company's shares (as long as the group had at least two markers) and costing everyone money equal to the loss in value. (Groups of equal size cannot touch, and you cannot place a marker to force a smaller group to touch a larger one.) To end your turn, you can again sell as many shares as you want and buy shares up to the per-turn limit of five.&#10;&#10;Removed markers are banished from the game, not returned to the supply. Once all of a company's markers have been used, or a company's share price reaches $15,000, or all of the shares have been sold, the game ends, and players cash out all their shares to see who has the most money.&#10;&#10;"

443,,"The clever little game Code 777 combines the elements of a good, logical deduction game and Indian poker. Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, &quot;Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?&quot; which should help the others determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure of which tiles you have in front of you, you can take a guess &mdash; but if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles ...&#10;&#10;Code 777 was explicitly inspired by What's That on My Head?, and Alex Randolph credited Robert Abbott with co-designing this game based on that inspiration.&#10;&#10;In 2010, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, adding both a fifth player to the game and symbols to make it colorblind-friendly. In 2015, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 30th Anniversary Limited Edition, which is the final edition from Stronghold Games.&#10;&#10;In 2015 DiceTree Games released a multi-lingual edition of the game.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    What's That on My Head?&#10;    Egghead&#10;    Figure It&#10;    Amnesia&#10;    Guess What I Am!&#10;    Coyote&#10;    Pow Wow&#10;    Am I a Banana?&#10;    What's That on My Head?&#10;&#10;&#10;"

445,,"A simple game. Race to the end of a path. On your turn, you must move one figure and place as many rocks in the heads of other figures as the number of spaces you moved. Of the first two finishers, the one with the most rocks in his head wins.&#10;&#10;The pieces are big honking Moai (Easter Island Statues) heads made of plastic which are hollow. The game is short and simple. There is not a huge amount of strategy and it helps if the other players cannot remember how many rocks are in the others heads.&#10;&#10;"

449,,"This is a light game -- lighter than air, one might even say -- in which each player starts the game with a card assigning a secret interest in three different balloons.  The balloon markers are lovely little brightly colored plastic gadgets, and on your turn you roll a die and choose which of the eight you want to move.  Some spots you land on give you a free roll; from some you can only go backwards.  With much shucking and jiving the balloons gradually float and bump up toward the finish line whilst players feign disinterest in their own colors in hopes they'll be promoted by others.  When all three of your balloons reach the finish, you can claim victory.&#10;&#10;"

451,,"Translated as Cutpurse, this is a fairly unique entry in the trick-taking genre.  Three of the suits are relatively normal, however, the cards that are worth points, in the form of gold coins, have the least value.  The special thing about this game is the trump suit, which could have the Assassin killing the King or the Adventurer seducing the Countess; the character interaction is very interesting aspect.&#10;&#10;"

454,,"Tante Tarantel (Auntie Tarantula) scoots round her web, gobbling up your insects as they try to escape. The web is a spiral.  You roll the die to move Auntie, and then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood; if she runs into bugs, they go back to her larder. However, as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track.  Each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up the track, adding to the die roll and making Auntie run around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but often bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs can push others into Auntie's path to certain death!&#10;&#10;The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&amp;F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which add to the game's style.&#10;&#10;"

457,,"The goal of Jumbo Grand Prix is to create strong race cars that score the most racing points.&#10;&#10;Every player starts with 4 cards. In the next 4 rounds they try to build a competitive race car by changing their cards. A race car consists of a coach-work card, a tire card, an engine card, and a driver card. After 4 rounds, all the players show their race car for that race. The strength is the sum of the 4 played cards. The stronger the combination, the higher your finish place. In case of a tie, the value of the driver decides. Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race. When your coach-work, tires, and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value. Then you add the value of the driver. When your driver is also of the same value, the total combination is worth 28 points.&#10;&#10;When it's your turn, you can choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     1. Discard 1 of your cards (face up) and draw 2 new ones. The new cards can be drawn from the visible cards or from the closed pile. The 4 open piles are sorted by type. &#10;     2. Keep all your cards and draw 1 new card (from an open or the closed pile). &#10;&#10;&#10;So every turn you get 1 extra card. After 4 turns you have 8 cards, from which you must build your race car. The other 4 cards are used in the next round. Whenever you draw a card from one of the open piles, it is always the top one. From the type you just handed in, you cannot draw a new one from that type's open pile. At the start of each round, as many scoring cards are revealed as there are players. The winner gets the highest card and so on. Every player receives points, unless you cannot take part in the race. As soon as all scoring cards are used, the racing season is over. The player with the highest total of scoring cards wins the season (and the game).&#10;&#10;"
