The aim of the game is to help a struggling hotel stay open by dispelling spectres from the hotel and finally cleansing it.&#10;&#10;Overview&#10;To win, all players must expel spectres and cleanse every room in the hotel. There are 7 rounds to reach this goal. Each round different types of spectres will manifest the hotel at night and terrify guests.

The heroes can add items and treasures to these decks to power up their abilities throughout the game.  The players will then play these cards to perform actions during the different phases of the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of Level 4, the heroes will face the all-powerful Ganon in a final showdown to determine whether they save Hyrule and win the game, or whether Hyrule will be plunged into an era of darkness under the rule of a new dark lord...&#10;&#10;"

There are no Confederates closer than Corinth.&rdquo; - William Tecumseh Sherman to Jesse Appler of the 53rd Ohio, April 5&#10;&#10;On April 5, 1862 the Confederacy appeared to be finished. Forts Henry and Donelson had fallen and a Confederate division had been routed at Mill Springs. The Rebels had lost Columbus, Clarksville, and Nashville. New Orleans and Memphis were under direct threat. Out west the invasion of New Mexico had failed and the Union had triumphed at Pea Ridge. Forts and ports along the seaboard were being captured or raided. In Virginia, George McClellan had at last started his great drive to capture Richmond. On the banks of the Tennessee River a complacent Union army rested and waited for reinforcements before beginning what some thought would be the final push to end the rebellion.&#10;&#10;On the morning of April 6 the Confederates attacked that complacent army near Shiloh Church. For two days the biggest battle yet waged by Americans was fought, a battle as large and savage as anything fought by Napoleon. In the end the Union triumphed, but at heavy cost. Ulysses S. Grant was for a time sidelined and Union generals became cautious for months after. Most of all, Shiloh changed the Civil War. Combined with Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s successful defense of Richmond, Shiloh killed the vain dream of a quick war with conservative ends. The American Civil War became a long contest of wills, ending in the destruction of slavery and economic ruin for the American South.&#10;&#10;Rally 'Round the Flag! is a brigade grand tactical system that combines old school hex and counter maneuvers with rules for command and control, leader personalities, and a CRT that favors quality and firepower over raw mass. For Shiloh the series will feature rules for the 47th Tennessee, Lew Wallace&rsquo;s variable arrival, and Union gunboats among other things. The game comes with multiple scenarios, including a better Confederate attack plan, the battle starting on April 5, and the second day of battle. In addition, rules are included to modify each scenario with a variable arrival for Don Carlos Buell&rsquo;s Army of the Ohio and part of the Fort Donelson garrison escaping and taking part in the battle. For those wanted to be even more adventurous, units are included from Earl Van Dorn&rsquo;s Army of the West, and the brigades involved in the siege of Island No. 10.&#10;&#10;"

The bid card is multi-purpose and also acts as an upper limit to your star card score.&#10;&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#188;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#231;&#144;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#229;&#189;&#188;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#226;&#152;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;5&#230;&#172;&#161;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#145;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#231;&#173;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#189;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#226;&#152;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#233;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#135;&#227;&#131;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#132;&#166;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;4&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#132;&#170;&#229;&#133;&#136;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#228;&#189;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#229;&#140;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#162;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;"

Sometimes the rhymes are silly and the songs are weird - sometimes it all comes together, and sounds like you're ready for the studio.&#10;&#10;You perform your cleverly crafted masterpiece in rounds, with each rapper leading for a verse, and the rest following.

This is a system designed for balanced, small-scale tactical games that can be played quickly and easily by anyone, but which even experienced players will find challenging to master. The game rules are designed with competitive play in mind; matches can be played in under 45 minutes, on a smaller surface than our larger-scale games, and will be ideal for club or tournament play. And not only that, we&rsquo;ll be fully supporting an organized play system for this game, right from day one.&#10;&#10;The forces you can use in this game will be drawn from races across the Mortal Realms, including some for factions that have not received any new miniatures since we first ventured into the Age of Sigmar. Each of these sets will be composed of a small band of easy-to-assemble, push-fit miniatures in the style of our single-pose heroes to represent a specific band of warriors from that faction. These are provided in coloured plastic, and clip together, so you can quite literally be playing with them within minutes of opening the box with no glue or paint needed! (Though they do look great painted, and your dice will roll better &ndash; probably.)&#10;&#10;The game is played using unique dice and card decks, and these will, to an extent, be unique to each faction. Both decks of cards used in the game are fully customisable &ndash; meaning you can choose to create all manner of combinations of overlapping abilities to use and objectives to achieve. This can be a really rewarding part of the game &ndash; and means that even the same faction can be played in wildly different ways.

224634,,"Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;Monkey Wrench 2nd Edition:&#10;&#10;Your company is firing employees; Can you get rid of the bad employee in time?&#10;&#10;Monkey Wrench&#10;&#10;Is a social deduction and manipulation game requiring a minimum of 7 people to play, (6 &quot;Employees&quot; &amp; 1 Narrator). The concept of the game is rather simple. The company you work for, has suddenly been having problems with all of its production machines being sabotaged by an unknown person After hours. The Security footage shows that One of your fellow employees, (players) has been seen tampering with the machines, &quot;After Hours&quot;. The problem is, the security system couldn't detect who it was. Worse, every employee has an alibi, and no one is willing to step forward with any information of evidence.&#10;&#10;There for, the Board of Directors, (The Narrator(s)), have decided that one employee will be fired during each &quot;Day Shift&quot; via a 60% majority Employee vote, until the machines are no longer being tampered with each night. To help facilitate this, members of the local law enforcement (Undercover Cop) and the FBI (in larger games of over 15 players), as well as other law enforcement agencies (NSA 20 player game, CIA 25 player game ) to help catch the potential criminals involved. They are also working diligently around the clock to help your company find the culprit. Meeting in secret &quot;After hours&quot; to arrest potential suspects, while also masquerading as a regular employee. Their goal, is to help weed out the real problem person; The elusive The Monkey Wrench and their crew of saboteurs.&#10;&#10;However, the members of the Monkey Wrench team have an edge: &#10;Once per &quot;After hours&quot; phase, they can secretly convert one of the other employee towards their goal. If they manage to convert a casual non titled &quot;Employee&quot;, that person becomes a leader within their team, and will be given a &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; card to show their loyalty. Additionally, depending on the size of the &quot;company (game), other criminal elements can also be expected to try to infiltrate the entire organization. Everything from a simple, &quot;Lunch Thief&quot;, to a &quot;Cat Burglar&quot;, to even members of a Cult, as well as various types of &quot;Hackers&quot;, Espionage experts and even a Corporate embezzler. Each with their own &quot;After hours&quot; abilities that can be used by the Monkey Wrench team, IF they can figure out who within the company is what. Which keeps the members of Law enforcement busy during the game, and helps ensure that the Monkey Wrench team will over throw the company.&#10;&#10;Fortunately; the Law enforcement team, (Security guard, Undercover cop, FBI, CIA, NSA.. etc..), do have a extra tools in their wheel house to counter this influx of added trouble. For starters at the end of every &quot;After hours&quot; phase, the company &quot;Security Guard&quot; has the ability to The &quot;sense&quot; when another Employee can been involved with an illicit activity that evening. While the Undercover cop, once per After hours round can &quot;Arrest&quot; a single potential suspect. That player is then removed from game the next subsequent &quot;Day shift&quot;. While the FBI agent, has the power to literally &quot;Fire&quot; anyone one person in the company. Either as a secret executive action during the &quot;After hours&quot; round, or by revealing themselves to the other players as a member of law Enforcement. Upon which they can then have executive power to remove the undercover CEO, or members of upper management and even overthrow their power position within the game. While the NSA has the power to make various &quot;hacking' actions, while the CIA player, has the ability to be a spy in any group, and never reveal themselves, unless they want to. Each member of Law Enforcement, are thus granted unique abilities to help them thwart the dastardly goals of the criminal elements in game. However, in turn, each has their own requirements that they must fulfill in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;However; the rest of the employees, and neutral parties can also use their individual abilities, as well as their natural powers of social deduction, interaction, and situational perceptions to determine who they should &quot;vote&quot; against during the &quot;Day shift&quot; round. That way they can work together to have 1 of their fellow employees (Players), removed from game as a group in hopes to help the Law Enforcement players remove threats from the game, and win by power of democratic unity.&#10;&#10;So its up to you fellow employee&hellip;&#10;&#10;Will you side with the Monkey Wrench and take down the company? &#10;Will you help the Corporate Security to weed out the problem person? &#10;Or... are you secretly the Monkey Wrench, all along? Manipulating everyone to help you shut down the company.&#10;&#10;General game play:&#10;Each player is given 4 cards at the beginning of the game:&#10;&#10;1 - &quot;Day shift&quot; card, which denotes their public role within the company, that every other player is completely aware of. This card reflects that players normal operations within the company during the day, while they are working. It further operates as  each players &quot;titled&quot; position within a standard normal office environment. Each titled position, is sometimes granted certain abilities, that are usually made public to all players in play, during the &quot;Day shift&quot; phase.&#10;&#10;1 - &quot;After hours&quot; card. which designates the given players roles, duties and Private activities when they are not at work, during the &quot;After hours&quot; phase of the game. During this phase of game play, some players are lumber into various secret shadow groups, that operate in secret. Some of them are trying to resolve the crime within the company. Others are trying to ruin the company, by either overthrowing it (Such as the Monkey Wrench), or corrupting the internal operations of the company. While others yet still, have absolutely little value, or influence upon the companies operations, and function as nothing more than benign red herrings, to offset the various groups investigations.&#10;&#10;1 - &quot;Vote/ Fire&quot; card. This Operates as each individual players ability to either support another players choice of someone that they believe should be removed from play, (The &quot;Vote&quot; side of the card), by holding the card up above their head, showing that they cast a vote in support of the accuser against the one person they believe should be removed from game. Or on their &quot;Current player&quot; turn (When they have the &quot;Current player&quot; puck in hand), they may select one player in the room to be &quot;Fired&quot; from game, by pointing the card at the person they suspect is guilty, or should be removed from game. If they manage to gain a 65% majority supporting vote from the other remaining players in the game, the selected person is removed from game, revealing their &quot;After hours&quot; card(s). They then regardless of how the vote ended, had the card off to the next player to their Left.&#10;&#10;1 - &quot;Gestures&quot; card. This card is a reference card of common hand gestures used during the &quot;After hours&quot; phase of the game. This helps players know what other players in the group they are part of are saying to them, and allows them to communicate in a sort of crude sign language with each other and the Narrators.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Average game time: &#10;15 minutes for a 7 to 10 person game&#10;30 minutes for a 10 to 15 person game&#10;45 minutes for a 15 to 20 person game&#10;60 minutes for a 20 to 30 person gameIntended age of play:&#10;This game is intended for persons 16 years or older. However, the production website says &quot;18&quot;, only because the options, are 12 or 18. The content that is questionable, within the game, is sexually suggestive adult humor, found within 4 &quot;After hours&quot; cards. Which are not essential for general game play, and may be removed as needed for smaller games, of less than 25 persons playing, if persons playing the game are not age appropriate for the setting.&#10;&#10;Number of players:&#10;A basic game consists of at least 7 to 10 players:&#10;Advanced games can handle 11 to 33 players.&#10;&#10;Please note, however that for every 10 &quot;Employee&quot; players in the game, 1 &quot;Board member&quot; (Narrator), will be needed, as this will help the Narrator's to be able to manage remembering who is what position, has been fired, or changed roles within the game. A &quot;Employee Roster&quot; is provided within the game to help facilitate this, however larger games can get very confusing quickly, and to accommodate this, it's strongly advised to use 1 additional Narrator per 10 players.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;1 - 60 second timer &#10;1 - 120 second timer &#10;1 - pencil &#10;1 - &quot;Employee Roster&quot; score pad (Player role tracker) &#10;1 - &quot;Current player&quot; card &#10;30 - &quot;Hand gesture&quot; reference cards &#10;30 - &quot;Voting/ &quot;Fire&quot; cards &#10;8 - Special effect cards (Used to reflect game modifiers, such as &quot;Lunch Thief&quot;, Hacks, or other rule modifiers) &#10;37 - &quot;Day Shift&quot; - Character employment cards (These roles, Everyone in play will know about)&#10;93 - &quot;After hours&quot; split between different &quot;Hobbies&quot;, &quot;Scandals&quot;, &quot;Skill's&quot;, &amp; &quot;Moonlighting&quot; jobs. &#10;1 - 40 page &quot;Employee's Manuel&quot; (Rule book) &#10;1 - 32 page &quot;Occupational Directory&quot; (Card Description book)&#10;1 - Deluxe sized box.

Actual data of 229 countries and territories - wrapped in 10 games of action and strategy.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game comes with 229 cards containing data about various countries. The rulebook contains rules for 10 different games which can be played with the included cards.&#10;&#10;1) GeoMundi (2+ players)&#10;This is essentially War. One player chooses a category on the cards (like Literacy). All players compare the value on their card. The player with the best value collects all the cards.&#10;&#10;2) GeoMundi Double (2 players)&#10;This is played like GeoMundi, but both players choose a category. One player must win both categories to win the cards. If neither player wins both categories, each draws a new card and chooses a new category. This repeats until a player wins both selected categories and that player then wins all the cards used up to that point.&#10;&#10;3) GeoMundi Open (2+ players)&#10;Played like GeoMundi but the lead player selects any of their cards and then chooses any category. Each player may then select any of their cards to use in the battle. Best value in the category wins the cards.&#10;&#10;4) Handicap (4+ players on 2+ teams)&#10;Teams take turns. One player on one team picks a card and then must give clues so that their team can guess the name of the country. The clue provider may not use any of the words on the card or give clues related to the country name, although rhymes are allowed.&#10;&#10;5) Touch! (2+ players)&#10;This game is similar to Slap Jack. Each player turns over a card on their turn. If two consecutively played cards are for countries which neighbor each other the first player to yell &quot;Touch&quot; wins all the cards in the pile. Islands are &quot;wild&quot; and are considered to touch all other countries.&#10;&#10;6) Clue-in (2+ players)&#10;Players decide on an order for the card categories to be used. Players take turns as the clue giver. That player reads the data on the card in the order decided upon. The first player to correctly guess the country name wins the card. Each player is only allowed one guess during each round and if they guess incorrectly the clue giver gets a random card from their stack.&#10;&#10;7) Flag Wizz (2+ players)&#10;This is played like Clue-in but only the flag is given as a clue.&#10;&#10;8) The Capitals Game (2+ players)&#10;This is played like Clue-in but the players must guess the country's capital city. Or the players can only use the capital city as the clue and the players must guess the country name.&#10;&#10;9) Take Your Pick (2+ players)&#10;This is played like Clue-in but the clue giver draws two cards, states the name of each country, and chooses a category. The players must guess which country has the better value or if they match.&#10;&#10;10) Map-it&#10;This is played like Clue-in. The clue giver states the name of the country and the first player to find the country on the included map and state the country number wins the card.&#10;&#10;"

Armed with only your wits and a list of antidote ingredients, you must battle the wilds, monsters, and your fellow players to be the first to return to the apothecary with the items you need.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&bull; 1 Game Board&#10;&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Pawns&#10;&bull; 6 Wooden Colored Breath Trackers&#10;&bull; 6 Sets of 10 Ingredient Cards (60 total)&#10;&bull; 50 Monster Cards&#10;&bull; 18 Meddling Cards&#10;&bull; 10 Loot Cards&#10;&bull; 8 Drop Cards&#10;&bull; 1 10-Sided Battle Die&#10;&bull; 1 6-Sided Movement Die&#10;&bull; 1 Wooden Debris Token&#10;&#10;Preparing the Game:&#10;Each player selects a colored pawn, the corresponding breath-tracker token, and the corresponding deck of ten Ingredient Cards. Players place their pawns on the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut in the center of the board and place their breath-tracker tokens on the number 50 on the breath tracker.&#10;&#10;Next, players shuffle their ten Ingredient Cards and randomly select four ingredients. These will represent the ingredients they will need to collect for their unique antidotes. Players will place their four Ingredient Cards on the table in front of them face-up with the black vial at the top. Each player&rsquo;s remaining six Ingredient Cards can be returned to the box.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt Meddling cards based on the number of players:&#10;&bull; In a game with two players, five Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.&#10;&bull; In a game with three players, four Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.&#10;&bull; In a game with four or more players, three Meddling Cards are distributed to each player.&#10;Meddling Cards are dealt face-down and go into the player&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;Rules &amp; Gameplay:&#10;Health:&#10;Each player starts with 50 &ldquo;breaths.&rdquo; Every time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die or a 10-sided battle die, he/she loses a breath and gets one step closer to expiring. All players&rsquo; breaths are tracked around the edges of the board on the breath tracker grid. If any player is reduced to zero breaths, that player expires and is out of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tip: Select one player at the start of the game to manage the breath tracker.&#10;         Note: Even with bonuses, no player may have more than 50 breaths at any point during the game.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Movement:&#10;Each player will start his/her turn rolling the 6-sided movement die to determine how many spaces to move on the board. That player may choose any path and may move spaces forward and/or backward in any direction, even in the same turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Remember: Each time a player rolls the 6-sided movement die, he/she loses a breath on the breath tracker!&#10;&#10;&#10;Fighting a Monster:&#10;A Monster fight is triggered when a player approaches a Monster Deck and lands on a red space leading to the Monster Deck. However, if a player lands on a red space while traveling away from a Monster Deck, no Monster fight is triggered. In other words, if traveling in the same direction as the red arrow is pointing, you enter combat; if traveling in the opposite direction of the arrow, no combat is triggered.&#10;&#10;When a Monster fight is triggered, a player flips the top card of the Monster Deck and must defeat the revealed Monster before moving on&hellip; or die trying. Players may also retreat and reverse direction if they have any movements left from their movement roll.&#10;&#10;The Monster&rsquo;s level is listed at the top of the Monster Card.&#10;&#10;To defeat the Monster, a player must roll the 10-sided battle die and get a number that is equal to or higher than the Monster&rsquo;s level. The player rolls until the Monster is defeated or until he/she decides to retreat. Once a Monster is defeated, it is put in a discard pile on the table.&#10;&#10;Bonuses &amp; Drops:&#10;Some high-level Monsters, though difficult to beat, may offer helpful bonuses or valuable drop items that can greatly assist a player. Bonuses and drops are listed at the bottom of high-level Monster&rsquo;s cards. Some drops benefit the player for the remainder of the game while others are used once and then discarded.&#10;&#10;Meddling:&#10;Meddling Cards can be used at any point during the game to hinder fellow players from advancing. Meddling Cards can also be traded in at any time to regain five breaths on the breath tracker. Once a Meddling Card is used or traded in, it is discarded from the game.&#10;&#10;Collecting Loot and Ingredients:&#10;To collect an ingredient, a player must land on the corresponding starred green space on the board. Once an ingredient is collected, the player flips his/her corresponding Ingredient Card.&#10;&#10;To collect loot, a player must land on the starred yellow space that abuts it. If a player gets a Loot Card, it is added to his/her hand and may be used at any time. Like drops, Some Loot Cards give players temporary abilities while others award advantages.&#10;&#10;Dueling:&#10;During a player&rsquo;s turn, if he/she ever occupies the same space as another player, then he/she may challenge that player to a duel. A player can only challenge another player to a duel when that other player has an ingredient that the challenger still needs.&#10;&#10;During the duel, each player rolls the 10-sided battle die. Whoever has the highest roll wins, and in case of a tie, the advantage goes to the challenged player. If the challenger wins the duel, he/she takes the needed ingredient item from the challenged player, who now has to either go back and get the ingredient again or give chase to get it back. If the challenged player wins, then the challenger automatically loses 5 breaths and cannot duel that player again this turn.&#10;&#10;Note: Players may use any applicable Drop Cards or Loot Cards during their duels.&#10;Looting:&#10;If a player runs out of breath, his/her pawn is left on the spot of expiration. Each other player may loot the body if they ever occupy the same space as the expired player&rsquo;s pawn. A player may only loot an expired pawn once per turn and only for needed ingredient items or unused or perpetual drop or Loot Cards.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game:&#10;The first player to return to the Apothecary&rsquo;s hut center of the board with all of the necessary ingredients for his/her antidote is victorious! Sometimes, though, all players expire and the game wins!&#10;&#10;"

Wielding a deadly weapon and pure &#3;elemental energy, each Hero brings his own &#3;unique abilities to bear on one of the monster&rsquo;s &#3;vulnerabilities while distinguishing themselves &#3;from the other Heroes.&#10;&#10;As Heroes unleash their spectacular attacks, the &#3;people of the City marvel from across the river. &#3;After the battle, Heroes burnish their reputation--and increase their silver--by visiting &#3;among the people to increase their renown. &#3;After all, real Glory comes from the adoration &#3;of the people!&#10;&#10;Between the unpredictable attacks, Heroes &#3;have downtime to visit the bustle of the City &#3;and buy new weapons, learn new abilities, and &#3;replenish their elemental energies in &#3;preparation for battle.&#10;&#10;The Soothseers foretell that the Heroes will &#3;vanquish the Colossus after five grueling &#3;battles. Though all contribute, only the Hero &#3;with the most Glory in both deeds and renown &#3;can take credit for the Deathblow and be &#3;declared Savior of the City!&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Colossal Deathblow is a rules-light, Euro-style, majority control game with unique placement eligibility mechanisms. There are three main phases in each of the its five rounds.&#10;&#10;First, while preparing for the Colossus attack during each round (and while the outcome of each battle is still uncertain), players must make hard choices about which of the majority-control areas on the board they might want to use in a later phase.&#10;&#10;Second, during the attack, players secretly choose which vulnerability of the Colossus to target using one of their weapons, and which type and how much elemental energy to use to boost the damage. Players are then ranked according to the amount of overall damage they do to the Colossus. The player who does the most damage goes first during the next phase, but also becomes a target when the Colossus strikes back.&#10;&#10;Finally, after the battle, players must decide where to place popularity tokens from their limited supply, subject to their eligibility decided earlier. Tokens represent renown, which is converted to VPs (Glory) via majority control at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;While players can choose to place as many or as few tokens as they wish during a round, choices are final and there is a hard limit to the number of tokens they can place over the course of the game. Deciding when to double-down to gain a majority and when to conserve tokens are major considerations during each round.&#10;&#10;The game is medium-weight and plays in 75-120 minutes, and (despite the impression the name might give) has minimal direct player interaction. It thematically combines the deliciously agonizing choices of classic area control and hand management games (El Grande, Auction 2002) with resource management and simultaneous action selection mechanisms.&#10;&#10;"

But these aren't your normal Trolls, that would be boring.&#10;&#10;There are two types of Trolls, Ug Trolls which aren't all that smart and would rather smash the bridge and create holes to avoid than get into any kind of friendly small talk. Then there are their smarter counterparts, the Tollosophers which want to chit chat and you have to answer their questions to pass.&#10;&#10;Along the way you can collect Treasure that can help you fight Ug Trolls, hinder your opponents, patch the bridge, and even swap Ug Trolls for Trollosophers and many other interesting and sometimes useful things.&#10;&#10;Just make sure not to die along the way.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving their messengers along the bridge one space at a time. Each space reveals a tile that indicates if they fight an Ug Troll, a Trollosopher, or if they have found some treasure and possibly nothing, which grants an extra move.&#10;&#10;Players must navigate around holes in the bridge created by Ug Trolls. They can risk death by jumping over a hole and hoping they don't fall through the rickety bridge on the other side. In some cases this may make sections unpassable and players will have to go around those sections.&#10;&#10;Defeating the Ug Trolls is determined by dice roll to damage the Ug Trolls.  Each turn the Ug Troll remains, the player cannot advance and he knocks out sections of bridge. Defeating a Trollosopher is done by successfully answering their trivia questions. While they remain, they just keep a player from advancing.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player successfully reaches the end of the bridge. Once that happens, the game is over and the winner is determined by score. Players score points for finishing first, and for each Troll defeated as well as any treasure they have remaining.&#10;&#10;"

Within scenes, characters can activate special abilities to do things like revealing an incredibly expensive possession, providing another character with a refreshing cocktail, or fixing someone with an imperious gaze that forces them to reveal their secrets. These are all paid for with a limited pool of tokens, meaning players must carefully plan when they use their abilities to guide the story in their preferred direction.&#10;&#10;As characters make progress on their goals they accumulate special tokens they can cash in for an all-or-nothing attempt to complete the goal.

All the stones are interconnected and constantly depend on each other. During the game, the position passes through various metamorphoses and, having exhausted all its energy, freezes as a result. This game is inspired by the ancient philosophy of the Far East...&#10;&#10;You can play with:&#10;&#10;16 stones - If you prefer quick tactical games. &#10;36 stones - If you like the balance of tactics and strategy. &#10;64 stones - If you have a worthy opponent and a lot of time.&#10;&#10;Average game length - 100-110 plies (with 36 stones). Strategy is more important than tactics. The first player has no advantages. The game can begin with any compact arrangement of stones. You can play with a handicap, if necessary. It is possible to eliminate draws by changing one rule. Connectedness of the position and irreversibility of the game is the basis of krona.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Each player has an allocated color, Black and White. Players alternate turns, starting with Black. The stones must all stay connected in a single group. You cannot pick up a stone to move if doing so disconnects the remaining stones, even if they would be reconnected after putting the stone into its new location. Each stone always has neighbors. Their number can be from 1 to 8. Stones are considered to be neighbors if they stand on the nearby squares. Neighbors are divided into two types - diagonal and orthogonal. The stone can be moved to any empty square, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The stone can also be moved to any empty square, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less. The game ends when one of the players has no legal moves on his turn. If his opponent also has no moves it's a draw. If he has any move, he wins the game. In this case, the winner does as many moves as he can and earns one point for each move.&#10;&#10;"

The watching crowd interacts with the gladiators in the arena by rewarding showy attacks and spilt blood with favourable cheering which may in turn be utilised to buoy up a gladiator&rsquo;s performance.&#10;&#10;Almost everything you need to play the game, including a basic area, is inluded in the deck.

It features simultaneous action selection, outlandish sci-fi weaponry, a scrolling race track with powerups, and respawns instead of player elimination.&#10;&#10;Each player is a driver in the Death Race. The primary goal for all players is to cross the finish line (or to be as close as possible to it by the time someone else does). There are a number supplementary scoring metrics involving simple accumulation and set collection. So finishing first, while important, does not guarantee the win.&#10;&#10;In each round of the game, all players simultaneously play 2 of their control cards face down. These cards &quot;program&quot; the movements of their vehicles. Cards are then simultaneously revealed, after which each player takes a turn to resolve their vehicle movement, activate powerups, and fire weapons.&#10;&#10;Death Race has 2 modes of play: a symmetrical mode in which all vehicles have 9 identical control cards, and an asymmetric mode in which each vehicle has 4 or 5 (of 9) cards that give it unique abilities.&#10;&#10;"

In each hand, one player bids to be Chimera and the other two players team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat this player. Players compete for points in several hands of play, and the winner is the player who scores the most points once the designated point score is reached by one or more players. Chimera is normally played to 400 points, although longer or shorter games may be played. Chimera for three players was previously published as Chimera by ZMAN Games.&#10;&#10;Chimera for five players plays similarly to Chimera for three players, but with additional cards and rules. One player bids to be Chimera, then chooses one other player to be their partner (the Pi Ya) through a bid system; the other three players then team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat them. Chimera for five players is normally played to 400 points.&#10;&#10;"

(&quot;Koro&quot; is the Japanese onomatopoeic word for the sound of rolling, as in &quot;Saikoro&quot; &mdash; dice rolling.)&#10;&#10;In the game, players work to complete constellations of stars and build up victory points to win. There is a pool of dice &mdash; e.g., ten dicee in a four-player game &mdash; and after the dice are rolled, each player chooses two from the pool leaving two that are shared by all players. Now each player combines the two dice they have and the two pool dice to create two pairs of dice. If a player grabbed a 1 and a 3, and the remaining pool dice are a 2 and a 5, they could make the following pairs:&#10;&#10;&#10;    a 3 and an 8 (1+2, 3+5)&#10;    a 4 and a 7 (1+3, 2+5)&#10;    a 5 and a 6 (1+5, 2+3)&#10;&#10;&#10;Using one of these pairs, the players place cubes onto the constellation cards. When a card is full, it scores for each player who has cubes on it. A round ends when a player is out of cubes or a fifth card has been completed. Players score bonus points, then the game is reset and play continues. When a player gets to 40 points, the game ends after the completion of the current round, then the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Whilst there is some luck in the game, there is choice as well. The last player to take from the pool decides which two will be the pool dice, and turn order affects outcomes, so there is plenty to consider.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#182;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#229;&#158;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#232;&#170;&#149;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#229;&#173;&#166;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#229;&#186;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#230;&#131;&#133;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#231;&#180;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#130;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#152;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;"

It is a name nicely fitting the context of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is set in a fictional &quot;black company&quot; called CHI-KU. Each player is an employee at this company and has to work hard and do many hours of overtime work every day. The players are trusted 'slave workers' all affected to a new project called 'Endless Working'. They are expected to work super hard to make it a big success!&#10;&#10;The game got popular thanks to its theme, which is a real and well-known problem in Japan.&#10;&#10;In Endless working, the players take turn in drawing cards from the deck. There are 3 kinds of cards: TASK, STOP and END.&#10;The player who can collect the most TASK cards wins the game.&#10;You start by drawing as many cards as you want, one by one. When you stop drawing you have to carry out the action on the last card you drew.&#10;&#10;TASK cards are 'safe' but change the state of your hand.&#10;STOP causes your turn to end right away and is a penalty for you or all players.&#10;END cards either ends the whole game immediately, or forces the rest of the game players to draw more cards before they can chicken out.&#10;&#10;To put the players in the right atmosphere for the game, they recommend the players to say '&#233;&#128;&#178;&#230;&#141;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;' (Let's make progress!) before drawing a new card and '&#229;&#184;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;' (I'm going back home!) when they want to stop drawing cards.&#10;&#10;"
