You are one of these superstars on a quest for wealth, and you must overcome the gravitational challenges set before you!&#10;&#10;What is really original about Gravity Superstar is the manner in which the players' pawns move: Each turn, they move one or two spaces, then they are affected by gravity, which makes them fall until they are stopped by a platform. This effect is made possible by the fact that the pawns are used lying down on the board. Thus, they move up (above their head), down (below their feet), left, or right.&#10;&#10;During its movement, a pawn can collect stars (to score points at the end of the game) or replay tokens (to take a second consecutive turn), and eject opponents' pawns from the board.&#10;&#10;"

Each nerd card has a base attack, defense, and IQ.  Extra attack and defense cards can be added to a nerd in battle, where their IQ value is the amount of extra cards they can add.  A nerd's attack and defense values can also be boosted by adding a confidence token.  Defeat 4 nerds and you win!&#10;&#10;Everyone starts the game with 2 nerd cards, 4 battle cards, and 4 random confidence tokens.  At the start of a turn, draw 1 nerd card, or 2 battle cards. Then choose to pit your nerd against an opponents' to start a battle, or simply play an action card.  If you start a nerd battle, choose the player you want to attack, and put your nerd into play.  Add battle cards to your nerd to increase their attack defense, keeping the number of cards at or under their IQ value.  At this time, a confidence token can also be added to the nerd.  If the token matches the nerd, they get a permanent +2 to attack and defense.  If it's unmatching, it's only a +1 to those values, and is discarded at the end of the battle.&#10;&#10;Then, the opponent needs to put a nerd into play to defend the attack.  If they can successfully block the attack by getting enough defense to equal or be greater than the attack, they not only don't lose, but they may be able to add enough attack cards to counter attack and defeat the attacking nerd.  They are still limited by the nerds IQ, but can also add a confidence token.  Either way, the losing nerd hides in the winners basement (an area under the play area) and gets turned sideways.  After the battle, all battle cards are discarded, but any nerds that didn't lose stay in play, face up.  Discard down to 7 battle cards, and it's the next player's turn. First player to get 4 nerds in their basement wins!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Turenne operated in the northeast of France to join the troops of the Duc de Lorraine and the Spanish with hopes of regaining control of all the fortresses acquired in Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s cause.&#10;Sensing the danger of having such a great captain against him, Mazarin entrusted the command of the armies of Flanders and Champagne to the Comte de Plessis-Praslin (meanwhile beginning secret negotiations with the other camp). Plessis-Praslin lay siege to Rethel and, despite having given his word, the governor of Rethel surrendered a few days before Turenne&rsquo;s arrival. The commander of the Frondeur army was therefore required to combat the entire Royalist army.&#10;After his defeat (which would be the last one), Turenne joined the king&rsquo;s camp in exchange for amnesty, a few titles and, most importantly, the command of the French armies. He would be a loyal servant of the king until his death on the battlefield 25 years later.&#10;&#10;&bull; The Dunes 1658 &ndash; 14 June 1658, The alliances had evolved since the end of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The Lorraine soldiers had gone over to the French camp after their duke was imprisoned by the Spanish. Mazarin convinced King Louis XIV to sign a military alliance with Cromwell who sent a strong English contingency to the continent, thereby forcing King Charles II and Princes James and Henry to join the Spanish with their meagre troops. Exiled with those loyal to him for nearly six years, Cond&eacute; was also on the side of Juan of Austria, the commander in chief of the Spanish forces.&#10;When Turenne lay siege to the fortress of Dunkirk, Juan of Austria decided to give battle right away. Cond&eacute; declared to James &ldquo;Sir, today you will see how to lose a battle&rdquo;.&#10;As a result of this French victory, the Treaty of the Pyrenees and other related agreements were signed, putting an end to the Franco-Spanish War, to some extent the Fronde, and the English Civil War .

If you &lsquo;lose it&rsquo; during the game, you lose the game.  But you will never have more fun delaying the outcome of a game.&#10;&#10;Make it a hot night to remember for you both with this game.&#10;&#10;Game contents include: 1 game board - 1 blindfold - 2 player tokens - 1 die - 3 decks of cards &ndash; 1 instruction manual.&#10;&#10;"

A geography game played on an authentic and colorfully detailed world map. Fun and educational for teens and adults.&#10;&#10;The game comes with four different categories of card (flags, general, capitals, countries).  Players roll and move their pawn on a track.  Each space on the track represents the color of card that must be answered.  In order to move again on the same turn, players must answer their trivia cards correctly.  For flag cards, players are shown a country flag with three possible answers on them.  They must choose the correct answer to move again.  General cards ask various questions related to physical or social geography.  Country cards ask players to identify what country is being referred to on the map (each country of the world has been numbered on the board).  Finally, players must identify the capital city of a specified country when they land on a country card.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the player who lands on the finish space and answers one final trivia question correctly wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is the same as for traditional chess--checkmate the opponent's King.&#10;&#10;The board (24&quot;x24&quot;, double-sided, quad-fold, custom designed) has 96 spaces and divided into 2 castles of 24 spaces each and a battlefield of 4 rows with 12 spaces each. Numerous initial board setups are possible. Up to 4 additional or new power pieces can be used. The game comes with 2 new optional pieces--Archer and Catapult--which compliment the Knight, Bishop, and Rook.&#10;&#10;All the traditional chess pieces move as they do in traditional chess. See the game rules for how the Archer and Catapult move. Castling works like it does in traditional chess only if the standard chess setup for the power pieces is used.&#10;&#10;The board has 4 triangular spaces. When a Queen or Bishop moves into a triangle across a corner, it can exit across either of the other 2 corners. When a Queen or Rook moves into a triangle across a side, it can exit across either of the other 2 sides. Thus, the pieces gain an extra path (a 5th path) of coverage when they are aligned with a triangular space, which is often a great advantage, especially in the middle and end games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publiser&#10;&#10;This entry is 'level 2' of the games contained in Castle Strife Games.  Each level is a game in its own right, but the earlier levels also serve to gradually introduce the rules of Castle Siege.  This level is the most chess-like.&#10;&#10;"

The goal is to accumulate 100 or more points by collecting &ldquo;Industry Cards.&rdquo;  Each player begins with 1 of each industry card in play (Strip Clubs, Drug Trafficking, Waste Management, Money Laundering, Gambling Ring and Law Enforcement).  Each turn begins with a &ldquo;Collect&rdquo; phase, where the player takes $200 from the &ldquo;stash.&rdquo;  Then there is a &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; phase, where they player may choose to purchase more industry cards (kept in their hand for now, but not in play) or bullets to attack with.  Next is the &ldquo;Attack&rdquo; phase, where the player can choose to roll dice to &ldquo;shoot the bullets&rdquo; at another player&rsquo;s industry cards.  If a 4+ is rolled, the player takes that card and adds it to his/her industry cards in play.  Finally, there is the &ldquo;Build&rdquo; phase, which is when a player may play one industry card that was purchased earlier.&#10;&#10;The first player to accumulate 3 of any one industry card in play, &ldquo;owns&rdquo; that industry and gains the benefits of it (for example, the person who owns the Gambling Ring gets to roll a die during his/her collect phase and collects $100 X the number they roll, in addition to the $200 they already collect).  Every time an industry is taken over, the player who now owns it gets to pull a &ldquo;Good Earner&rdquo; card, which can be saved and used at any time (for example, there is a bullet proof vest, which makes bullets only hit on 5&rsquo;s and 6&rsquo;s for one attack phase).&#10;&#10;After each round, the player with the most industry cards in play (not counting the ones purchased but not played yet) is the &ldquo;Rat.&rdquo;  They must pull a rat card, which almost always has a negative action that must be taken.  The Rat goes first in the next round, which isn&rsquo;t always a good thing.&#10;&#10;Each industry card in play is worth 5 points, but once the player owns the industry, all the cards within that industry are worth 10 points for that player.  The game ends when there are one or more players over 100 points at the end of the round (the one with the most points wins).  If someone gets over 100 points in the middle of a round, others can attack that player to reduce their points to less than 100.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
