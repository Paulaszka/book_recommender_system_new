The game has an universal approach to tabletop gaming, where almost all fantasy miniatures with a scale around 28mm can be fielded in battle. Players take on the role of two mighty warlords, who muster their troops to claim the throne and be crowned king of the Guided Lands. Doing so players will use a unique step-by-step approach to create different races and equip their soldiers with weapons, armor and special abilities, thus making nearly all of your fantasy miniatures you have lying around somewhere ready to be used as heroes or units in Guided Lands. The scale ranges from small skirmishes to epic battles including monsters, magic and powerful artillery. An easy and streamlined ruleset as well as a card-driven initiative system keeps gameplay fast, while also engaging for seasoned tabletop generals. So dust of your old miniatures and start playing!&#10;&#10;Guided Lands is the first game of the new publisher Smiling Monster Games and will be released in a limited first edition of 500 copies at Essen Spiel 2010 in German language (Hall 6, booth 6-808), estimated price &euro; 20 (softcover book).&#10;&#10;More information at www.smiling-monster.de&#10;&#10;"

Each turn is affected by an event card drawn for that day.  Each turn is divided into two phases: Day and Night.  A 90 second timer is provided with the game to provide a  fair length for both phases.&#10;&#10;During setup, survivor cards will be handed out.  One of the survivors will be Patient Zero and become a zombie at the end of the first day.  Each survivor starts with one item.  After everyone has an item, the group elects their leader.  Since no one knows anyone else's role, it is possible to elect Patient Zero as the group's leader.  Anytime the leader becomes a zombie, the survivors must elect a new leader before beginning the day phase.&#10;&#10;During the day the elected leader of the survivors draws resource cards and the survivors discuss how to divide them up.  Some of the Survivors, however, are infected and will eventually join the Zombies attacking the Survivors.  At the end of each day, players check their character cards to see if they have become a zombie.&#10;&#10;During the night, the players who have become zombies play attack cards of various types against the remaining survivors.  The survivors must work together to defend themselves using the resources they found during the day to resist and shunt off zombie attacks in order to survive.  Those who cannot stop or deflect a zombie attack, become zombies who will get a zombie attack card the next night.&#10;&#10;The game's scenario runs for one week's time, from Sunday to Saturday.  Each turn an event card shapes both the day and night phases.  Each day the survivors use their drawn resources to make a plan for resisting the zombies.  Each night the zombies attack the survivors and try to wipe them out.  The game ends after the night phase on Saturday when those still alive win by surviving the zombie apocalypse, or else when all survivors are   dead (or undead, as it were).&#10;&#10;"

They succeeded and managed to turn the tide launching their own offensive toward Damascus.&#10;&#10;Heights of Courage is the 16th game in the award winning Standard Combat Series. It complements the 1995 CSR award winning game Yom Kippur (which covers the fighting in the Sinai). It uses the same 8 page standard series rulebook applicable to all the other games.&#10;&#10;Because both sides have offensive and defensive phases of the battle to enjoy, victory is determined by comparing the best Syrian performance in their early offensive to the Israeli offensive results at the end of the game. This forces both sides to fight tooth and nail on both the offense and defense with enormous time pressure on perform rapidly.&#10;&#10;The game captures all the sizzle of the fast-paced armored battle with enough steak to give the game the appropriate level of depth. For example, it uses an innovative two tempo operational speed, to both players as the battle goes beyond the endurance of the forces involved.  Each player can select to go &ldquo;fast&rdquo; in order to fight more or &ldquo;slow&rdquo; in order to get more replacements.&#10;&#10;While Heights of Courage cannot be directly linked to Yom Kippur, the game provides rules to allow players to play both games in tandem so as to play the &ldquo;whole war.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Four scenarios allow different looks at the 17 turn campaign (turn length varies based on when a cease-fire occurs).&#10;4.1 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (17 turn long version)&#10;4.2 The Historical Battle for the Golan Heights (10 turn short version)&#10;4.3 Operation Badhr (6 turn look at the initial Syrian offensive)&#10;4.4 Operation Al-Owda (Original Syrian plan - which can be played in the 6, 10 or 17 turn versions)&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: Half day to 3 days (depending on game turn)&#10;Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers&#10;Units: Platoon/Task Force/Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 16-page Heights of Courage rulebook&#10;One 8-page Standard Combat Series ver 1.7 rulebook&#10;Two 6-sided die&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-15 hours&#10;&#10;"

On each player&rsquo;s turn they are permitted to place a token on any of these squares or corners. Players start with 25 tokens each and the game is over when both players have used all of their tokens.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to attempt to build secured structures by either placing or capturing tokens on the board. There are two types of secured structures:&#10;&#10;     Having tokens on a square and the 4 corners surrounding it&#10;     Having tokens on a corner and the 4 squares surrounding it&#10;&#10;&#10;Tokens making up a secured structure cannot be captured.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a token on an unoccupied area of the board, a player may remove one of their opponent&rsquo;s tokens and replace it with their own. This is called capturing a token. Captured&#10;tokens are removed from the game. A token may only be captured if you have a line of tokens adjacent to the token you wish to capture that is greater in length than the line of your&#10;opponent&rsquo;s adjacent tokens in the opposite direction. Thus, to capture a square you must have a line of squares and to capture a corner you must have a line of corners. Tokens that make up&#10;part of a secured structure cannot be captured, but can be used in forming lines to capture other tokens.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players have run out of tokens to place on the board. When this happens, count the number of secured structures each player has built during the game. Remember, tokens can be used in more than one secured structure. The player with the highest number of secured structures wins.&#10;&#10;If the number of secured structures is equal, then the player with the largest number of tokens on the board wins on possession (this is the same as the player who has captured the most tokens). If this number is equal then the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;(Excerpts from the instructions)&#10;&#10;"

He secretly hid it in a royal treasury hall, that no one dared to enter.That was one of the most important tasks of his life. Centuries later, an archaeologist excavated the same item the wizard had placed in the treasury hall. The archaeologist, also hid the item in a secret place called the Continuum Vault. His purpose was the same as the wizard&rsquo;s. To leave the item in the Vault, until the proper passing of the centuries, like a good wine in a cellar. In the far future, an agent that had access to the continuum vault, extracted the item she had asked from the wizard and the  archaeologist to keep safe through the centuries.&#10;&#10;THE GUILD. The Wizard was a founding member of a Wizard&rsquo;s Guild that managed the impossible. To travel without moving. Although, the moving wasn&rsquo;t through space. The Guild discovered that when you manage to travel without using the dimensions of space, you travel through time. Hence, the new name of the Guild was based on the event of that movement through time, the Total Inertia Moving Event Guild, or simply T I M E Guild. Centuries passed, the coming of the Nano Age totally reformed the Guild into a T I M E Agency and gave a new agenda to its members: The molecular processing. The Agency could combine almost anything in order to create new properties it could utilize. But, some items needed to be centuries old in order to evolve or to become suitable for the processing. Therefore, the Agency decided to cooperate with its members from times past in order to bring items to the future in their desirable state. So, there were many ways for one to do that. You could simply travel back in time instruct someone in the past, to hide an item for you in a place that you knew, and travel back in your time and take the item, which now would be centuries old. Or, you could take an item from your time and hide it somewhere in the past by yourself and take it back when you return in the future. But, the T I M E Agency has many members, so that it can function properly in all Eras. If you travel back in time, too far away from your Era, it could be hard to adjust in the ways people had in the past, so, the help of another person from that Era makes the procedure easier. Usually, a Mission that includes the keeping of an item through the centuries, is concluded by 3 members: A Wizard, an Archaeologist, and a T I M E Agent specialized in traveling through the ages.&#10;&#10;Components.&#10;1 board.&#10;4 player sheets.&#10;12 pawns (3 for each player).&#10;108 cards.&#10;1 rulebook.&#10;&#10;GAME-PLAY. &#10;All players begin the game with a mission that requires at least 4 items of different properties. Each player during his/er round uses his/er 3 pawns, which are the Wizard, the Archaeologist and the T I M E traveler. The board of the game is divided in three regions that represent three aspects of time: Past Present and Future. Each pawn starts from one of these regions and moves in order. First the Wizard can move in regions of the Past to collect information about powerful items and artifacts and then gather the items and/or artifacts for which he possesses the proper information. Then, the Archaeologist, moves in the Present regions in which he can also gather items that are somewhat different from the Past items and he can gather some more info about artifacts of the Past that might help the Wizard find them. Last, the Time Traveler moves and starts from the future areas, in which she can also gather info and items. The difference in the future region is that, items gathered here are built for time travel, which means that they evolve as the centuries pass. It is best for the Time traveler to travel back in time and leave these items in the Past or the Present to age and become stronger. Each item in Continuum Run has tiers, 3 sometimes 4. When an item is new, it begins from tier 3. Some areas on the board allow the players to store items and take them back from another time period. For example in the Present regions there is the Continuum Vault. If the Archaeologist stores an item of tier 3 in the Present it stays there until someone takes it. The Continuum Vault has its future version, in which the time traveler can go and take the item the Archaeologist has stored. But, centuries have passed, so the item must be replaced with a lower tier. Tier 2 in this case. Different tiers have different values. So, if a player requires for his/er mission an item with a value of Ruination 3, and s/he possesses a future item that has Ruination 2, s/he may store that item in one region and take it back from the next.&#10;GOAL.&#10;Any player that has at least 4 items that his/er mission requires may cause an endgame, during which, a last round is played and then players score Victory Points for each item and/or artifact they have managed to send to the Future Area called Molecular Processor.&#10;&#10;"

How will these countries mitigate the inevitable ecological catastrophes?&#10;&#10;Your goal is to build a land free of garbage and pollution &ndash; a land where the environment is as healthy as the economy. Only then can you consider your country to be truly developed.&#10;The game consists of six rounds, during which you oversee the urbanization of your country. Some lands produce income. Some produce scientific research. Others improve the quality of life. Your research allows you to discover new technologies that will shape the way your nation develops. Science can even help you avert ecological catastrophes. At the end of each round, your lands provide you the money and research that you will need to deal with the challenges of the next round.&#10;&#10;You accumulate points each round, based on your nation&rsquo;s quality of life. At the end of rounds two and four, you also score bonus points for certain aspects of your country&rsquo;s development. At the end of round six, you will score bonus points based on your country&rsquo;s income, research, and environmental quality. The player with the most points wins, having built the country with the highest standard of living.&#10;&#10;(from Czech Games Edition website)&#10;&#10;"

It involved thousands of ships, stretched over hundreds of miles of ocean, and involved hundreds of convoy battles and single-ship encounters. During the struggle advantage switched back and forth between the U-boats and Allies as new weapons, tactics, and countermeasures were developed and implemented.&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader takes the Leader series to new depths, letting players control a group of U-boats on missions in the Atlantic. The core system of the game will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to quickly get into the game.&#10;&#10;A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you concentrate your submarines in one or two areas to form wolfpacks or spread them out in the shipping lanes to increase the chances of finding contacts, or do you send them on special missions (such as mine-laying)? You can also spend Special Operations Points to support your submarines by adding search planes to help find enemy ships or by sending supply ships and subs (Milk Cows) to extend the endurance of the submarines. During longer campaigns you need to manage the U-boat patrol rotation to keep subs on station.&#10;&#10;When a patrolling U-boat comes into contact with an enemy force it can call other boats in the same patrol zone to form a wolfpack or attack alone. The action then shifts to the tactical display where the U-boats try to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to actually identify the ships.&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader includes the following type of U-boats: &#10;Type IIB/C coastal submarines &#10;Type VII A/B/C Atlantic submarines&#10;Type IX A/B/C long-range submarines&#10;Type XXI Elektro-boat&#10;&#10;U-Boat Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Battle of the Atlantic:&#10;&#10;The Battle Begins: covering operations at the start of World War II to about mid-1940.&#10;&#10;The Happy Time: covering the period from mid-1940 to mid-1941 when the U-boats and wolfpacks dominated the seas.&#10;&#10;Operation Drumbeat: covering operations off the American coast and in the Caribbean in early 1942.&#10;&#10;The Hunted: covering the time period when the tide starts to turn against the U-boats.&#10;&#10;-Dan Verssen Games&#10;&#10;Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen&#10;&#10;"

In the fall of 1942, the very experienced German army was pushing further into the Soviet Union despite the serious setback inflicted on it by the Soviet winter offensive in December 1941. The Germans were now fighting a rebuilding Soviet army composed of raw recruits and some veteran units that had survived, and learned from, the battlefield disasters suffered by the Russians in 1941.&#10;&#10;The German Sixth Army approached the outskirts of Stalingrad in September 1942 a little over two months into its summer offensive. Although his bombers had destroyed the city's industrial and transportation capacity in August, Hitler ordered the capture of Stalin's city. In Objective: Stalingrad, the German player starts with only sixteen regiments to accomplish this mission. The means to German victory is in the ground-attack Stukas and independent battalions of artillery, combat engineers, anti-aircraft (flak), and assault guns (StuGs) that can be attached to the regiments to devise the best tactical mix of forces to conquer Stalin's city.&#10;&#10;While the German regiments were steadily reduced in strength and exhausted to impotence, dozens of untested, conscript Soviet rifle regiments and brigades were obliterated in the house-to-house fighting. Cards will provide crucial influential factors such as snipers, leader initiative, mine dogs, armored trains, and river flotilla warships.&#10;&#10;In Objective: Stalingrad the German player commands up to twenty regiments of infantry, including panzer grenadier infantry, along with numerous independent units. There are four scenarios representing each of the major attacks launched by the Germans between 13 September and 11 November. There is also a multi-player campaign game. The smaller scenarios are designed to be played in three to four hours. (For a different approach, see Stalingrad: Verdun on the Volga. In VoV the German player can refight the four major historical attacks using up to nine primary maneuver units &ndash; divisions &ndash; at an operational level. The same scenario at that level can be finished in one to two hours.)&#10;&#10;Objective: Stalingrad is about tactical choices for both the German and Soviet players. If you never had time to play Dana Lombardy's tactical company-level &quot;monster&quot; game Streets of Stalingrad, OS enables you to refight one of the most important battles of World War II in far less time.&#10;&#10;"
