Its rules are the same as those of to&#196;&#159;&#196;&#177;zqumalaq, but it is played on a smaller board and with accordingly less pieces: two rows of five pits and 50 pieces (five per pit, &#208;&#177;&#208;&#181;&#209;&#129; means five).&quot;&#10;&#10;"

From http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Vai_Lung_Thlan:&#10;&#10;&quot;Vai Lung Thlan (lung &quot;stone&quot;; thlan &quot;grave&quot;; vai may mean &quot;foreign&quot; or be short for vai phei, the name of an old Kuki clan) was first described in 1912 by Lt.-Colonel J. Shakespear. This mancala game is played by both sexes of the Mizo (the modern name for the Lushai people) who live in the Indian State of Mizoram located between Myanmar and Bangladesh.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board consists of two rows of six holes.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player lifts up all the stones of one of his holes and distributes them clockwise, one by one, into the consecutive holes, first along his row and then back along that of his opponent.&#10;&#10;If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole on either side of the board, the player captures it as well as all stones which precede this hole (that is, against the direction of movement or anti-clockwise) by an unbroken chain of single stones. Captured stones are removed and placed aside by the player.&#10;&#10;No matter whether it was captured or not, the move is over after one lap.&#10;&#10;The players move alternately and passing is prohibited, unless a player has no legal move.&#10;&#10;The game is finished when no stones are left on the board. The player who has captured more stones wins. If each player has captured 30 stones, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;Suggestions for good play:&#10;&#10;The game starts slow, but accelerates as stones are captured or accumulated in a few holes and the board is cleared. The middle game should be a clever exchange of stones.&#10;&#10;A hole containing 12 stones can always capture at least one stone because the last stone is dropped into the emptied hole. On the other hand, it is impossible for holes which contain more than 12 stones to capture. These holes can be used for defence because by distributing their contents all empty holes of the board are filled. At the end of the game players try to deprive their opponent of legal moves while keeping as many stones as possible on their own side in such a way that only single stones are created when they are distributed. Therefore, overloaded holes become &quot;bad shape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Quote:&#10;&#10;Counting the stones in the hole before removing them is not allowed, and considerable skill is required to judge accurately the number of stones, so as to select a hole containing the number of stones which when distributed will leave the maximum number of holes with single stones in them. &#10;J. Shakespear&quot;&#10;&#10;Mancala World also gives an interesting endgame problem.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    igGameCenter (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The ability to play corps sized battles and larger actions with battalions as opposed to brigades was made possible due to an innovative morale and combat system that simplifies the mechanics of play while accounting for tactical nuances. It is not an exaggeration to say that Shako II can be played often without reference to the rule book or even the Quick Reference Sheet.&#10;&#10;In addition to clarifying the few points of ambiguity in the original rules, the central design concept focused on battle planning and command and control is being refined to speed play and to more accurately reflect the limits of control Napoleonic generals had over their men and the course of battle. In Shako II, careful planning, scrupulous deployment of units and attention to timing will be as important as how one moves individual units within the restrictive chaos of fighting. Bad planning and poor deployments will be punished by those players who have the Napoleonic flare for battle. En avant!&#10;&#10;"

Players sail one of the triangle courses as printed on the map; each course is used for a number of boat classes. Start and finish lines are also printed on the board.

Players roll dice to move, and they need certain die rolls to start the race, change direction or gain sailing or advantage cards. Sailing cards represent difficulties the player must cope with (so they are, in effect, &quot;disadvantage&quot; cards). Special rules apply in the immediate areas around the turn marker buoys. Otherwise, some basic yachting rules, in particular right-of-way rules, must be observed.&#10;The game is completely bi-lingual (English &amp; French, as befits the location) and comes with an &quot;Olympic Information&quot; booklet that explains the sailing events (courses and boat classes) of the XXI Olympic Games as they took place in 1976 in Kingston Bay, Ontario, Canada.

39647,,"A mancala game. From Mancala.Wikia.com:&#10;&#10;Adji-boto (&quot;pebble boat&quot;) is a mancala game which is played by the Saramaccans who live on the upper Saramacca river in Suriname. The Saramaccans are a tribe of Bush-Negroes which was formed by escaped slaves. The first field study on the game was conducted by the American ethnologue Melville J. Herskovits (1895-1963) in 1928 in the village of Beidotti. The game resembles mancala games known in Benin, West Africa.&#10;&#10;The game is used to entertain the dead during the ten-day period preceding burial in the kre wosu, or house of mourning. The play is only carried out during the daylight hours because in the night the yorkas, or ghosts of the dead, would come and play with us and eventually carry away our spirits.&#10;&#10;The boards are only carved by old widowed men because this is a serious issue. They are made in two shapes, those having straight tops, and those in which the tops are curved. A village should have both types, so that if a person was fond of one kind of board dies, the people can play for a time on the other and there will be a lessened danger of his ghost coming to play with them. Although the Bush-Negroes are fine wood-carvers the Saramacca boards are of the roughest. This is because of the sacred character of the game which is not one which can be hurried in playing. It must entail some effort and even pain  to bring it to perfection.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;Adji-boto is played on a board called adji-bangi (&quot;pebble stool&quot;) that consists of 2x5=10 holes. In addition, each player has a store called boto (&quot;boat&quot;) at his right hand.&#10;&#10;Each hole contains 10 stones called adji (&quot;pebbles&quot;) at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, except one stone that remains in the hole, one by one, in consecutive holes in an anti-clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;In the first ten moves of the game all of the ten playing holes must be played.&#10;&#10;It is only permitted to play a hole which contains at least two stones.&#10;&#10;It is not allowed to pass a move unless a player has no legal move left.&#10;&#10;If the last stone ends (kaba) in a hole which precedes another hole or a continuous chain of holes that contains one, three or five stones (including any sequential combinations), these stones are captured and put into the player's boto. It is possible to capture on either side of the board. The only exception is the opening move in which  nothing is captured. If a Bush-Negro captures he says: &quot;I eat your children!&quot; (Mi nyam yu p'kin kaba!)&#10;&#10;The game is finished when both players can't move.&#10;&#10;The remaining stones are captured by the player on whose side they are.&#10;&#10;The player who has won most stones is declared winner. It is said that  &quot;the loser is killed!&quot; (a kiri mi kaba!).&#10;&#10;If both players captured the same number of stones the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;"

It depicts the campaigns that took place during 1796-1797 and again in 1799-1800 in southern Germany, the Rhine and Danube river areas and northern Switzerland. As in Volume II, it's a two-in-one game since the first group of scenarios show the brilliant campaign of 1796 of Archduke Charles of Austria, who defeated and expelled from Germany the French Armies that had launched an invasion across the Rhine; and it also includes other scenarios centered on the Swiss-German side of the Austro-Russian offensive of 1799. They depict the Allied advance into Switzerland and the Alps and their defeat that culminated in the outstanding victory of the French troops led by Moreau at Hohenlinden.&#10;&#10;As in Volume I the game includes all the elements that characterized pre-industrial warfare. However, the player will also find some elements distinctive of this campaign, as Alpine terrain, a different map and time scale to reflect the duration of the campaign as well as special rules to play the longest campaign scenarios together with those of Volume II &quot;Eagles Rising&quot;. Given the size of the armies involved most of the scenarios of this Volume are quite adequate for two to four players since there are few headquarters and their size is quite manageable.&#10;&#10;Each game contains:&#10;- 2 80x60 cm maps (together form a 60x160 cm map of Switzerland and Southern Germany) &#10;- 8 Terrain overlays used in field battles &#10;- 2 Sets of Player Aid Sheets (3 sheets each)&#10;- 2 General Headquarters display sheets&#10;- 2 Dice (d10)&#10;- 1 Set of Army Sheets (to be photocopied) &#10;- 832 counters (4 sheets)&#10;- 1 Age of Muskets series booklet&#10;- 1 Vienna or Death Exclusive Rules booklet, scenarios, historical and designer notes&#10;&quot;Vienna or Death&quot; is more than just a game.

From the first (&quot;Mountain warfare&quot; lasting four turns) to the whole campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800.

The leather creaks and steel clangs as you gird yourself for war. Overhead, storm clouds gather and the lightning slams into the earth in great forking bolts all around you. A howling north wind scourers the lands clean in preparation for the final conflict that will decide the fate of the world.&#10;&#10;You know in your heart that of all the battles that have come before, this will be the last, and greatest. This is Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods of men and the dark forces of the night.&#10;&#10;With a wave of your massive hand you summon forth the heroes and Valkyrie that will fight at your side. The ground trembles under the footsteps of your mighty foes. There they are! On the horizon, grim giants, fell beasts, and the undead of countless battlefields approach in unending waves. Above the clatter of their weapons and armor a clear deep note pierces the sky. It is Heimdall&rsquo;s horn! He is calling forth the gods and heroes to stand fast at the rainbow Bifrost Bridge and do battle.&#10;&#10;Without hesitation, you stride forward to stand at his side with your brothers and sisters. You are an Aesir, a god and defender of humanity, and this is the time of legends!&#10;&#10;Game Play&hellip;&#10;&#10;A few years ago, we realized that the core action-reaction card mechanic of Down In Flames would also be perfect for other interactive combat situations, but we could never think of the right setting. Finally, a couple months ago, we came up with the idea of designing a game based on the Norse gods, their foes the Jotun, and the mythical battle to end all battles, Ragnarok. In this game, we&rsquo;ve given the action-reaction system a twist in that the turn sequence is interactive, so as each attack is played, the next card played is actually a counter-attack that can inflict damage. This makes for a very intense battle system where every card can both attack and defend.&#10;&#10;In this fact-paced card game, you take on the role of one of Norse mythologies greater gods such as Thor, Odin, Heimdall, or one of their Jotun enemies like Thrym, Fenrir, or Loki.&#10;&#10;Once you are girded for battle, you will hack, slash, thrust, and grapple your way to victory!&#10;&#10;Ragnarok is designed and packaged to be an economical social game.

It is a strange game, but it is very nice, and regardless the apparent simplicity of some pieces and rules, it is a very complex and deep game. The object of the game is to move TWO pieces, called TRAVELERS, to the last rank,&quot; according to information found on www.chessvariants.org.&#10;&#10;The pieces include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Travelers (T): Can move in the eight directions, up-to three positions. A Traveler can't capture pieces, neither being captured. A Traveler can't  move into Check, but if in Check, it is not obligatory that you move your Traveler. When a Traveler reaches the last rank, it can't move, neither being displaced. You win the game if your two Travelers reach the last rank.&#10;     Displacer (D): Can move as Queens. If a Displacer lands on a square orthogonally adjacent to an enemy piece, you can DISPLACE the enemy piece (except a Block) and send it to ANY EMPTY square in the vertical line or the horizontal line defined by the Displacer's landing square. A Displacer can't displace a Traveler that has reached the last rank.&#10;     Block (B): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Block can't capture, neither being captured. Block can't be displaced. A Block can't never move to the first or to the last rank.&#10;     Ace (1): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. An Ace can capture a piece at distance 1 in the eight directions, except a Traveler or a Block.&#10;     Deuce (2): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Deuce can capture a piece at distance exactly 2 in the eight directions, regardless there is or not an intermediate piece in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks.&#10;     Trey (3): Moves in the eight directions, up-to-three squares. A Trey can capture a piece at distance exactly 3 in the eight directions, regardless there are or not intermediate pieces in the path. They can't capture Travelers or Blocks. &#10;&#10;&#10;You start the games with two Travelers, one Displacer, one Block, four Aces, two Deuces and two treys.&#10;&#10;"

In this game, a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. A card shows a combination of two different colors/symbols familiar to those who know the Ingenious board game.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.&#10;&#10;As in Ingenious, players take an extra turn immediately if they max out the points available in a color, with ten being the highest number in Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel.&#10;&#10;Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.&#10;&#10;"

They shake - you quake, as you race to be the first player to collect three tips and win the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;One of the last game to be produced by Waddingtons before they were taken over by Hasbro. The game is for 2-4 players, Ages 6 and up.&#10;&#10;Each player has a coloured playing piece representing a waiter or waitress. On their turn, each player is timed using a salt pot shaker (which is effectively a timer), which is frantically shaken to make the 'salt' within it drain faster. When all of the 'salt' within it reaches the bottom, the players turn is over.&#10;&#10;During a players turn, the player may do as many of the following before their time runs out:&#10;&#10;- roll a standard six sided die and move from the kitchen to the nearest table of their colour&#10;- on arriving at a table, the player picks up a food order disc and tries to return to the kitchen&#10;- upon reaching the kitchen (which contains a spinner), the player spins the spinner until it matches the food order they have picked up. The spinner can reveal either a blank or food. If food is displayed, the food order is ready&#10;- return back from the kitchen to the table where the order was placed, and collect a money tip&#10;&#10;The first player to collect three money tips wins.&#10;&#10;The game board requires some assembly, and consists of the kitchen, the tables to be served, and narrow lanes which the players move along.&#10;&#10;As with many of the later Waddingtons games, it was firmly aimed at the younger end of the market, and as a consequence has limited replay value. Still, it is fast and frantic - players are constantly rolling dice and moving pieces, whilst another player is shaking the timer to end that players turn, egged on by any other players. The narrow lanes in the board do introduce a limited amount of strategy - you can block opposing players off - and the salt pot timer is a work of genius.&#10;&#10;"
