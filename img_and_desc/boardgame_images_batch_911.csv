Whilst overcoming challenging route sections, players need to deal with unforeseen events, manage their energy level and gear placement to avoid hitting the ground in case of a likely fall. If you top out first, you win. If you hit the ground when you fall you lose.&#10;&#10;First each player decides how much energy they will have and how much gear they want to take on the climb: you can be more risky and have more energy to allow you to climb longer stretches, but the falls also become longer and more serious, whereas having more gear allows for steady progress but you will need more breaks to recover some energy.&#10;&#10;Then players take turns deciding how to move along the route, spending energy as they go. For example, it costs no energy to climb across a ledge, but it will take a lot to surmount an overhang or a roof section. Once all energy is spent the player takes a fall. Thus one needs to place gear for protection to prevent falling to the ground (different coloured gear fit only into places with suitable colour, unless it is a bomber placement). When a player places gear, a Place card is taken and the corresponding event is resolved. Every time a player enters a new route tile a Move card is taken and a corresponding event is resolved, which may result in a fall or may replenish some of the player's energy reserves.&#10;&#10;"

Rupert's Very Bad Day relies on lots of bases and base removal so isn't very friendly with my big bases and Thirty Years War units with both pike and shot on the same base.  But I liked the simplicity, saw considerable potential, and really liked the name. So I immediately began writing a version that would suit my pike and shot for the Thirty Years War which are based on big bases (80mm x 40mm). My initial draft started very close to Matt Fritz's work, and I remain heavily indebted to him, howeverthe rules have evolved quite far from the original. The biggest similarity to the original rules is probably the name although even there &quot;Rupert&quot; became &quot;Tilly&quot;.  I have introduced more types of stand (light horse, pike+shot, rabble), single stand units (hence pike+shot), a new concept called &quot;resolve&quot; to replace stand removal, morale rules based on resolve, terrain including the option to allow infantry to &quot;defend the hill&quot;, distances based on base width, a more complex interplay of shooting and charging to reflect different national and unit attitudes to these combat options, increase purpose for commanders, optional troop quality (superior, ordinary, inferior, rabble) and hence an optional point system, and probably other things. Despite these additions, and the complexity they bring, I think the rules still allow &quot;fast play&quot;. Although I've got the Thirty Years War in mind &quot;Tilly's Very Bad Day&quot; should be applicable to the Eighty Years War and English Civil War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

For the past few centuries, the Iberian Peninsula has been a complex battlefield of crossed interests, kings' ambitions and noblemen's intrigues. The Muslim power, once uncontested under Cordoba's Caliphate banners, lies languidly in the last Moor stronghold in Al-Andalus, the marvellous city of Granada.&#10;The last rulers of the Alhambra (&ldquo;The Red One&rdquo;) have been buying peace from the powerful Christian kingdoms for decades. Weakened by internal family divisions, they now face their darkest nightmare: a nuptial union between Castille and Arag&oacute;n in the figures of Isabel I of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon, the Catholic Monarchs.&#10;Through cunning diplomacy and negotiations, large armies are congregating to push to the sea the last Muslim presence in Western Europe. The Pope promulgates the last Crusade and military orders join the mixed army of Castille and Aragon, along with mercenaries all over Europe. The Nasrid Kingdom tries to gather its men and garrisons, sending messengers to North Africa for military support and reinforcing the numerous castles and watchtowers all over its lands.&#10;But deception and treason will play their part (Ferdinand II will be the main inspiration for Machiavelli's &rdquo;The Prince&rdquo;). Boabdil is conspiring to reach the throne in the city of the pomegranates whereas his uncle, el Zagal, is well known for his hit-and-run ambushes and guerrilla warfare. Will Catholic Monarchs be able to consolidate their dream of a united Iberian realm to continue towards world-wide domination? Will the Nasrid Kingdom accept the challenge and fight in a stubborn resistance until it breaks its enemies' will to continue the fight?&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES&#10;Granada: The Last Stand of the Moors, is a game for two players in which they will decide the outcome of this decisive historical episode in less than 4 hours.&#10;Units are represented by blocks depicting their strength but also their origin: Castilians, Aragoneses, Leoneses and mercenaries for the Catholic player, and different clans like Banu Sarray, Zegr&iacute;es, Banu Bannigas and proper Nasrids for the Muslim player.&#10;The map is point-to-point, covering the ancient Nasrid Kingdom in southeast Iberia (present-day Spain). Granada, the capital, is the jewel of the realm: the game ends if it falls into the Catholic player's hands.&#10;Each season, players receive a predetermined number of cards which they can use to move their armies and fleets or rally new units. When a battle occurs, each regiment is summoned by the play of one card of its nationality, so as Tamerlan said: &rdquo;It is better to be present with 100 soldiers than absent with 1.000.&rdquo; In other words, be sure you have the right cards to send your troops into battle.&#10;As an almost Renaissance war, different weapons will also be present. Cavalry charges and crossbows will be extremely dangerous if well combined, whereas artillery will have a significant value when maintaining or defending sieges. Your fleets will fight for sea control, enabling the transport of North African reinforcements, Catholic naval movements or blocking sieged ports.&#10;Balanced and historically accurate, the game is easy to learn but difficult to master. The Catholic player will have to decide which invasion route to choose and whether he will create a massive army, leaving the Muslim player time to reinforce his strongholds, or go for a quick campaign where losses will be difficult to replace. The Nasrid player, on the other hand, will enjoy a central position but he will need to be cautious about the internal problems that can arise&mdash; the Boabdil revolt is almost an inevitable danger to face and crush.&#10;&#10;As the Catholic player, will you gain fame and glory accomplishing the Reconquista and enlarging your kingdoms in one unified powerful state? And as the Muslim player, will you resist and save Granada or will you become the last King of the Nasrid dynasty?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Time scale: 1 year per 2-player turn&#10;Map scale: Point to point&#10;Unit scale: One block = 500-1500 soldiers&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&bull; 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;&nbsp;Mounted map&nbsp;&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 137 Rectangular blocks in various colors&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 11 rectangular tiles&#10;&bull; 2  Sheets of stickers (for blocks)&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 2  Draw bags&nbsp;&#10;&bull; 20 square castles (10 white, 10 black)&#10;&bull; 20 round watchtowers (10 white, 10 black)&#10;&bull; 26 small cubes (13 white, 13 black)&#10;&bull; 7  Wooden markers (various sizes and colors)&#10;&bull; 3&nbsp; Decks of cards (74 Christians, 67 Muslims, 17 Naval)&#10;&bull; 1  Victory Points track&#10;&bull; 2  Player Aids and 2 Battle Reference Cards (identical)&#10;&bull; 1  Rules booklet&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;GRANADA: &#10;&quot;El &uacute;ltimo baluarte de los Moros&quot; es un juego para dos jugadores que representa la campa&ntilde;a entre 1482 y 1492, durante el reinado de los Reyes Cat&oacute;licos Isabel I de Castilla y Fernando II de Arag&oacute;n, contra el Emirato de Granada de la dinast&iacute;a nazar&iacute;.

Louis XV reigns in France, and it's the height of fashion to attend his lavish balls where important luminaries dress up in extravagant gowns and fancy frock coats, all eager to surpass one another in elegance and grace. In just a few weeks, Louis XV is hosting the final Grand Ball of the season, and everyone is clamoring for you to provide them with an elegant frock coat here, a sumptuous gown there, or even a small sum to fund the great fireworks display. You quickly realize that it's not just about your tailoring business anymore; it's about creating a presence at the most prestigious ball of the era and the chance to gain everlasting fame and prestige.&#10;&#10;In Rococo: Deluxe Edition, you are the owner of a distinguished tailoring business endeavoring to increase your prestige. Each turn, you play an employee card that allows you to perform a task, such as hiring a new employee for your staff, tailoring exquisite gowns and frock coats to rent or sell, or funding some of the many decorations. However, employees are not always able to perform all tasks, so you must plan carefully how you direct them, especially as each employee grants a unique bonus &mdash; including some that generate prestige.&#10;&#10;The Grand Ball ends after seven rounds with a huge fireworks display and final scoring. You will gain prestige points for the sumptuous gowns and frock coats you have rented out to guests at the ball, certain employee bonuses, and the festive decorations you have funded. Whoever has collected the most prestige at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Rococo: Deluxe Edition contains the previously released Jewelry Box expansion, the Festivity Dresses expansion, and the Fancy Dresses promo, as well as a new &quot;Madame du Barry&quot; solo mode expansion.

The best combination is a three-of-a-kind, with three 6s beating three 5s, which beats three 4s, and so on. The next best combination is a straight, followed by a pair, followed by a single die, with higher numbers beating low ones in each of these combinations, e.g, a combination of 5-5-2 beats 4-4-6.

This is done by gaining ten Fame points, venturing into the Desolation of the Claw to find the Sword of Yitar, and presenting oneself at the Citadel of Yitar for judgement (rolled on a table).&#10;&#10;Each tyrant starts with randomly-determined attributes (Survival, Guile, Faith, and Generalship), gold, household garrison, warrior bands, and slayers (specially trained assassins). They move around the map to attack the other players, the Merciless Horde of Yin, and the Humanoids of the Claw. This can provide fame and, when attacking other players' households, gold.&#10;&#10;Tyrants can also adventure into such places as the Vale of the Prophets and the Caves of the Necromancer, which may result in gaining magic items or other benefits, but may also have negative effects.&#10;&#10;Each turn a tyrant must also roll for a random event; there is a 1/6 chance nothing will happen but otherwise a player may be ambushed, raided, given gold, etc.&#10;&#10;One unusual rule is that a player is allowed to write a secret message to another player, but it may not be delivered properly; based on a die-roll the message may go astray and a different player may receive it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

The focus of this new title is on the Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815).&#10;&#10;The RIFLES system allows the recreation of small combat engagements (five to ten units per side), using an abstract map that represents the main features of the terrain like trees, buildings, hills. Placement of terrain features is guided but is never the same on each game, always creating new tactical challenges. The enemy strategy and the fog of war is recreated with the use of random Event Markers and &ldquo;Activation Tables&rdquo; that drive the enemy units toward their objective.&#10;&#10;Rifles in the Peninsula introduces new rules to cover unique aspects of the Napoleonic Wars including mounted troops, formations, and the impact of the longer reload time of the weapons of the period (pistols, muskets, and rifles). The different attributes of the units (combat factors, quality, special traits) grenadiers, voltigeurs, cuirassiers and dragoons.&#10;&#10;The Campaign game has been greatly redesigned and is now based on the timeline of the main campaigns of the period. The new Glory Track will represent the career of the Leader of your units, your avatar in the game, and your rank will have a direct influence on the game. Each year of the campaign includes four to six main &ldquo;scenes&rdquo;: a scene can trigger one Mission on the battlefield or a Campaign Event. Twelve different Missions are available, covering classical military duties like reconnaissance as well as iconic battle episodes like the capture of a gun. Campaign Events are resolved without the need to setup the battlefield and cover episodes like barrack inspections, field maneuvers and of course duels. As a bonus, an optional mini-game The Duel (inspired by the movie, The Duelists)has been included in the package: this mini-game allows players to re-create a saber duel with a more personal perspective, providing an additional level of immersion in the historical period.&#10;&#10;From thundering muskets, to rattle of sabers, Rifles in the Peninsula vividly recreates Napoleonic skirmishes like never before.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

As you continue your indoctrination, you must prove you can handle the teachings of the Great Old One. You might go insane, or perhaps just gain a touch of the madness, but as long as you prove that you have the most mastery, you will be welcomed as the newest neophyte of Cthulhu.&#10;&#10;In Unlocking Insanity: Dice Vermiis Mysteriis, each player is trying to place dice results as efficiently as possible. Every turn, you must place a positive die result (your mastery of the indoctrination training) and also negative dice results (your growing madness). The game ends after someone fills up all of their positive or negative spaces. Your positive scores (from each positive row) are subtracted from your negative scores (from your negative brain spaces) and the player with the highest overall score wins the right to be called a neophyte of Cthulhu.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
