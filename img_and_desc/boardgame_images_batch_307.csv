Bommel. Players have to create a path placing road cards numbering from 1 to 7 in ascending order. The goal is to reach the #7 card (Treasure &quot;De Schat&quot;) first.&#10;&#10;There is 1 deck of cards that all players draw from, containing the road cards and several other cards to prevent other players from getting to the treasure or assist you in your own effort to find the treasure first.&#10;&#10;"

The oldest player starts this game. Throw the dice en move your pon over the track on the board. Execute the command which is stated by an pictogram. You either have to point out the right and exact location of the number or image that is stated on the track. The tricky thing is that the caps move around the board as a result of some orders. Some orders on the track are simple, and need you to pin point 1 image or number. Other orders force yoy to point out for example, 3 fruits or 3 figures. Every player has 3-7 playcards. everytime they slip out during the game by not pointing out the right items, they loose one playcard (it is flipped to the stop-side). The player who keeps at least one card in play while the others are played out, wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Players start in the head and move towards the tail. Landing on a coloured space gives the player one counter (quarter) of that colour; landing on a white has no effect; and landing on a black space causes the player to lose a number of quarters, the colors chosen by player.&#10;&#10;Quarters collected during the game are scored when all players have either finished or dropped out. Quarters forming a circle of a single colour score the most, quarters forming multi-coloured circles score less, while left-over quarters score least.&#10;&#10;During the game, there are four chances to drop out, identified by the grey shaded areas. This may make sense because the numbers in the black segments increase towards the end, and a player that has collected a good set of circles may want to cut her losses rather than carry on.  &#10;(This is the sole tactical choice in the game.)&#10;&#10;Paletti game no. 4065&#10;&#10;"

The service cards dictate whether the service is to the backhand, forehand an ace or a fault. The play cards are made up of 5 each of the 4 combinations of backhand/forehand to backhand/forehand and 4 smash and 4 lob cards. Scoring is the same as in lawn tennis. The two packs (service and play) are shuffled and both players receive 4 play cards to form their hand. The server then places the top service card face up to show the type of serve. An ace is a point immediately won and if a fault is drawn then another card is immediately drawn and if this is another fault, the point is lost. If it is any of the other service cards, the opponent can return it only if he has a corresponding card that allows him to play the return type or he can play a lob card. A lob card can only be returned by another lob card or a smash card. A smash can only be returned by a lob. If a player cannot return with the appropriate card then he loses that point. Players replace cards as they are played from the draw deck to make a 4 card hand. Play continues until the correct number of sets (predetermined at the start) is won.&#10;&#10;"

In an atmosphere of pessimism and charged paranoia, the citizens of Salem are at the mercy of demons &ndash; not demons of the soul, but demons of the mind. What began as a devout Puritan community devolved in a matter of months into a people torn apart by fear, lies, and fanatical orthodoxy. The residents of Salem quickly discovered that they could find Hell all around them.&#10;&#10;Salem incites the atmosphere of paranoia that held the village of Salem captive. Players act with the assumption that there are witches among them (and, in this case, there will be). Each player controls six residents of Salem, three of whom are witches. Game play is simple: try to rid the village of witches and keep the identities of your own residents secret.&#10;&#10;The game plays over the course of four rounds representing the four months (June&ndash;September 1692) in which the hysteria was at its height. Each round has two parts: a Witch Hunt and a Witch Trial, followed by hangings (the dates of which correspond to the four actual hangings that took place in Salem that year). During the Witch Hunt, players send residents to jail and provide alibis for their own jailed citizens. At the end of each round all jailed citizens stand trial. Players then collectively decide who is hanged and who is spared. The player who is most successful at discerning witches from villagers wins!&#10;&#10;While the story surrounding the Salem witch trials has become something of a legend, every character in this game is based on a real person whose life was directly touched and in some cases torn apart or taken away by the events surrounding the Salem witch trials. Extensive research has been done to craft the real-life stories of all 42 residents in the game.&#10;&#10;While this game focuses on the people and events specific to Salem, Massachusetts, similar witch hunts were taking place as far north as Maine and as far West as Connecticut.
