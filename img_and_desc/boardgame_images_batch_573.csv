Su Doku (or Sudoku) is a mathematical puzzle which consists of a grid of 9 3x3 squares. The completed puzzle has the digits 1 to 9 in each 3x3 square and the digits 1 to 9 in each row and column in the grid. The game poses a number of partially complete grids which must be completed correctly and can be used in either the solo puzzle or two player game.&#10;&#10;The solo mode allows a player to attempt to correctly complete a Su Doku. This function of the set is not technically a game and is actually solo puzzle solving.&#10;&#10;The two player mode sees both players attempting to complete the same puzzle in the same grid. Players may place a tile as soon as they are sure that the placement is correct; there is no turn sequence. The players race to place as many correct tiles as possible before the whole puzzle is complete. The winning player is the one who placed the largest number of correct tiles in the puzzle, less the number of incorrect tiles which they placed. The tiles are double sided and are printed with a different colour on each side to allow players to identify which tiles were placed by which player.&#10;&#10;"

If you are correct, you can move up to 6 spaces. If you roll the pedestrian, you can move him. He is an extra piece on the board and can 'walk' from zebra crossing to zebra crossing. If he is on a crossing when your piece arrives before it, you cannot go over the crossing until the pedestrian has been moved elsewhere.&#10;&#10;The first player to arrive home, wins.&#10;&#10;One nice touch is that the question cards can be sorted in to four levels of difficulty, so the game can happily be played by various age groups.&#10;&#10;"

A challenging card game with a great balance of skill and luck, and lots of interesting card combinations. Average play time is around 10 minutes per race, with the players deciding how many races they want to play in order to decide the championship winner, allowing Final Lap to be played as a time filler, or an entire evening of entertainment.&#10;&#10;Players each manage a racing team of two cars and compete in a number of races through to see who can accumulate the most championship points and become the champion. In each race players need to correctly manage their hand of cards, reaping the biggest rewards possible from their good cards, and reducing the negative imapct suffered from their bad ones, to ensure the cars in their team score as many championship points as possible.&#10;&#10;Championship points are only scored in a race by the cars that finish in the top 6 positions.  At the beginning of each race the cars are laid out in the reverse finishing order from the previous race.  Each player is dealt a hand of cards and during a race a player must use all of the cards in their hand.   As a car finishing in last place will ensure that it begins qualifying in the following race in first position, it is therefore beneficial for cars to finish as low as possible in a race if they do not finish in the top 6 positions, which results some very interesting and tactical game play.&#10;&#10;After the cars are laid out in order at the beginning of a race, and players have received their hand of cards, qualifying will take place.  Certain cards can be used during qualifying or during a race.  If a player uses a card during qualifying to improve the qualifying order of one or both of their cars, they will discard the card and draw a random card to replace it.  Since players must use all of the cards in their hand during a race, they will need to evaluate whether they can afford to use such cards during qualifying as it may result it them drawing a very bad card as a replacement.&#10;&#10;During a race players can have their cars take pit stops.  When a car takes it pit stop it allows the players to discard a card from their hand without having to play it, which acts as an outlet to remove bad cards from a players hand.  Pit stops need to be managed effectively as they can only be taken by cars that require them, and any cards not discarded through pit stops must be played even if they have severely negative consequences for your cars.&#10;&#10;Excellent hand management is crucial in this game.  After you receive your hand of cards you need to formulate a race plan, working out how to get the most out of the cards you&rsquo;ve been dealt.  Adaptability is also key, being able to change a race plan or abandon it altogether as interactions with other players may not go as expected.&#10;&#10;Final Lap is a hugely flavourful card game, with a whole range of racing events covered by cards, including qualifying, pit stops, crashes, oil spills, spin outs, tyre punctures, yellow flags, team orders, defensive lines, slip streaming, car setup, racing strategies, repairs and mechanical problems with engines and gear boxes.&#10;&#10;"

The game mimics social life in 1814 &mdash; if one adds magic. The goal is to improve one&rsquo;s social standing. Social standing is the value of one&rsquo;s cards. One improves it by acquiring better cards. As with all romances, the game ends when a character becomes betrothed by losing his or her last card.&quot;&#10;&#10;AVAILABILITY:&#10;The game is available from the designers website as a print-and-play.  Some character cards are only available directly from the author at conventions.  The game additionally requires a standard deck of playing cards and a pen and paper.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:&#10;Each player will play the character on their character card.  Each character card has a different balance of a number of different attributes.  The attributes each map to a suit of a standard set of face cards.  Each player holds five facecards with which one will attempt to acquire the other player's character cards from them.&#10;&#10;Players will take turns making advances via one of their attributes toward another player.  That player can respond in kind, or counter with a different, attribute (analogous to each suit having a different suit which can trump it).  Players then simultaneously reveal their played cards and add that total to the corresponding attribute on their character card.  The player with the higher total triumphs, and takes the opposing player's character card.&#10;&#10;If one does not hold a suitable card one can attempt to bluff by playing a face card as if it is suitable, but when it comes time to compare scores, only the attribute on the character card is counted, with no additional strength given via the face card.  Alternatively one can opt to not participate in an exchange at all, before the face cards are revealed, but one will lose a turn as a penalty for doing so.&#10;&#10;Play continues in rounds until only a player loses her last card.  Points are counted, and the player with the highest points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts the game with a secret-formula card, detailing the distinct combination of ingredients the player needs to score a victory point.&#10;&#10;"

The player on turn flips one of them and then looks for another one with the same image. And what is the difference with a common memory game?!? The fact that each image is repeated 3 times and the tile you look for doesn't have to be on the table, it could be in your opponents loot! you have to remember this in order to steal it!&#10;&#10;"

141937,,"A very long time ago, when science sucked and magic was really trendy, when there was a really huge offer of heroes and, luckily, they did not want to be paid, when behind each door you could find ugly but precious treasures or cute but lethal monsters and a dice roll could often decide the destiny of the humankind...&#10;... in other words, when the world was a funny place, some incautious accepted each dangerous mission that was assigned by the most powerful characters of the time. The fate was on their side and their gestures became legendary.&#10;&#10;Could you beat their fame? Be incautious yourself and try to build an even more legendary legend!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round all the dice are rolled and grouped by their value.&#10;&#10;In turn, each player chooses one group of dice and place it beside a deck of his choice in order to recruit Heroes, accepting new Missions or discover new lands (and the monster that lives there!) recovering special items.&#10;&#10;When all the dice will be placed, each player in turn will use one or more heroes from his hand in order to defeat the monsters. The colour of the dice used to discover the land determines the skills the hero must have in order to participate to the battle.&#10;&#10;The recruited Heroes will be added to the player&rsquo;s hand, while Missions, defeated Monsters and Items will be placed in front of him side by side forming the timeline of his legend.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player will gain points for each item, monster and accomplished mission.&#10;&#10;To be accomplished, some of the missions requires the player to discover certain items or to kill a specific monster (so only the cards placed after the Mission in the timeline will be considered), while some other requires the player to have already discovered certain items or killed a monster (so, in this case only the cards placed before the Mission in the timeline will be considered).&#10;&#10;The player with the most points will be the winner.&#10;&#10;"
