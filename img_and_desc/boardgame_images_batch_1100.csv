Germs are in a constant state of growth and propagation. In the petri dish, only one faction of germs can reign supreme. It is an epic war of microscopic proportions. Each faction will vie for control of the petri dish, one section at a time. Through sheer dominance, the strongest germ faction will win out. The fate of the petri dish begins with the roll of the dice.&#10;&#10;In Germ War, two players will attempt to grow and propagate their germ factions, in order to conquer the petri dish. The faction that dominates a majority of the sections, reign supreme and wins!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, a player will mark off the next available spot on the round tracker. Alternating turns, players can do one of two actions: &quot;Germ Growth or &quot;Germ Strength Increased&quot;. When a player chooses Germ Growth, they will draft a reproduction die and apply the effects. If a player has a section(s) with a die valued at six, that player will increase their Germ Strength by marking off their germ icon and rotate the die to a one. The first player to do this three times in a section, will maintain a dominate presence in that section for the remainder of the section. If a player does this four times in the game, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Meanwhile pirates intend to sail in, steal that rum, and drink it all . These two factions (*Crown* and *Pirate*) play their conflict out over a two player asymmetric card game. Each player has a deck, a hand of cards, coins, and a menu of 3 actions to choose from each turn. But what each does varies substantially.&#10;&#10;The *Crown* player will work in secret, laying traps and pushing for an economic victory. They score rum by founding it on an island and investing coins into it over time. They protect that investment by placing hazards in front of the island face-down. When the Pirate player tries to raid that island the Crown can decide to spend their coin to raise those hazards against the Pirate, stopping them or making them pay a terrible price. The Crown may alternatively place traps or economic investments on their islands, luring the Pirate to certain doom or increasing the momentum of the Crown's victory. If the Crown manages to hold out and score four points of rum, they win the game.&#10;&#10;The *Pirate* player will assemble ships and crew. These will hopefully raid their way to where the rum is with a combination of deduction and perseverance. But regardless they will trigger and combo together unique crew's unique abilities to gain an advantage. If the Pirate finds four bottles of rum (quality doesn't matter), they win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"
