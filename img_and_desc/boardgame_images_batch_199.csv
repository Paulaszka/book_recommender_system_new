This game was probably played in the very first Roman tavern.  It has remained an Italian favorite to this day.&#10;&#10;Object: Most throws of the dice have a price, and players pay the board until someone throws the lucky combination that wins all.&#10;&#10;The games in this series are from our favorite &quot;watering holes&quot; on four different continents.  We are proud to present them to our friends here at home, and have forced ourselves to consume a lot of memorable local brews in the fulfillment of this endeavor.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players take turns to roll two dice.  Any number other than 7, 2 or 12 requires placing the stake (or stone from the set) on the number rolled on the supplied board.&#10;&#10;Roll 2 and take the stakes from 8-12, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 12 and take the stakes from 2-6, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 7 and you take ALL the stakes, or place one stake on 7 if the board is empty.&#10;&#10;Play continues until agreed, or all but one of the players is out of money (or stones).  A Neapolitan version ignores the rules for 2 and 12, and treats them as any other non-7 roll.&#10;&#10;"

Players battle to win the down by playing the strongest hand.&#10;&#10;Game play combines elements of classic playing card games to simulate the action on the field. Players must decide how best to play their cards. For instance, cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, three-of-a-kind, or five-card poker-style 'Power Hands'. Much like a football coach deciding what play to call, or the quarterback choosing his best option, players must decide whether to play strong card(s) immediately, or to hold back in hopes of using it to put together a stronger hand.&#10;&#10;Other elements of Card Football include team and player chips, game board, a score board, a referee/yard marker and dice that are used for fumble, field goal and injury situations.&#10;&#10;Card Football allows for one, two, three and four-player modes. The single-player game mode is set up so that an individual can take on 'the system' and pick up the basics of the game before challenging friends in an all-out gridiron battle. In addition, the learning curve with Card Football is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned in two to five minutes, or after a few series of downs.&#10;&#10;If it happens on the field, you'll find it in Card Football. From field goals, punts and extra points, to fumbles, interceptions and last-second heroics, you get it all in four quarters of Card Football action.&#10;&#10;"

Continuing the example, you might not add to your 3 of a Kind with the blue dice, but maybe you'll pick up a Full House with the red.  No problem -- now you're betting on a Full House.  You can switch back and forth on the hand you're rolling on (blue dice or red), but you must always keep the individual pairs of dice together.&#10;&#10;"

Imagine if you pick up a card and it says. &quot; Coffee is a natural laxative for me.&quot; You had to read it out loud without proofreading. Would that make you laugh? possibly. What if you had to get down on one knee and grab the persons hand to your left and confess your undying love for them. Would that make you laugh? Probably. If anyone laughs during game play they must move back spaces. Two categories are used, &quot; Feel The Part&quot; the acting out a silly situation category and &quot;say It Out Loud&quot; where you just pick up and read it. A game of non stop laughter.&#10;&#10;"
