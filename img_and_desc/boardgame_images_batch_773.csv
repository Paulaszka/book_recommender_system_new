As the game progresses, players will create their own personal hero decks composed of Arrow (green) cards they have previously played.&#10;&#10;Each card has a power level. Green cards range from 1 to 4. Pink cards range from 1 to 7.  Certain Green cards will also get extra power depending on their text.  Each card will also have usually 2 or more traits: Criminal, Guns, Archer, Petty, Brawler, Drugs, Psycho, Police, Tech, Government, Organization, Money, Political, Skill, Equipment, Action, Arrow, Romance, Ally, Friendship, Family.&#10;&#10;Each round has 6 phases, with players taking it turns to act first each round:&#10;&#10;1.   Foundry Phase&#10;-    At the beginning of each round flip over the top 3X cards from the Arrow Deck and place them face up in a row (Foundry Row). X = the number of players.&#10;&#10;2.   Starling Phase&#10;-    At the beginning of each round flip over the top 2X cards from the Villain Deck and place them face up in a row (Starling Row).  When you flip over a minor card (power of 1 or 2) flip over another card and stack the minor card with it. The stack counts as a single card on the Starling Row, but has the combined power of all of the cards in the stack. (The stack may contain several minor cards under the major card (power 3 or higher)).&#10;&#10;3.   Hero Phase&#10;-    Starting with the round leader each player picks one card from the Foundry Row and puts it into their hand. This continues until each player has picked 3 cards. If you pick a card that says draw 1 immediately draw one card from the Arrow Deck and put it in your hand. If the drawn card also says draw 1 then draw again and so on. If the Arrow Deck is used up draw 3 cards from your Hero Deck instead. At the end of the phase the lead player passes to the player on his left.&#10;&#10;4.   Capture Phase&#10;-    Starting with the (new) lead player, each player captures one or more cards (or stacks of cards) from the Starling Row and puts them into their Victory Pile. The total power of the pink cards you capture must be equal to or exceeded by the total power of the green cards you picked/drew this turn.&#10;&#10;5.   Bonus Phase&#10;-    Put a victory token in your victory pile if you have played in capture phase 2 or more skill cards, 2 or more money cards, 2 characters with a romantic relationship or 2 characters with a family relationship&#10;&#10;6.   Recovery Phase&#10;-    Place all green cards you played this turn into your Hero Deck discard pile.  Any Villain card not captured remains in play.&#10;&#10;Each player has his own victory pile. During the course of the game players will acquire victory tokens and villain cards which they will keep in their victory pile.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the villain cards are captured. Players add up the value of all the cards and tokens in their Victory Pile. Each villain card is worth victory points equal to its power rating.  2 extra victory points are gained for each Super Villain captured. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

There are two ways to start the game, in fast version each player will have a &quot;foundation&quot; card, and in normal version players start empty handed.&#10;&#10;In turn, the active player will first roll a six-sided die. On a 6, he loses his turn. On a 1, a 3, a 4 or a 5, he has the choice between drawing 1 &quot;construction&quot; card or 2 &quot;tree&quot; cards. On a 2, he performs the action &quot;draw&quot; twice. Then, if he can, if he wants, he can play cards from his hand. The goal is to build the houses of the &quot;Moigeux&quot;, small creatures who think only of their material goods and who never cease to build ever bigger or always more ... To build, we will have to make combinations. For example, to build a roof, you will need the &quot;roof&quot; card and a &quot;green wood&quot; card + &quot;brown wood&quot; card. You discard the raw material and place your roof in front of you.&#10;&#10;There are action cards that let you interact with other players or defend yourself against action cards from other players. &#10;Once your turn is over, you must not have more than 10 cards in hand.&#10;&#10;How do I win?&#10;&#10;When the &quot;Construction&quot; stack is empty, the game ends. The points in the top right corner on the &quot;Construction&quot; cards are counted and the one with the most points is declared &quot;Grand Vainqueur&quot; or Winner.&#10;&#10;"

Major game play mechanics include hand management, press your luck, voting and trading, negotiation, and take that!  The game is played over seven rounds, with each round consisting of an election phase to determine the group's leader, and a filibuster phase to block the policy revealed that round.&#10;&#10;The leader is responsible for increasing the filibuster time to meet or exceed the minimum number of hours required to successfully block the policy. They also interact with the Time Deck, which is full of events that affect the players and will typically cause the end of the round. Non-leader players during a round act as supporting Senators that play assists and pass cards to the leader to help effectively block the policy and meet the Filibuster requirements for the round.&#10;&#10;If at any time the players fail to block 4 policies, everyone loses! If all 7 rounds are completed and at least 4 policies have been successfully blocked, the Senator who earned the most influence (rewarded based on performance while leading a filibuster, as well as playing assists and passing cards) is the true winner!&#10;&#10;So, be sure to work with your colleagues to prevent too many policies from passing through... but always look for ways to help yourself a little more than your fellow Senators so that you come out on top!&#10;&#10;"

The war like its predecessor, the War of the Spanish Succession (excellently portrayed by Don Herndon&rsquo;s No Peace Without Spain!) was fought primarily to determine who would succeed to the throne of a great empire, in this case the Austrian Empire. When the current ruler of the Austrian crown lands and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Charles VI died without male issue he had laid the groundwork for his eldest daughter Maria Theresa to succeed to the Hapsburg crown lands.  Known as the &ldquo;Pragmatic Sanction&rdquo;, this diplomatic effort obtained the agreement of the leading powers of Europe to her accession to the Hapsburg dominions and the election of her paramour as the next Holy Roman Emperor. However, with the opportunistic seizure of Silesia by the young Frederick the Great of Prussia, the agreement unraveled and the war began.  In time, it would involve virtually all of Europe.&#10;&#10;One player represents the Austrian interest represented by the Austrians and those powers in Europe faithful to the original agreement, (&ldquo;the Pragmatic Alliance&rdquo;). The other player represents the challengers to the Austrians, the Bavarian rival for the Imperial title, Charles Albert and his supporters, primarily the Bourbon rulers of France and Spain intermittently joined by Prussia (&ldquo;the Bourbons&rdquo;). Each &ldquo;faction/alliance&rdquo; consists of a number of allied powers representing the military forces of various states and royal houses of Europe.&#10;&#10;The simulation is based upon the No Peace Without Spain system, yet adapted to reflect the historical situation of 1741. Victory is determined by the faction that more closely obtains their goals - represented by victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
