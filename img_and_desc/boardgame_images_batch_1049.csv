It is roughly contemporaneous with Mehen and Senet. One of the most mysterious of ancient games, only two partial boards have been discovered by archaeologists, along with a detailed tomb painting depicting the board layout and playing pieces, and one sculpture depicting players playing it aboard a ship. Game scholar and designer Zach Horton recreated a speculative version of the game and it was released in two versions by Pandora Games: as a deluxe boxed Kickstarter set with Mehen and later as a standalone game. This modern reconstruction closely follows the ancient evidence and produces a unique game with a trading theme wherein players send ships out on trading missions and wager on when they will return, while manipulating them en route in an attempt to fulfill their own predictions and foils their opponents'.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes a unique three-dimensional board, enabling playing pieces to be placed both flat on spaces and upright in grooves. This aspect has been re-created in the modern version utilizing a handmade wooden board.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each player chooses on their turn from a number of different options, from gaining sticks to throw to obtaining movement banks that can be accumulated for later sprints, to sending a new ship off on its journey. No player &ldquo;owns&rdquo; any of the ships. Any player may move any combination of ships however they wish. Victory points are obtained by performing certain actions (setting sail, picking up goods, bringing goods home), as well as by correctly predicting how long a given ship will be at sea. Every time a ship sets sail, all players mark their prediction on a simple, but hidden, ledger. When a ship returns, predictions are checked against the actual results. Meanwhile, all players manipulate conditions on the board to try to make their own predictions come true!&#10;&#10;Any number of ships can be sailed in a game, but only 5 can be on the board at any given time. Only 5 cargoes can be picked up and returned to port during the game.  Once all have been picked up, &#10;ships can continue to sail, but do not pick up any cargo on the Foreign Port space (though they must  still pause there).&#10;Once all 5 cargoes have been returned to Port, the game ends.  After scoring that ship, the player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Your only chance is build an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse weapon) from parts you find in the lab and fire it off to destroy the Hoover-Bot. Can you build the EMP in time, or will you be overrun by attacking critters and meet your Hoovergeddon.&#10;&#10;Game Description&#10;&#10;Arachnid is a cooperative game for 2-4 players. Each player is a spider with unique abilities controlled by their own action board with upgradable worker placement spots. The center play area is a hex grid, where the spiders reside and tiles are placed as the web is spun. This shared web is the spider&rsquo;s home, where food is trapped, new skills are acquired, and new workers are hatched.&#10;&#10;Flies occasionally fly by, becoming trapped, and eventually, food. Players influence when the Flies are triggered, but this also increases the risk of Critters attacking the web. It's a fine balance between starvation and safety. Players can also enhance their spider skills, but this involves sacrificing parts of their valuable web home.&#10;&#10;How to lose&#10;&#10;-If the web somehow becomes detached from the edges of the board due to critter attacks, it will mean the end of the colony.&#10;&#10;-if the Golden Scarab reached the Den in the center of the web , then &quot;Activates&quot;, the colony will be destroyed.&#10;&#10;-If the the Hoover-Bot reaches the web, the game will end in a horrible Hoovergeddon.&#10;&#10;How to win&#10;&#10;Find enough spare parts to create the EMP, then all spiders meet at the Den to set it off and fry the Hoover-Bot.
