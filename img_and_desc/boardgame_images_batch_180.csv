Altogether, Capes &amp; Cowls provides over 75 characters with over 100 Powers.&#10;    &#10;Capes &amp; Cowls is played on a unique Battleboard whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though certain game situations do require a roll of the Battle Die, skillful players will find themselves seldom relying on luck to determine the outcome of an action. In short, the player who recruits and manages his team of Heroes most wisely will nearly always prove the victor.&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls offers the following 3 modes of play:&#10;&#10;1. Basic: In the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of 2 or 3 Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and dukes it out with his opponent&rsquo;s team for a predetermined number of rounds. The victory goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;2. Standard: The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of 4 or 5 Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. The victory, as in the Basic Game, goes to the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;3. Adventure: The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure.&#10;&#10;In addition to the above modes of play, Capes &amp; Cowls also allows for solitaire and multiplayer variations.&#10;&#10;Wyrd City&mdash;where the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; are bad, the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; are you, and the dress code is decidedly unusual.&#10;&#10;Capes &amp; Cowls: The Superhero Board Game! Let the battle begin!&#10;&#10;"

The game focuses on the Marine F4U Corsairs in the Pacific. The 2 campaigns cover the Solomon Islands campaign that lasted from late 1942 to early 1944.&#10;&#10;Also, the aircraft under your command center on the Corsair, but you also get to decide if you want to include Dauntlesses, B-25s, and B-17s as part of your group. Each aircraft has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, the B-17s carry a lot of bombs and are hard to shoot down, but they are terrible versus naval targets and only moderately accurate against all but the largest of land targets.&#10;&#10;The game also goes more in-depth on the tactical options you have while over target. Each turn, each aircraft can become &quot;Offensive&quot; which gives it an attack bonus, but also makes it easier to be attacked when it gets shot at. Likewise, aircraft can be &quot;Defensive&quot; which penalizes their own attacks and makes them harder to hit. &quot;Slow&quot; pilots can &quot;Rush&quot; their attack at a penalty and attack during the Fast pilot step, and &quot;Fast&quot; pilots can Wait and get a bonus if they attack during the Slow pilot step.&#10;&#10;Like the other games in the &quot;Leader&quot; series, Corsair Leader is a solitaire game.&#10;&#10;The game is published in both PDF and Vassal versions.&#10;&#10;Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen&#10;&#10;"

There are also some German companies for the front trenches.  There are two 13x19&quot; maps with over 200 counters. There are two rules books - standard rules that are 5 pages and Messines:1917 rules that run another 4 pages.  There are two scenarios - first day and campaign. Artillery is the centerpiece of the game with four different types of bombardment (saturation,  standard, intermittent, and gas) possible.  There are three types of guns - field, medium, and heavy with each best suited to certain roles.  For Messines the addition of mines makes initial set up and play a real chess match.  The key to victory is correct deployment and effective use of reserves.  For the Allies, one of the key decisions is how much to bombard.  It is very effective but it also destroys the drainage systems of the area and leads to a quagmire that with eliminated possibilities.  For the German player, commitment of reserves is the key.  He has to guess correctly at the main points of attack by the British player before they have sufficiently evolved to make the attack plan apparent.&#10;&#10;"
