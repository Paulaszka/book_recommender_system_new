Skirmish wargames focus on individual models and their abilities, rather than large units of soldiers. &#10;In this game, each unit moves, acts, and fights on its own.&#10;&#10;Dark fantasy is a type of fantasy where horror trumps the majestic. &#10;Where fire spells burn their casters and getting sliced by a sword causes more injury than just a few hit points. &#10;So, frame your mind around the darkest parts of fantasy, where life is horrific, knights do not always save the day, and princesses may be monsters in disguise.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Unlike russian loto or bingo, players decide for themselves which numbers to create (in the first phase of game) and for what postulate to use them (in the second phase of game).&#10;&#10;So Binomial has two phases. In first, the first player rolls dice 16 times, and from received 16 numerics players create numbers secretly from each other. Then players reveal up to 16 cards from the deck and choose most appropriate numbers from their own for announced postulates on cards. The game ends either when all 16 postulates are revealed, or when at least one player uses all of his numbers. The player with the most victory points is winner!&#10;&#10;"

The royal power no longer trusted the prince of Cond&eacute;, leader of the Protestant party.  A few months after the signing, the Catholics attempted to capture the prince of Cond&eacute; and Admiral Coligny by surprise. The plot failed and the Protestant commanders reassembled with their armies and took refuge at La Rochelle.&#10;Thus began the campaign constituting the third War of Religion at the end of the summer of 1568. The objective of the Royal Army, commanded by the Duc of Anjou, future king Henry III, was to seize the Protestant towns between Charente and Dordogne. After a winter campaign marked by desertions on both sides, the Duc of Anjou claimed victory on 13 March 1569 at Jarnac when the prince of Cond&eacute; was cut down in cold blood while surrendering to a Catholic nobleman. Coligny succeeded him as commander of the Huguenot army. Despite this victory, Anjou was unsuccessful in capturing the city of Cognac. Furthermore, he didn&rsquo;t have enough troops to supply a garrison in the cities seized from the Protestants.&#10;On 25 June 1569, Admiral de Coligny took his revenge and defeated the Catholics at La Roche-L&rsquo;Abeille where Strozzi, colonel general of the royal infantry, was taken prisoner. He then lay siege to Poitiers but was forced to abandon it after several weeks in order to confront the Catholic troops preparing to him from his rear bases.&#10;&#10;On 3 October 1569, the two armies faced off near Moncontour.Gaspard de Coligny did not want to engage in battle, knowing he was outnumbered. However, German mercenaries among his troops were unhappy at not being paid and precipitated the movement. The Catholic troops were better prepared, greater in number and more heavily armed and easily pushed back the assault of the Protestants who were forced into a disorderly retreat.&#10;Although it barely lasted two hours, this battle resulted in between 6000 and 10.000 men dead or taken prisoner on the side of the Protestants compared to 1000 for the Catholics.

Each one gets coins from the bank, depending on who his/her merchant is, and what cards he/she possesses (some cards offer income).&#10;- Reveal cards: The active player draws and reveals a number of cards from the deck, arranges them into two or three &ldquo;bouquets&rdquo; and offers them, one by one, for auction. The other players announce their bids (each player can bid more than once), and this continues until someone offers an amount no-one else wishes to surpass. The active merchant then has two options: to give the bouquet to the highest bidder and get the money, or to keep the bouquet to himself/herself, and give the high bidder an amount of money equal to half his/her high bid.&#10;&#10;End of the Game&#10;At the end of the second day the game ends, and each player counts the points he/she gathered from his/her flower collection and his/her coins. The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

It is a cooperative/competitive Medieval Fantasy Strategy Game of my creation.&#10;In the base game two to four players take on the roles of Noble Houses fighting for the King, gaining favor by winning battles and proving themselves worthy administrators in the midst of a Civil War. Players work together to overcome the rebels while competing with your allies to earn the most favor from the throne.&#10;&#10;Key Features:&#10;&#10;     Factions:  Pick from one of four houses to play as during the campaign (House Kel, Lotan, Shobal, or the 7th Corps). Each Noble House has their own individual and unique strategy.&#10;     Base Building:  increase your power and prestige by constructing military, defensive and economical buildings that can gain access to greater resources and higher quality troop types as they are upgraded.&#10;     Resources:  As you expand influence and improve your land, you gain access to more resources. These need to be properly handled in order to bolster your power, help you grow and gain favor with the King.&#10;     Army Recruiting:  Create your own army from core loyalist warriors and elite house troops.  Customize your army according to your vision. Train units to meet battlefield demands. Cooperate by sharing units through alliances to defeat the rebels and unite the loyalist factions.&#10;     Political intrigue:  Internal and External events can quickly change the fortune for you and your fellow loyalists.  Manipulate these events to further your own goals while hindering those of your rivals.&#10;     Battles:  Wage war against the rebels in skirmishes as small as five units or up to a massive battle of forty units.  Gather your allies to form large armies to bring the battle to the doorstep of the rebels.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Tu'x Rebellion is a card-based strategy game similar to other customizable trading card games with battle tactics similar to tabletop miniature games. Players take turns simultaneously.  Each round is divided into phases; draw, build, conflict and discard.  Simultaneous play means the game is exciting for everyone and no one is left waiting to take action.&#10;&#10;Battles are resolved in the conflict phase. One round of battle is split into the: Set up, Draw, Infantry, Ranged, Cavalry, Movement and Discard phases.  Action continues for allied players and the player controlling the Rebel Army during the battle.&#10;&#10;You win by reaching a certain threshold of favor with the King.  However, everyone loses if the loyalists are defeated twice in battle or any player loses all the troops under their command.  Players must constantly balance the competitive and cooperative aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from designer&#10;&#10;"

A round should take about 5 minutes or less.  The last player left alive gets a victory point.  Cards in the game represent Psychic Powers. Each turn a player draws a card and declares what power they are going to use.  At this point, any player may challenge the use of this power.  If the player claiming to play the power doesn't have that card in hand, they are out for the round, but if the player has the card, the challenger is out.  At this point, the player uses their power card and discards face up.  This continues until only one player is left, and points are awarded.  Then the deck is reshuffled and the next round begins.  The game is played until one player reaches the target number of victory points to win.&#10;&#10;Each time the game is played, only a subset of powers are used. The number of powers in a game is based on the number of players, and there are rules governing how powers are selected.  This leads to a unique experience each time the game is played.

Each new segment must be placed next to your monster's head or tail &mdash; with the head or tail piece then moving to the far side of the newly-placed piece &mdash; and you can cross the path of other monsters on the board only if you can go above them.&#10;&#10;Once all players are blocked or everyone has placed all of their segments (with the size of the game board changing depending on the number of players), whoever has the fewest segments remaining in their reserve wins. In case of a tie, the tied player whose monster head has the highest elevation wins.&#10;&#10;"
