The animal tiles are shuffled and placed next to the board in a face-down stack. Players take turns drawing a tile and then look for the corresponding space on the board. Then they try to reach that space with one of the 5 monkeys. Each of the monkeys carries 1-3 fruits, and this number shows exactly how many spaces that monkey can move. If none of the monkeys can reach that space, the tile is removed from the game. If a monkey succeeds, the tile is placed on the clearing space that shows the fruit which the successful monkey is carrying. Then the player may also place the monkey on the clearing. Monkeys that have been placed on the clearing stay there for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all animal tiles have been used or all monkeys are on the clearing. If there are 7 or more animal tiles and 3 monkeys on the clearing, the players win the game. Only animal tiles accompanied by a monkey count.&#10;&#10;"

Each player has an empty pole and six wooden beads in the colors red, blue, green, yellow, orange and purple. On their turn the player throws a color die, and if they do not already have a bead of the color thrown then they place one on their pole. The winner is the first player to have collected a set of beads of all six colors. In a variant game, the beads are all placed in groups on the board, which shows a multi-colored worm. The beads must be placed on a player's pole in the same order in which they appear on the worm.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Rainbow Towers&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each civilization is entirely different from the others and has its own distinctive benefits and heroes.  The game has no specific time period, so Alexander the Great can battle Rommel with his armies, while Montezuma can be played against Genghis Khan.&#10;Rivalry emphasizes cooperation between players since individual civilizations will have difficulty winning alone.  While predominantly a military strategy game, the historical flavor and distinctiveness between civilizations adds a role-playing element.&#10;&#10;"
