Each card holder is then placed window-side up on the game board, in the matching-color rectangle. Each player selects a token, places it on the 'Start' space on the game board, and rolls the dice to determine who plays first (highest roller, play continues clockwise).&#10;&#10;Ona player's turn, that player rolls the dice and moves his token that number of spaces in any direction (backtracking in the same turn is not allowed). If the player lands on a colored, lettered space, the player must open the corresponding window (by letter) on the corresponding card holder (by color). If a player lands on one of the four outside corner spaces, [b]all[/b] the windows on the corresponding card holder (by color) may be opened. When a player lands on a pink &quot;Face ID&quot; space, the player selects [b]any[/b] card holder and opens all unopened windows. When landing on a pink space marked FAID, the player selects any holder and opens the F, A, I, and D windows.&#10;&#10;During his turn, after opening any windows allowed, a player may try to identify the person on the card in the card holder that corresponds (by color) to the space his token is on. To identify the person, the player must state the name of the person on the card--[b]not[/b] the name of any character the person has played. (Example: &quot;Bob Keeshan&quot; would be correct, but not &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.)&#10;&#10;All players determine whether the player is correct. If there is a dispute, the Master List is consulted by revealing the identification number at the bottom of the card. The player making the identification consults the list in secret. If he is correct, the card is removed from the holder and rewarded to the player, who closes the windows and places another card in the holder. That player rolls the dice and moves again.&#10;&#10;If the player is incorrect, he places the card holder back on the board (leaving the windows open or closed, as they were). He does not reveal the correct identity of the person on the card, but he may not (of course) make another guess on the same card.&#10;&#10;An incorrect guess, or no guess, ends a player's turn.&#10;&#10;After a player has collected two cards of each color, he must land on a FACE ID space to attempt a Final Face Identification. When he lands on a FACE ID space, the player must attempt to identify the face in the corresponding (by color) card holder. The player consults the back of his collected face cards, which contain assorted letters. Those letters determine which if any of the unopened windows on the card holder he may open before attempting to identify the person.&#10;&#10;If the player is incorrect on the Final Face Identification, his turn is over and play resumes as normal. On that player's turn, he must attempt again to land on another FACE ID space to make another Final Face Identification.&#10;&#10;If the player is correct on the Final Face Identification, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Players roll dice to improve their portfolios, expand their railroads, harness new trains or force dividends. Play continues until three of the four railroads have expended their cubes.  The most cash wins.&#10;&#10;This game is an approachable, quick train game, similar to a lot of Winsome games.  It uses cubes for track.  It uses shares in a manner similar to Chicago Express.  Payouts and dividend trigger in a manner similar to German Railways.  The unique twist in this game is that there are no treasuries for each company - dice are rolled for any company the player has a share of - and actions are performed on behalf of that company by the player.  Trains are also purchased which work similar to 18XX trains and also add bonuses to the company value as well.  Dice may be rerolled, but 6's are automatically removed and one group of dice for a specific number must always be locked for each roll, like Pickomino.&#10;&#10;There are choices to be made along the way - do you invest heavily and buy into shares?  Do you force a swap with your opponent to ruin his position?  Do you build into another railroad now to trigger a dividend or wait until your opponent goes to take it?  Do you take a turn to send your opponent's company into the woods?  How do you manage a poor roll?&#10;&#10;This was designed for the 2011 One Sheet PnP Contest.&#10;&#10;"

Who knew that someday a couple of game designers would move the farts from inside the box to the front cover?&#10;&#10;Yes, PRRRT... &ndash; from the designing duo of Ludovic Maublanc and Bruno Cathala &ndash; is all about the rip-roarers and pants-busters that emerge from one's nether regions, more specifically about determining who dealt it (while thankfully avoiding the &quot;who smelt it&quot; end of the equation).&#10;&#10;Each round a situation card is revealed, such as a small crowd in an elevator, and a number of people cards equal to the crowd depicted on the card are turned face up. People cards are valued from 1 to 10 based on the amount of shame that person would have towards you should you be revealed as the culprit. Grannies are merciless...&#10;&#10;Each player receives a hand of five odor cards, ranging in value from 0 to 7, with one 7, two 6s and so on to eight 0s. Going once around the table, each player in turn asks his neighbor, &quot;So how about it? Are you the one contributing to climate change? Are you the one making more methane?&quot; And so on. That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.&#10;&#10;If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent. With odor comes power!&#10;&#10;"

As the battlefield dissolves into a frenzy of nearly unguided machines controlled in only erratic bursts, the opposing sides must salvage the situation by using balloons and ground crews to locate and regain control of strayed telematons. However, the armed telematons are unpredictable in their damaged states and the battle is by no means over, so artillery has been brought to bear as well.

Players can interact with them by learning their identities (observation balloons), firing on them (artillery) or attempting to salvage and control them by forming lines of retrieval crews, telegraph wires, and telematons. Only telematons within these lines can be controlled, and control of these units is lost through the severing of the line through hostile attack or poor tactical movements. Thre are two ways to win; either recovering 10 telematons and returning them to your headquarters or destroying the enemy's headquarters before they can reach this goal.&#10;&#10;"

The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.&#10;&#10;The player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.&#10;&#10;The map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.&#10;&#10;The troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.&#10;&#10;Insurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.&#10;&#10;At the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;&bull; 17x22 map&#10;&#10;&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters&#10;&#10;&bull;  1 player aid&#10;&#10;&bull; 1 die&#10;&#10;&bull; Rule booklet&#10;&#10;"

Make your throw and pass the dice to the next player until everyone has had their 10 throws.&#10;&#10;Different color dice combinations will allow you to activate a section of your ship (you only activate a ship section once) and then stock it with resources for the battle phase. Each activated ship section is also worth one damage rating point towards your total ship so it is advised that during the build phase to try and activate as many sections of your ship as possible.

If you use a resource, rotate the resource die face down one number (i.e. 3 to 2) on that ship section. If you use the last resource, remove the die from the ship section.&#10;&#10;Then the hidden dice of both players are revealed. Whoever has the highest total is the winner of that skirmish. The loser should move their damage rating marker down one skull icon to the left on their ship. The loser then becomes the next Attacker. In the event of a tie, neither player loses any damage rating points and the Defender becomes the next Attacker.&#10;&#10;If your damage rating marker ever is moved to the Tail Section, your ship has been disabled and you are out of the battle.&#10;&#10;Play until one person is victorious.&#10;&#10;"

It takes roughly 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;The basic idea is that players are exploring an archipelago in search of islands. The game board consists of a 9&times;9 array of 81 squares, further divided into nine 3&times;3 boxes. There are 18 islands total, but these islands aren&rsquo;t distributed randomly; instead, they are arranged so that two islands occupy each 3&times;3 box, each row, and each column.  What's more, these islands are initially hidden from view.&#10;&#10;Players claim one square per turn.  A player either places an island of her color in the region (if there's an island there) or a boat of her color in the region (if there isn't).  Players are trying first to discover and then to connect together as many islands as they can:  the more islands they connect together, the more points they receive at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players use logic to determine where the islands are likely to be, but logic alone is not enough:  players must also think tactically and strategically in order both to foster their own growth and limit the growth of their opponents.&#10;&#10;ScatterLand takes no more than five minutes to learn (or to teach), but its gameplay is surprisingly deep.  There are a lot of things to try to balance when deciding where to play:  do you want to claim a new island as your own or try to connect two of your islands together?  Do you want to try to consolidate your own position or be the first to explore a given area? Do you want to focus on expanding your chains or trying to cut off your opponents?&#10;&#10;Two versions of the game are included:  the basic version (described above) and the advanced version (which limits the number of exclusive islands any one player can claim).&#10;&#10;ScatterLand can be found at http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/ -- just click the links toward the bottom of the page for both the rules and 20 additional boards.&#10;&#10;"

Advertised as &quot;The Fastest, Most Realistic Baseball Game in the World,&quot; it uses a plastic ballpark with a &quot;pitcher,&quot; &quot;batter,&quot; and &quot;catcher.&quot; The batting player uses the &quot;batter&quot; (a small metal bat attached to a spring that swings like a bat when a button is pushed) to hit a small metal ball from the &quot;pitcher&quot; (a set of three levers controlled by the pitching player that pitches the ball toward the plate and controls it) before it lands in the &quot;catcher&quot; (a pit behind home plate.)&#10;&#10;If the ball is put into play, it may land in a cup, stay in the ballpark, go foul, or be hit outside. Various cups are labeled as to the result, which may be an out or an extra-base hit. If the ball is still inbounds but not in a cup, it is a single. If it leaves the ballpark, then it is a homerun.&#10;&#10;The controls of the pitcher allow the ball to be shot forth at varying speeds, moved with a magnet beneath the playing field, and dropped through a trapdoor so the batter is unable to hit it. The game rules describe six different &quot;pitches&quot; that can be thrown: a fastball, change-up, curveball, screwball, slider, and sinker. The game revolves around this element of the pitcher/hitter struggle. While it is very difficult to hit any pitch but a fastball or change-up, if the batter does not swing at anything else it is a ball, as in baseball. Various deceptions by the pitcher can be employed, such as opening the trapdoor while the ball is approaching the bat then closing it at the last moment so it will be a strike.&#10;&#10;"
