Hundreds of years in the future, scientific advances have given humans control over the power behind the elemental forces of nature: Fire, Water, Wind and Earth.

The strongest representatives of each generation participate in a galactic tournament once a year called the Elementa Arcanum -- a spectacle so mesmerizing it surpassed the Olympics and rendered it obsolete.  As the years pass, the most talented of each generation slowly begin to emerge until a victor is declared.

Players alternate between Combat Turns, where they vie for Stars (Victory Points) and Research Turns where players can improve and optimize their decks.  The first player to 5 Stars wins the game.  The rules are relatively simple and can be taught to newcomers while the game is underway through the &quot;Teaching Game&quot; system.  The game has a very small form-factor and is highly portable.

Eight months later the Bolsheviks stood at the helm. They were little known to anybody when the year began, and their leaders were still under indictment for state treason when they came to power. You will not find another such sharp turn in history especially if you remember that it involves a nation of 150 million people...' &#10;             Leon Trotsky, History of the Russian Revolutions&#10;&#10;The Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is a social-political conflict game for 2 to 5 players. In the game, players take on the role of one of five factions (Monarchists, Octobrists, Cadets (Constitutional Democrats), Left Reformists, or the Revolutionary Left) active in the events of the Russian Revolutions of 1917. Some factions begin the game as Governing factions with state power; others as the opposition. Whatever your factions, you will need to build your political influence, maintain your military power, manage alliances with other factions, and protect Russia from foreign invaders. The winner of the game is the faction that gains state power, and uses that effectively to change Russian society as its ideology dictates.&#10;&#10;The game is played on two boards, one depicting the European part of Russia, the other representing St. Petersburg/ Petrograd (Russia's capital city and the 'cradle of the revolution'). Political influence is represented by coloured blocks; a vast range of historical leaders as well as military units (with historical designations) are represented by colourful double-sided chits.&#10;&#10;The game uses an innovative system in which player either spend 'action points' to take actions or to buy cards, and thereby gain influence among various significant institutions, organisations, and social groups which can be used in later turns. Historical events are affect play as they are drawn from time-tiered event decks. New cards are added to these decks as certain conditions are met in game play.&#10;&#10;Unlike most political games, the Russian Revolutions: 1914-21 is  very suitable for solitaire play. There is little hidden information and, while alliances between factions is an important part of play, these alliances are formed and broken automatically as the ideological position of you faction changes through the game. That means there is no need for long breaks in play where players 'negotiate' and scheme - all your scheming will happen on the board.         &#10;&#10;&#10;"

The most common ways to use the AP are moving troops around the board and using a combination of AP and skill cards to build something on a terrain tile which represents a piece of land. For instance, if you're on a river tile and you have the correct skill card (in this case the Engineer skill card) you can build a bridge across the river (you flip the tile over and the river becomes a bridge). Then you put your land control cube on the tile to mark that you own it.&#10;&#10;The game ends for a specific player if they run out of troops. Troops can be lost in battles.

Then they must ask any player for a number and type of card, seeking to build a set of 4 with the ones he already owns.&#10;&#10;Now, the player who was asked has two options:&#10;&#10;     If he possesses one or more of that number and type, he must give it to him.&#10;     If he does not have any cards of the type sought, he must answer: Fly!&#10;&#10;&#10;The requesting player will then remove a card from the garden.&#10;&#10;     If the card obtained from the garden matches the one you requested earlier, you must show it to the rest of the players and you can continue asking the others.&#10;     If it does not match, it will be the turn of the player to his right.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a player gathers 3 cards of the same type and number, he will place them face up to one side.

Take another card from the pot.&#10;     If the Queen is not lowered, you cannot go down beehive games or honey ladder, but you can go down a bouquet or flower ladder.&#10;    If you can't do any of the above, you must pass.&#10;&#10;&#10;The next player on the right follows, always taking a card from the pot and placing it next to their cards. On their turn, the player is entitled to perform any of the actions above or:&#10;&#10;     Add a letter or more to a ladder, or complete a bouquet or beehive on the table.&#10;     Draw a card from a game for another player that does not make it lose its status as a bouquet, hive or ladder, and use the drawn card to open a new game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when one of the players closes by lowering all his cards.
