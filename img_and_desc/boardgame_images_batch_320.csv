The aim of the game is to leave the bar as rich as possible.&#10;&#10;A round starts by turning a card. On this card you see a number of lines (maximum 4). The players have to decide to leave the bar with the current earnings or to turn a new card. When they turn a card there is a risk of being thrown out of the bar if all the lines on the cards are broken. As long as there is one line that starts on the first card and ends on the last card without any interruptions in between they can stay in the bar to continue stealing.&#10;&#10;You can also turn a card that shows a guard. As soon as two guards are turned the exits of the bar are blocked. In this way it is impossible to leave the bar. There are also a few other cards available to add some variation to the game.&#10;&#10;The game is played in several rounds. Each round you have to decide how much risk you are willing to take. Timing and luck are very important.&#10;&#10;

Each player has a unique deck of cards that &ldquo;drives&rdquo; nearly all game procedures. One player controls the forces of the British Crown &ndash; regular battalions of the Royal Army, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), its elite Auxiliary Division, and the English &ldquo;Black &amp; Tans&rdquo; who filled the RIC&rsquo;s vacant ranks as native Irish policemen resigned from the force.&#10;&#10;MAP: Map depicts all of Ireland divided into 16 different regions (plus Dublin)&#10;SCALE: Operational. Turns are bi-monthly. Irish units represent 12-100 men. British units are army battalions, auxiliary police companies, and local constabulary.&#10;COMPONENTS: Two decks of 55 cards each, 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map, 280 &frac12;&rdquo; counters, 77 5/8&rdquo; counters, 24 page rulebook, and 3 player aid cards.&#10;COMPLEXITY: Medium. Somewhere between We the People and Wilderness War.&#10;&#10;Each card in the Crown Player&rsquo;s deck may be played for 5 different purposes:&#10;&#10;1) To conduct Operations with a number of units determined by the card&rsquo;s value. These can be Patrols that aim to &ldquo;show the flag&rdquo; and catch the foe unawares; small-scale Raids to capture known or suspected Republican activists; and large-scale military Roundups intended to encircle and trap guerrilla units.&#10;&#10;2) To cause an Event, of which there are many different types, including: Army Reinforcements, Blockade, Spies, Black &amp; Tans, Motorization, Armored Cars, Mass Arrests, the RAF, and various new laws &ndash; just to name a few.&#10;&#10;3) To recruit an Informer in one of the three regions listed on the card. These greatly boost the effectiveness of local Crown operations &ndash; and impede the activities of Republican guerrillas.&#10;&#10;Crown forces other than the Irish-born RIC may take revenge for guerrilla attacks and the generally hostile attitude of the natives by destroying civilian property. Such &lsquo;reprisals&rsquo; can play a significant role in eroding both the British and Irish peoples&rsquo; will to continue the struggle.&#10;&#10;"

Competition among the players for goods and army strength is relative rather than linear; having twice as many dudes collecting resources won&rsquo;t net you twice the number of goods, so getting into an arms race with one opponent might hurt the two of you together and advantage the third player who can spend resources on better things.&#10;&#10;Controlling different cities gives you different bonuses, with the bonus being based on the history of the city itself: Sippar lets you trade more, Babylon counts for additional armies, and so forth. Combat in the game is dice-based to avoid deterministic battles in which you can guarantee victory simply by piling up more troops, although size does have its advantages.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Like Wallace's other games Libert&eacute; and Byzantium, players don't represent a particular faction/nation. Instead, the game covers a long period of history (~1500 years in this case) and players temporarily control empires as they rise and fall. Score VP at the end of each turn (~350 years) when the empires fall. Players start with several resources and 2 workers in their available stock, and workers in the irrigation and weaving boxes. Each turn follows the same steps:1. Collect Resources (grain and textiles) based on relative rank of workers in the irrigation/weaving. Then take 8 workers to available stock (total 10 at start of game). Move all workers in Scribes and Toolmakers to the left (and &quot;Unused&quot;) side.&#10;&#10;2. Decline (turns 2 and 4 ONLY): each player removes all workers from Dilmun, and 1 from every non-Sumerian region. In the Irrigation and Weaving boxes, the player with the most workers reduces their number TO 2 (with n being the number of workers they returned to supply). The other players remove n workers. Finally, each removes 1 worker from the Scribes and Toolmakers boxes.&#10;&#10;3. Player Actions. In turn order (random at start of game), take 1 action. If anyone has passed, you must discard one item (resource, worker, or army) from your available stock to take an action. Continue rotating in turn order till all 3 pass. Action Choices:&#10;- Build City. Place one of your city markers in Sumerian region with no other city there. Most give you a special power. If all 4 out, may destroy old city to build new one.&#10;- Place Workers. Spend a resource of value x; place up to x workers in ONE location (Scribe box: max 2 workers/player). In addition, or instead, may use each unused scribe to move or place a worker.&#10;- Trade. Each worker is allowed to trade 1 resource for 1 of the resource(s) available in their region. Each region only provides 1 of each resource present there. However, if ANY army is in the region, workers cannot do anything. Each army, though, can conduct 1 trade just like a worker. In addition, or instead, you can use worker(s) in the Toolmakers box to convert metal to Tools (1/worker).&#10;- Start Empire. 3 available each turn, 1/player. Each has designated start region (2 Sumerian empires -- may start anywhere in Sumer). You must have equal or greater number of workers than any other single player in their home region (except Sumerian empires: no workers needed). Take designated # armies into available stock; may buy more (pay resource(s)). Also, may equip (spend resources; rank by value relative to what other already created empires spent). Then come onto board: if enemy army there, fight. Otherwise (or once enemy killed), place 1 or 2 armies in starting region.&#10;- Expand Empire.&#10;... [i]Place Army[/i] token (from available stock) to adjacent region. If enemy army present, fight.&#10;... [i]Destroy City[/i]. If have army in region with enemy city, discard 2 from supply to destroy it -- return to supply.&#10;... [i]Reinforce Region[/i]: place 2nd army into a region (max 2/region).&#10;... After any choice above, may discard 1 army from supply to Expand again.&#10;Fighting&#10;Attacker rolls 2d6. If better equipped than defender, kills on 5+. Otherwise, need 7+. May continue attacking until decide to end battle, or win and place 1 army in new region (all considered 1 attack; i.e., don't need to discard an army to continue the fight).&#10;- Pass. May opt to discard resource(s) as well.&#10;&#10;4. Determine Turn Order. Based on resources discarded when passing: most--&gt;least first--&gt;third. If tied, retain relative turn order.&#10;&#10;5. Score VP. 2VP/region with your army token. Then in turn order, decide whether or not to improve your cities: each requires discarding 2 wood + 0-4 resources (earn 3-18 VP). If improved, place marker on city -- it won't score again.&#10;&#10;6. Reset. Remove all armies from board. Remove all armies and workers from available stock. Advance turn marker.&#10;&#10;End of Game&#10;- After end of turn 5.&#10;- Final scoring: player with most [i]workers[/i] in each region scores VP shown on board.&#10;- Most VP wins. Tiebreaker = turn order.&#10;&#10;"

The Speedway Racing  board game gives you 'big time stock car auto racing' and 'live event track action' for true, behind the wheel racing experiences.&#10;&#10;At the Drivers Meeting, you will receive your Drivers Handbook and will learn the rules of the race.&#10;With one to five drivers, choose your favorite car, then 'start your engines'. Drivers race their cars around the oval track based on a roll of the dice. There are Bonus Points in the game. If you are lucky enough to roll doubles or other combinations imprinted, on the Speedway Racing game board, you will accelerate your advancement around the track.&#10;&#10;During the Driver's meeting, you also learn that this will be a fast paced, five-lap competition. You will be driving against other highly competitive opponents. There are many Challenges and Pitfalls ahead of you as you speed around the track to take your car, to the coveted &quot;Winner Circle&quot;, of Speedway Racing's board game.&#10;&#10;Before you begin, choose Option 1, for the first driver to cross the finish line. Or, Option 2, in case all drivers are 'stacked up' and trying to cross the finish line. One last roll of the dice will determine the winner. You must choose Option 1 or Option 2, before the race begins.&#10;&#10;The Race is Underway! Of course, the object of the game is to win the race, but beware; there are advantages and obstacles as you thunder around the track.&#10;&#10;Hit the &quot;Pit Stop&quot; Zone or the &quot;Speedway Challenge&quot; Zone and adjust your position based on the events of each opportunity. Hit the wall and you suffer the consequences, in your quest. If you can avoid an accident, you will advance your position on the track.&#10;&#10;Take care in selecting your pit crew. Many track advantages will depend on the timing, action and reaction speed of your pit crew.A driver can pilot the race car, but the pit crew will make the crucial difference in the outcome of the victory.&#10;    &#10;As in real speedway racing, your pit crew is vital! The Speedway Racing Board Game track graphics are beautifully illustrated. The game's race cars are authentic 1:144 scale die-cast metal with moving wheels.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Challenge&quot; cards and &quot;Pit Stop&quot; cards are&#10;realistic 'during the race' events. As you position your car and maneuver around the track, you will encounter cars hitting the wall, track debris, flat tires and yellow flags.&#10;&#10;Caution Flags Are Out! Beware of Hazards!!&#10;&#10;White-knuckle rookie drivers could hit the car in front of them, have stalled engines or make serious driving errors, while lapped traffic slows you down. The events of the &quot;Speedway Racing&quot; board game will impact the sheer adrenaline rush of moving forward, as you concentrate, on the coveted first place win. As you cross the Finish Line, move your car into the &quot;Winner's Circle&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each game contains a highly detailed graphic game board, five 1:144 scale die-cast cars with moving wheels, drivers challenge cards, dice and directions, in a re-usable bag. Family board game enthusiasts may want to have multiple games for their weekly or monthly family board game night.&#10;&#10;The rules, of this family board game, are easy enough for the youngest race fans, but challenging enough, to keep you and the other drivers ever watchful on the track.&#10;&#10;"
