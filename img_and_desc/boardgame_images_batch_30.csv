However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.&#10;&#10;There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.&#10;&#10;Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.&#10;&#10;The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.&#10;&#10;In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.&#10;&#10;The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more. Players can be eliminated from the game prior to the game's end.&#10;&#10;"

3485,,"Anno Domini is a wargame for four players and consists of a map board, a deck of cards, 12 dice, cardboard coins, miniature castles and cathedrals and a rule book.&#10;&#10;Players start by randomly selecting a Pope and proceeding with the random selection of all 36 territories. These are claimed by placing a castle and cathedral on the specified area of the map board.&#10;&#10;Play commences with the Administrative Phase where players collect taxes based on the number of territories and cathedrals they control. Following is the Military phase that is divided into three optional steps. The first is to roll 2d6 for a random event that will cause the player to either gain or lose money, lose cards, lose castles or become the pope. The second option is to build new castles on your territories. The final is an attack on another person's territory.&#10;&#10;Territories can attack adjacent territories or those on the same body of water. The attacking and defensive force are determined by the number of castles on each territory. For each castle on his/her territory, the attacker and defenders each roll a die and apply any modifiers obtained by cathedrals or cards in his/her possession. Results of 6 or over destroy a castle of the opposing side. If all of the defenders castles are lost, the attacker wins the territory, places a castle to claim it and may draw a card at the end of the phase. Cards offer various benefits such as money, attack/defence points or game actions.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player controls 8 cathedrals.&#10;&#10;... and apparently the castles are cute.&#10;&#10;"

The game has been copied by many companies since and is the most widely available of all 3D Chess boards.&#10;&#10;The most famous variant of 3D Chess appeared in the Star Trek television show in 1966, in which it was referred to as 'Three Dimensional Chess'.&#10;The original stage property was designed by Irving A Feinberg and consisted of three 4x4 boards and four movable 2x2 boards.&#10;It was developed into a real game by the technical designer Franz Joseph Schnaubelt in his 1975 book, the Star Fleet Technical Manual and improved by a fan and chess player Andrew Bartmess, whose rules are some of the most popular.&#10;Fans of Star Trek still call it 'Three Dimensional Chess' but players of the game call it by the title Schnaubelt popularised 'Tri Dimensional Chess'.&#10;&#10;In 1985, the game design Gary Gygax published rules for Dragon Chess in Dragon magazine.&#10;A Dragon Chess board is three 8x12 boards stacked up and includes the extra pieces: Sylph, Griffon, Dragon, Warrior, Oliphant, Unicorn, Hero, Thief, Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Dwarf, Basilisk and Elemental.&#10;&#10;Max Chappell started designing Hyperchess in the early '70s but didn't produce and sell the first commercial set until 1996.&#10;Although it was influenced by the tri dimensional chess board, it has been described as more helical in design.&#10;&#10;In 2001 William d&#039;Agostino recreated the Strato Chess board and called it Millenium Chess, with the idea of extending Classic Chess, whithout distorting the game.&#10;&#10;"

A player chooses between one of four actions on his turn:  Moving his pawn on the board via die roll; military fortification of a previously influenced country; military response to another player's prior coup d'etat against a non-fortified country; or attempt an invasion of a non-fortified country.  The game centers around keeping other players' military influence markers out of strategically valued countries, and installing your own influence and subsequent fortifications in same.  Once a country has military fortifications installed, it is immune from all further actions.  Unfortunately for the warmongers, world opinion is constantly being lowered by hostile actions, and propaganda efforts must be maintained to keep world opinion high enough for successful actions.  Of course, before you can militarily influence anybody, you have to get economic influence going, and the various spaces on the board track take care of giving everybody opportunity for same.&#10;&#10;"

The game's namesake, for example, appears in the Mark 1 and Mark V versions only.&#10;It uses a simplified system for maneuver and combat that emphasizes game play over realism, and is very playable. Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.&#10;A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.&#10;Play set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!&#10;&#10;"
