The land was rich and the people prosperous. Out of their wealth a great temple was constructed, puissant magical items created and many fantastic beasts imported from faraway lands. But as is the way of all things, eventually the king grew old and passed on from this mortal plane.  &#10;His son inherited his realm and magical talent but not his wisdom. Greedy and grasping, searching for greater treasures and power than even his father had amassed, he reached past the limits set by the gods and opened a rift into a dimension of primal chaos. The once prosperous realm was sucked in and lost for millennia.  &#10;But now a new magic portal has opened leading to that mystic realm, or at least to what that realm has become. Overrun by monsters, the few remaining inhabitants are oppressed. The once-great temple is overgrown, the capital city lost in a jungle teeming with cannibals and wild beasts. But golden treasures and powerful magic items still remain, waiting for brave adventurers to discover. &#10;And the greedy prince? He too, remains. Preserved by his wicked magic, he is now an undead master, the Liche Lord. Still ruling the ruined kingdom from his father&rsquo;s throne, his only remaining desire to suck the life force from the bones of anyone foolish enough to enter his kingdom.

And are you clever enough to return with the fame, fortune and treasures of a lifetime? &#10;Mystic Realm is a one to ten player game of adventure set in a fantasyland.

Their only hope is to exploit the dim-witted intelligences of their converted brothers and sisters to evade total destruction. Only through surviving the Torac reactions to scavenge the ruins of their destroyed civilization can they hope to evict the invaders.

The best chance humanity has at removing the Torac (and winning the game) is to scavenge the ruins across the globe.&#10;&#10;However, should the Torac annihilate the human presence on Earth, then their intention to convert Earth into their new homeworld will succeed unabated.

The starting player places one piece on either his/her territory, (the 13 squares in front of him/her) or on his/her opponent's territory (the 13 squares in front of the opponent). Both players then take turns placing pieces on the board. Once on the board, the pieces remain in the some place throughout the whole game. Towers are consisting of single pieces or several pieces piled on top of each other.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE TOWERSThe Towers are built with a minimum of one and a maximum of 4 pieces. Each piece in an individual Tower must have different sizes and colours. The Towers belong to the player whose territory they are built on. A player can for example choose to place a Tower on his/her opponent's territory to undermine the strength of the opponent's Towers: this Tower belongs to the opponent.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE CONFRONTATIONSTowers confront each other when they are aligned, whether diagonally or frontally. There can be 7 frontal alignments and 6 diagonal ones. When one player has got 2 of his/her Towers on a same alignment, only the strongest one can enter a confrontation.&#10;If none of his/her opponent's Towers are aligned with his/hers, then there is no confrontation. An individual Tower can be involved in 2 different confrontations simultaneously, (one on a diagonal, the other on a frontal alignment). Both confrontations are then solved separately. In order to solve a conflict, the strengths of the Towers need to be assessed.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;HOW STRONG ARE THE TOWERS?The strength of a Tower depends on the size of its highest piece. The pieces can have 5 different sizes, hence the strength of a Tower can vary from I to 5. Whatever its number of pieces, only the highest will account for the strength of a Tower. For example, a two-piece Tower can win over a four-piece Tower. There is however one exception to this rule: one-piece Towers will always lose to higher Towers. When the highest pieces of two confronting Towers are of equal strength, then the piece that comes immediately under it is assessed and so on until the confrontation is resolved.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE MONOLITHS (&quot;TRUMPETS&quot;)Monoliths are used to visualize which of the 2 players (at any stage in the game) has got the upper hand. Each time a player wins a confrontation, he/she is given a Monolith to position on his/her side of the board, on the triangle corresponding to the alignment where the confrontation just took place. The monolith remains with the player as long as he/she is a leader. However, if the opponent gets the upper hand then he /she is given the Monolith to place on his/her side of the board. When there is no obvious leader, the monolith is removed altogether from the board.&#10;A Tower can be involved in two different confrontations, hence a player can win, or lose, 2 Monoliths at once.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;HOW TO WIN?The player who wins his/her seventh monolith and does not lose it over to his/her opponent in the immediate next turn, wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;THE ASYMMETRY RULEA player cannot copy the move of his/her opponent by positioning immediately after him/her an identical piece (same size and colour) on the same alignment and at a same level of an identical Tower. At least one of these parameters must differ.&#10;&#10;"

Each player takes a set of four coloured chips with stickers depicting children of different races and places them on the starting positions at four corners of the island. The object of the game is to move these pieces one step at a time to link them up in a diamond shape or in a straight line. Along the way, there are spaces marked with a star that act as barriers. If a player's piece lands on one of these starred spaces, an opponent takes a card from a stack of cards bearing questions about ethnic customs, festivals or practices in Singapore and asks the player the question. If the player answers correctly, the piece is allowed to remain on the starred space, otherwise it must return to the space it had just moved from.&#10;&#10;The game was first printed in 1992.

74023,,"This is a game that's somewhat of a fusion between Axis and Allies and Risk, finding a relatively simple-to-play compromise.  It plays across a game map that is territory-intensive in Europe and East Asia, with Africa and North America trailing along as close seconds.  The setup is abstractly accurate to the situations of the five powers (Nazi Germany, Empire of Japan, British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and the United States) around the end of 1939 (with a few liberties taken in South America), and features neutral nations (That Japan, Germany, and Russia can attack), vassal-like allied nations (especially prevalent with Britain and Germany), capitol cities, key cities, research facilities, tanks, bombers, oil, and unique special abilities for each nation.  The objectives encourage playing across the entire map, instead of just Europe, and in fact might be more advantageous to do so.&#10;&#10;Summary of National Situations:&#10;&#10;1) Nazi Germany: Having taken Czechoslovakia, Austria, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Poland, and France; and supported by its allies in Vichy France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary; the Nazi-aligned forces are poised to strike at Greece, Britain, and the Soviet Union (though the latter two are incredibly tough battles).  It has been recently brought to the attention of high command that the British-aligned forces have been building in North Africa, however, and Hitler has ordered Rommel there to advance the African front and take Libya and Egypt.  (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)&#10;&#10;2) Empire of Japan: Having annexed Taiwan and Korea, set up its puppet government in Manchukuo, and advanced down through Northern China, the Japanese Empire suddenly finds itself cut off from trade with the United States, a prime source of its oil.  The Japanese do have some reserve oil remaining, however, and if used sparingly, might be able to last until the Empire can secure its own sources.  There is much debate on whether Japan should declare war on America, and there is much incentive to do so, but there are some who believe that focusing on conquering China and British-dominated Southeast Asia might be a better strategy in the long run, and others still who believe the Soviet Union is an easier target. (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)&#10;&#10;3) The British Commonwealth: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom and its colonies have all declared war on Nazi Germany.  Commonwealth and British troops alike have poured into the battlefields of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as moved in support of British-dominated Southeast Asia and India.  The British Commonwealth also keeps a wary eye across the Pacific to the expanding Japanese Empire, hoping that their Chinese allies can hold off the insatiable Asian power long enough for the Commonwealth to get its bearings.  Sir Winston Churchill meanwhile petitions the United States to join them...&#10;&#10;4) The Soviet Union: Having seen the rapid expansion and great success of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union now seeks to expand its own borders.  The obvious choice is Finland, but Persia and Turkey to the south also seem inviting.  The success or failure of the Soviet Union rests on its ability to conquer and annex territory in much the same manner as Germany, and thus be able to display a strong showing against the remaining great powers of the world.&#10;&#10;5) United States: Haunted by the spectre of the first Great War and rifled with its own domestic problems in the Great Depression, the American people want to stay out of the European War altogether, despite having become the protectors of Iceland.  President Roosevelt sees the danger of a Nazi-controlled Europe, but is having a difficult time convincing Congress of his views.  Although America could possibly get involved in the war on its own, it seems likely that the only thing that could draw the Americans is a direct attack against the United States.  However, there is a more definitive resolve to intervene if the war comes to the Americas... (Note: in a 3 or 4 player game, America is controlled by the British player, who keeps attempting to rouse the sleeping great power against Germany and Japan)&#10;&#10;"

Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Africa, Scramble for Africa includes two scenarios, one historical and one hypothetical, each playable in under two hours. Complexity is easy (about 2/10).&#10;&#10;Play is determined by the triangular grid, which is superimposed over a map of Africa.  The points at which the lines of the grid intersect determine the placement of pieces on the game board in a manner similar to the game of go.  A player action consists of placing one control marker on the map, often in conjunction with moving an army (if in play), playing an event chit, and/or drawing an event chit from the randomizer cup. Event chits add random elements to the game, and include discoveries, diplomatic events, resources, or encounters with native populations. The object of the game is to acquire the most Victory Points, primarily by surrounding and controlling spaces in a manner similar to the game of go.  At the end of the game, players receive Victory Points for their positions on the board, and for resources controlled.  This is added to VP's accumulated for discoveries accumulated during the course of the game.  The player with the greatest score, obviously, is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The assumption is, when Hitler ordered his army to march into the Rhineland, the Allied powers, instead of appeasing him, ordered their armed forces to resist. The ensuing chain of events leads to the war expanding throughout Europe. A war fought at that time would&rsquo;ve found all European militaries woefully unprepared.&#10;&#10;Central to the play of the game are its &ldquo;crisis chits.&rdquo; They represent various diplomatic and military events that could bring other powers into the war. Players pick crisis chits depending on the number of crisis hexes (printed on the map) they control. The more such hexes they control, the greater the chances they have of gaining more allies. At the same time, grabbing too much territory can lead to political collapse at home, as domestic foes work to undermine your power before the conflict explodes into a wider war.&#10;&#10;Rhineland Crisis War is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries that choose to align with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one month. Units of maneuver are corps and armies.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover: crises, political collapse, reinforcements, replacements, terror bombing, railroads, fog of war, airpower, naval and amphibious operations, weather, neutrals, the Soviet Union, armistice and surrender, the Spanish Civil War, expeditionary forces, airborne units, air transport, fifth columns, alpine units, and anti-aircraft units. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. Axis Player Turn&#10; A. Axis Mobilization Phase&#10; B. Axis Terror Bombing Phase&#10; C. Axis Movement Phase&#10; D. Axis Combat Phase&#10; E. Axis Rally Phase&#10; F. Axis Crisis Phase&#10;II. Allied Player Turn&#10; A. Allied Mobilization Phase&#10; B. Allied Terror Bombing Phase&#10; C. Allied Movement Phase&#10; D. Allied Combat Phase&#10; E. Allied Rally Phase.&#10; F. Allied Crisis Phase&#10;III. End of Turn Phase&#10;&#10;"

The winner is the first side to have all characters reach the final space - the Power Sword.&#10;&#10;"

Players spend these dice to purchase and complete rail contracts, deliver cargo, and improve their companies&rsquo; competitive abilities. Who can build the best rail network and deliver the most profitable goods? Get rolling and find out!&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with a pool of six dice with multi-colored sides. On each turn, a player can spend his or her dice to purchase contracts, construct rail links, build switching stations, purchase improvements and deliver one cargo of passengers or freight. Unused dice can be converted into stockpile markers for future use. By purchasing improvements, players can gain more dice with special abilities, become more efficient at laying rail or stockpiling dice, or increase the points they receive when other players deliver cargo over their rails. Bonus points are awarded for delivering passengers quickly or delivering freight over long distances.&#10;&#10;The large, two-sided, colorful board has two maps. The western U.S. map, from the California gold rush era, is designed for 2 &ndash; 4 players. With many double-track routes, this map allows newer players to effectively plan their networks and maximize deliveries. The southeastern U.S. map, depicting the late Nineteenth Century, has only single-track routes that are significantly interwoven. This provides more advanced strategic options and is intended for 3 &ndash; 5 experienced players.&#10;&#10;"

The inspiration comes from the popular literature of the time with an emphasis on the classic thematic elements.&#10;&#10;There are three different types of magic users to add to your army:  Druids, Shamans, and Sorcerers.  Each gets 10 spell points to chose from the 25 available spells (cost 1-4 points each) but is limited thematically to what they may chose.  Adding a magic user to your army is expensive however, costing roughly the same point value as a Dragon, Giant, or a Commanding General.&#10;&#10;Twenty different classic monsters are created for your army by following a simple template system.  Here is an example of how to get stats for a goblin character by making conversions to your normal miniatures rules:&#10;&#10;Goblins:&#10;Fight as:  Light, medium or light-medium infantry only.&#10;Movement:  As designated troop type.&#10;Frontage:  As designated troop type.&#10;Special:  Like Orcs, Goblins loose one morale grade for reaction test purposes in bright sunlight.&#10;Limits:  No more than one Goblin unit in an army may be designated as elite.

Alchemists want to create gold, but they never could figure out how to create gold, so instead the players are fighting over a single gold coin by alternating turns making new combinations of elements.  When on a player&rsquo;s turn no new combinations are possible, that player loses the round.  The first player to win two rounds in a row wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
