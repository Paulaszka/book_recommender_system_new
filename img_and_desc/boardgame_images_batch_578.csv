Players represent the highest rungs of European monarchy, assuming the leadership of a major European Power, and struggling to achieve global supremacy over the world in the Age of Absolutism. Being an absolute monarch, each player must manage every kind of question: economic, political, diplomacy, trade, world wide exploration, colonization, religion and warfare.&#10;&#10;Age of Monarchs is designed to offer an accurate and detailed historical context, supported by more than 160 strategy cards that simulate the most outstanding historical events and force players to face constantly the toughest challenges that occurred during the three centuries covered by the game timeline.&#10;&#10;The game offers a wide set of short scenarios and a Grand Campaign 1492-1789, spanning 20 turns, that put the most powerful European nations into a never-ending struggle for world domination.&#10;&#10;The complete list of Scenarios:&#10;&#10;&bull; 1492-1559 Age of Exploration&#10;&bull; 1560-1618 Wars of Religion&#10;&bull; 1619-1667 Thirty Years War&#10;&bull; 1668-1730 Age of Absolutism&#10;&bull; 1698-1789 Wars of Supremacy&#10;&#10;In Age of Monarchs players take the role of the absolute monarch of a Major Power. Monarchs are represented by Strategy Cards that reproduce historical characters (plus some generic ones), each with special abilities that affect game rules. The game manages also the aging of monarchs, and their replacement by new monarchs, crowned after their predecessor is dead, thus allowing players to handle a line of succession in the monarchy of their Powers.&#10;&#10;Strategy Cards are the core of the game. They provide Command Points that allow players to perform all Game Actions, but they also introduce the most outstanding historical events of the Modern Age, such as the Protestant Reformation, the Wars of Religion, the birth of Holland (United Provinces), the Eighty Years war with Spain, the rise and decline of the Portuguese and Spanish colonial empires, the Thirty Years War, the rush of the Russian Empire to Siberia, the Great Northern Wars, the growth of the Ottoman Empire, the wars with Christianity, the Wars of Succession, the birth of the USA, and many more.&#10;&#10;Game Actions allow players to perform activities in all spheres. To summarize a few:&#10;&#10;Warfare: the game has a light military system. Players can rapidly move or redeploy forces, engage land battles, resolve sieges and naval combats. Supply mechanics are very simple. Leaders play a fundamental role in game-play, either as Generals, Admirals or Conquistadors.&#10;Diplomacy: many Minor Nations are present in the game. All players can influence these Minors to get Alliances and Vassals, benefiting from their military support during conflicts.&#10;Exploration, Colonization and Trade: the game recreates the race of the Powers to build Colonial Empires all over the world. New colonies bring income from the exploitation of exotic resources and gold. The game allows players to affect the prices of exotic goods in order to speculate on price fluctuations as well. Gold can have a strong impact on the European economy due to Inflation!&#10;Economy: players must pay attention to the budget of their Powers. At the end of each turn, players perform some short and rapid calculations to determine the budget balance of their Monarchies, based on revenues (taxes, colonial incomes, trade) and costs (maintenance of forces). The game has also the concept of Prosperity, measuring the richness of each Power, strongly affected by the length and outcome of wars.&#10;&#10;Game overview:&#10;&#10;&bull; Complexity: 6 / 10&#10;&bull; Game length: 5+ hours&#10;&bull; Number of players: 3-6&#10;&bull; Time scale: about 10 years per turn&#10;&bull; Solitaire suitability: low&#10;&#10;"

If there are at least the number of animals that the previous player claimed, the doubter takes all the cards (which are worth negative points); if not, the person who made the claim collects them. But beware as the deck contains special cards &mdash; e.g., jokers that count as any animal and cards that reduce the number of animals seen &mdash; so no one can ever be sure which animals await.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect thirty cards loses and ends the game, then the player with the fewest cards wins.&#10;&#10;"

Position the Flagship in tactical orbit! And reconfigure that Battlestation into something new! Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.&#10;&#10;In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.&#10;&#10;Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.&#10;&#10;You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.&#10;&#10;With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.&#10;&#10;Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.&#10;&#10;"

The deck is made of a count up/count down card, four different colored links numbering 1-12 in each color, and flip cards.  The first person to play all their cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are five short rules for the game.  &#10;1) Never play a card that has the same color as the top card in the chain.  &#10;2) If Count Up is facing up, the value of your card must be higher than the top card of the chain, unless you play a Flip card.  Likewise, if Count Down is facing up, the value of your card must be smaller than the top card of the chain, unless you play a Flip.  &#10;3) The three ways to flip the Count Down / Count Up card is to play a 1, play a 12, or play a flip.  If you play a 1 this flips the Count Down card to Count Up.  Play a 12 and the Count Up card to Count Down.  If you play a Flip, the Count Up / Count Down card to the opposite side.  &#10;4) When a Flip is played, the color of the Flip is what is used for Rule #1, and the value of the card under the Flip is the value you use for Rule #2 depending on what side the Count Up / Count Down is face up.  &#10;5)  If you can not play a card, draw one from the draw pile.  If you can play the card drawn, do so, if not play passes to the next person.  If there are no more cards to draw from shuffle all but the last two cards of the chain up and make them the draw deck.&#10;&#10;"

If during this building period, you play a specialist that no other player has in hand, you may use both abilities on that card; if two or more players play the same specialist, each of them may use only one of the two abilities. Exploiting the abilities of these specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings, which come in three types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Processing buildings&#10;    &quot;Immediate&quot; buildings with a one-time effect &#10;    Buildings that provide bonus points at the end of the game for various accomplishments&#10;&#10;&#10;Mastering the balance of knowing the best specialist card to play and being flexible about when you play it &mdash; together with assembling a clever combination of buildings &mdash; is the key to this game.&#10;&#10;The 2021 edition of Glass Road includes previously released promotional material: the Oktoberfest and Adventskalender tiles and the Harlekin card for use in the solitaire version of the game.&#10;&#10;"

No story here. Just tighten your shoes, race, and be prepared for a nail biting finish. RoShamBo Rush was designed to be quick paced and to keep all players in the game with its system of catch-up logic. There is a very small learning curve, making it a great game to introduce newcomers to table top gaming.&#10;&#10;As the name implies, Rock-Paper-Scissors is a large part of the game. Players duel each other using a set of cards that remain in each players possession throughout the game. Banter is encouraged. It is a good way to solicit a tell from your opponents. If you have people reading skills, they do come in handy.&#10;&#10;The game features racers (pawns) that stand over 2&quot; tall. The racers are adorned with helmets and body armor when a player lands on a &quot;Armor Up&quot; space. Armor serves as insurance for losing a battle and keeps that racer from taking hit points in exchange for a piece of armor.&#10;&#10;Though linear like a race course, you have decisions to make on your turn. Who will you battle? When is the best time to play your Twist Cards? Nobody coasts to an easy victory here. Only the scrappiest competitors will earn a place on the winners podium which only has limited space reserved for the top three racers.&#10;&#10;"
