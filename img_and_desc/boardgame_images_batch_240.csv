Players roll a dice to move around the board. Upon landing on an interest badge space, they must choose one of the tiles from a face down selection. Most of the tiles represent Brownie badges in several categories, a few are hazardous events, and one shows the trefoil, crucial to winning the game. To collect a badge of the revealed category, the player must answer a trivia question relating to the category. Badges are available in the following categories:&#10;&#10;Animal Lover; Artist; Book Lover; Brownie Friendship; Cook; Collector; Conservation; Craft; Discoverer; First Aid; House Orderly; Music Lover; Pony Rider; Rambler; Safety in the Home.&#10;&#10;If the question is answered correctly, the badge tile is placed on the player's arm card (representing the badge being sewn onto the player's shirt sleeve). If it is answered incorrectly, the tile is turned face down again. When a player has collected five badges on her arm card, she must try to find the Trefoil badge from the face down selection in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Players can steal badges from Brownies who trespass on another player's campsite. Bonus badges can be won by landing on toadstool spaces and answering a general knowledge question. The game can end prematurely if too many Brown Owl spaces are landed on.&#10;&#10;"

During the course of play a player may buy and use service stations and garages, purchase insurance, get involved in accidents, collect income and get stars, which represent safe driving awards.

A player who buys a third car may take three consecutive turns.&#10;&#10;The path the players travel on the gameboard crosses itself twice. There is a traffic light at one intersection that regulates movement as players approach it. The traffic light changes when a player lands on one of four &ldquo;red dot&rdquo; spaces.

Each player starts with 4 egg-cups, in one of two colors, on the base row of the grid, with a ball on the two corner ones. The aim is to be the first player to move these cups to the baseline of the opponent and get the 2 balls again onto the 2 egg-cups on the edges. If the starting player does this first, then the opponent has the chance to get a draw if they manage to do the same thing in the turn immediately afterwards.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player picks one of two moves. A player can either move one cup with a ball to a free space that touches it, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Or a player can move the ball from one of their pieces to another one of their pieces that touches it in those same directions. When a blockade occurs, by 2 rows that block each other on the center rows, the active player may jump with a piece that contains a ball over an opponent's piece. When one player still has a piece on the start line, and the opponent has filled all other end-spaces, that piece needs to vacate its space right away. If this is impossible (when it doesn't contain a ball), then that player loses immediately.&#10;&#10;This appears to be Dieter Hartmann's only published game.&#10;&#10;PUBLICATION HISTORY:&#10;&#10;     1978 Transfer Edition Perlhuhn (G&#195;&#182;ttinger Spiele) - out of print&#10;&#10;&#10;Like all typical Edition Perlhuhn releases, this game comes in a tube, with chunky wooden pieces (black and red) and a board that is printed on a fake leather vinyl.&#10;&#10;ADDITIONAL INFO:&#10;&#10;     language skill needed: language neutral.&#10;     English translation: none.

The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.&#10;&#10;&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

This time, there is no board on which to place little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper &amp; Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and roads on your score card.&#10;&#10;To build you still require resources. These are collected by a Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts fifteen turns or about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Note that the game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as well.&#10;&#10;Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Catan Dice Game Plus.&#10;&#10;"
