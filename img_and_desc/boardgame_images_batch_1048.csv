Each line must connect at least 3 dots, all adjacent. From the second move, each line that is drawn must contain exactly one dot from the previous line. Lines may not be partially or totally overlapping. On each turn, and after having drawn a line, the player has the option of removing a free dot from the grid&mdash;that is, a dot that is not part of any line. &#10;The player who makes the last move wins.&#10;&#10;Published in Decemeber 2021 issue of Games World of Puzzles Magazine&#10;&#10;"

However, the outcome of his actions will be largely determined by the prayers of the tribe&rsquo;s shaman.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 12 rounds. Players have their own terrain boards where they advance their hunter and move their camp (a yurt) towards the desired location in the farthest corner of the board.  At the beginning of each round, the shamans offer sacrifices to the Goddess of Nature on the shaman hill. This will determine the order of players, and therefore the outcome of the next, preparation phase. Finally, players execute their actions: exploration by placing terrain tiles on the board, hunting, or moving their camp further.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players add up their scores received for the areas explored, the animals hunted and the distance they have reached with the camp. In addition, they can earn various bonuses for terrain tiles positioned in a smart way.
