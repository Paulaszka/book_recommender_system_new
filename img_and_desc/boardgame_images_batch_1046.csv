About half the cards cover history, including Leif Ericsson, Columbus, the Mayflower, Declaration of Independence, first railroads, etc.  The rest of the cards cover the geographic range of America: the cities Washington D.

At that point, everyone scores a word from their hand with bonus points for longer words, and for names of American cities or states. The largest point total is awarded if the 7-letter word is &quot;America&quot;. &quot;Alphabet Rhummy&quot; plays like normal rummy, letting you play words to the table once you have them, as well as add letters to existing words to make new words.

Attract the  birds with food so that they don&rsquo;t have to go hungry. The 25 bird cards are shuffled and then spread out on  the table face down. Three arbitrary cards are left face up so they are visible to all players, and the dice are &#10;placed nearby.&#10; The first player to roll a birdhouse starts.

The player has a total of 3 attempts, and can set aside any matching dice with each attempt &ndash; and continue to roll the dice/die the remaining times. The picture of a birdhouse functions as a joker and can stand for any colour. The X on the die is a &bdquo;Lame Duck&ldquo;, and can&rsquo;t be placed anywhere.
