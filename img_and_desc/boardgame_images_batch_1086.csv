The first date marks the German entry into the Crimea via the Perekop Isthmus, while the second marks the end of organized Soviet resistance across the whole peninsula. Those nine calendar months are divided into chronologically varied and unequal numbers of turns. That approach allows for the convenient simulation of the ebbs and flows in the action that took place due to bad weather and logistical and command-control constraints.&#10;&#10;The Perekop Isthmus fight, which took place from 24 September through 27 October, just off-map to the north, is not included in the game because it took place across terrain too restrictive to allow for maneuver by either side. At this scale it would have come down to how lucky the German player got in rolling his inescapably low-range and mid-range initial frontal attacks. So that episode is considered to have taken place as the last act of the Dniepr River campaign rather than the first act in the Crimean campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

I conversed with the thousand poets long dead, they who trod the roads weaving toward eternity and never returned. In the morning&rsquo;s warm embrace, my limbs felt their old vigor and the undeniable desire to travel. To seize the horizon. To behold hidden wonders. To exhume the words that will give life to my LAST HAIKU.&#10;&#10;Last Haiku is a one-player adventure card game with a dose of creative writing. You are the latest in a long line of poets feeling your age, and you know you are not long for this world. Yet you also feel the call of distant, uncanny, and wondrous places where you might seek the inspiration to write one last haiku to leave to the ages to inspire future generations of poets, who may themselves discover stranger, more distant places to spark the words of their own haiku.&#10;&#10;This is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with a few index cards and a pen. Each game will add new cards, either maps of locations or haiku your poet composed. The rules provide all the guidance you need for creating new cards and selecting the game&rsquo;s thematic elements, which makes every copy of Last Haiku an evolving, unique world. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. There is no limit to the places you can visit and the poetry you can compose.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game involves playing cards of the appropriate distance. If the card was created in a previous game, your poet travels deeper into the frontier. If you cannot play an existing card, you create a new site on a card and your poet is inspired to write a line of haiku, these lines recorded on a separate card. The game ends when you have written each of three lines forming your poet&rsquo;s last haiku, and your score equals the total of the distances of the new sites visited. Each new site and your haiku then enter the deck permanently.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

We must restore its glory! With the favor of the gods, we shall lead our people to become the chosen tribe that will bring unity and strength to the empire once again.&#10;&#10;Gods of Rome is a competitive area-control game that uses worker placement and card activation and lasts around 60 minutes. Players each choose a tribe at the start of the game and must lead that tribe to gain the gods' favor. On your turn, choose one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Visit a God: Gain a god's blessing token, which allows you to take an enhanced action later in the game, and place one meeple in that god's color &mdash; which might also be a player's color &mdash; on the game board in a matching-colored location.&#10;     Activate a card: Place a token on an action space on your player board to add more figures to the board, move figures, and attack opponents. If you have a blessing token of the same color as the location where the action takes place, you can take an enhanced action.&#10;     Score: Advance on the victory track depending on which territories you control in regions that match the gods you have visited, then clear all action spaces and remove your tokens from the god spaces. Special objectives change the scoring of territories from game to game.&#10;&#10;&#10;The favor track features three checkpoints, and as players gain favor, they advance on this track; if a player hits a checkpoint, all players score points based on their relative position on the favor track, then they advance to the checkpoint. After a player reaches the third checkpoint, players again score points, then whoever has the highest overall score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
