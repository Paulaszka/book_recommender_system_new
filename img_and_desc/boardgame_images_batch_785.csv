Twelve wooden pins numbered 1-12 are placed in a cluster in the starting area. On a turn, a player shoots a wooden disc from the slingshot-style launcher on the open end of the board to attempt to knock down one or more pins. If a player knocks over only a single pin, the player scores points equal to the number on the pin; if the player knocks down two or more pins, the player scores points equal to the number of pins knocked down. After scoring, the player stands the pins up where they fell. Alternatively, if the player knocked over a single pin, instead of scoring points they can place this pin in one of the two defense zones near the back of the playing area.&#10;&#10;If a player's score equals exactly 70 points, they win. If a player would score points and go over 70, then they instead lose points equal to the sum of the numbers on the pins, regardless of how many pins they dropped.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player reaches exactly 70 points and wins.&#10;&#10;"

There are a total of 16 numbered cards and while Card #1 and Card #16 are clearly defined as Rock and Paper respectively, it&rsquo;s impossible to say what range is defined as Scissors until the end

Set in the form of Smart Cities and defended by machines, the new world order is forced to find a solution to uncover illegal immigrants who manage to cross its borders and disguise among its citizens. Andrana Project, a Nano chip implanted in the nape of its inhabitants is the new identity document. From this moment on, everything involving a person is linked to their nanochip: their identity, bank and medical details, properties, titles... everything.&#10;&#10;Project Andrana is well received by the majority of the population, although many are opposed to its potential risks. In this context, an old ideological movement begins to acquire strength and prominence: The Neoluddites.&#10;&#10;Convinced that technology has a negative impact on people, their communities and the environment, Neoluddites believe that social and ecological collapse condemns most of the world's population to live in misery. Although this ideology has been alive for years, its followers had just passively abandoned technology until the arrival of Project Andrana, after which they started to get organized to act as a group. Neoluddites are dispersed all over the world and they know no frontiers. There are different factions, some more pacifist, and other more radical ones, determined to end the hegemony of the World Federation, which has taken technological evolution to the extreme. In time, some citizens of the World Federation will join this movement, tearing their nanochip off, becoming exiles and preparing to fight the system.&#10; Constant confrontations between the World Federation and the Neoluddites will shape the fate of humanity.&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This is the plot of Andrana Project, an independent game that will be able to test your strategic ability, emotional intelligence, teamwork capacity and leadership skills.&#10;&#10;Andrana Project is a phygital social game, this means that it is a group game, played face to face, supported on your smart phone or tablet.&#10;&#10;To play Andrana Project you need a minimum of 4 players with smartphone/tablet and Internet connection. Every player needs to download the game, one of them will start the game and each of them will be assigned a team and a character.&#10;&#10;In Andrana Project there are two opposing teams: the Neoluddites and the World Federation. Players from both teams have to discover their opponents to shut them down. The game has different missions that will get upgraded depending on how much it&rsquo;s played.&#10;&#10;Each player will be assigned a different character from each team, which means also different abilities and power inside the game.&#10;&#10;These are the main powers of each of them (among many others):&#10;&#10;The Neoluddites leader: As the Leader, he can recruit citizens. If he recruits a citizen he/she will become a Neoluddite and will fight for his team.&#10;&#10;Neoluddites Doctor: As a Doctor, she can heal herself or any player she wants, so she can prevent that person of dying.&#10;&#10;Neoluddites Citizen: As a citizen, they can save someone&rsquo; life, giving theirs instead. If they save someone from their team will result in a lot of points.&#10;&#10;All Neoluddites have to be careful when stealing the access. If they steal the wrong person their identity will be revealed to that player.&#10;&#10;Cybersecurity: As Cybersecurity, they can spy on one player to know his/her identity. They have the module, the Andrana server&rsquo;s access. The Neoluddites want to steal them. The Agent knows who this person is and he will try to protect him.&#10;&#10;DCS Agent: A DCS Agent can arrest other players to disable them in the next round. They are the only one who can recharge their weapon and attack more than once.&#10;They must protect Cybersecurity, being aware of shooting him, if they kill him their team loses the game.&#10;&#10;CITIZEN: As a citizen, they can save someone&rsquo;s life, giving theirs instead. If they save someone from their team will result in a lot of points.&#10;&#10;Each player needs to hide its identity from the rest, and at the same time observe their opponents to uncover theirs.&#10;&#10;"

The cat game piece has stopped on this field, so the move is to be made to the player who is next in turn. &bull; If the player&rsquo;s game piece gets onto the field with the cat&rsquo;s symbol, the player will throw the dice and move the cat&rsquo;s game piece by the number of points shown on the dice.  See special cases that may occur during the cat&rsquo;s movement  in VI and VII. &#10;3. If the game piece gets into this field, the marble will fall into the hole and roll down to the other tier (level).  The player will move the mouse game piece to a new field, cover the marble with it again, and take two tokens from the bank and cover the &ldquo;holes&rdquo; on the cheese piece with them.  See special cases in IV and V. NOTE. The trap field will be inactive if all five holes on the cheese piece are closed with tokens. In this case the player will put the mouse game piece near the hole, so as prevent the marble from falling. &#10;4. On the upper tier the Players&rsquo; game pieces will be moving in a circle until one of them (or the cat game piece) stands precisely on the field with a red flag &mdash; the finish field. NOTE. For the smallest kids the game may be finished when the first player reaches or crosses the field with the flag. &bull; Then the players turn their cheese pieces upside down and count the points on the tokens. The one who gains most points will be the winner.  &bull; In the event of two players with equal number of points the one who has reached the finish or is closer to the same will win.&#10;&#10;Developing game &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; in the form of a dimensional pyramid develops fine motor skills, memory and attention.
