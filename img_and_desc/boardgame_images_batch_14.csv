1641,,"Bounty is a game for 2 - 8 players from 6 years of age and older. The goal is to make as much money - 'Dubloons' - as quickly as possible! Players start from Home Port as merchants and set out on a trading voyage. By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!&#10;&#10;Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).&#10;&#10;Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the &lsquo;Treasure Chest&rsquo; cards which players draw every time they roll a &lsquo;one&rsquo;. They then find out whether they have landed without any wind in the doldrums, - or been blown by a hurricane to a distant port, - or have found buried treasure - or other such twists of fortune!'&#10;&#10;"

Players each have 1 field player and 1 goalie, and use a 14-sided black and white &quot;ball&quot; that determines the possession.&#10;&#10;The colour on the top of the ball determines who is next to kick. The kicker puts the field player next to the ball and releases its leg to kick the ball. The other player should try to block the kick with his or her goal keeper. After the kick the possession is once more decided and the same procedure starts all over again.&#10;&#10;"

You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.&#10;&#10;Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.&#10;&#10;You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.&#10;&#10;Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.&#10;&#10;The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.&#10;&#10;To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.&#10;&#10;"

Players race their discs across nine parallel seesaws, attempting to tip five of them in their favor by manipulating the balance of weight on each arm.&#10;&#10;Each seesaw (or &quot;scale&quot;) consists of six positions&mdash;three on each player's side of the central pivot. A piece&rsquo;s influence is determined by its distance from the fulcrum: pieces farther from the center exert more force, while closer pieces provide subtle counterbalance. A single piece on the outermost position can outweigh two or more opponent pieces placed nearer the middle.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll a die and choose one of your nine discs to either enter the board or advance along the connected path of seesaws. Movement follows a looping circuit across all nine beams, and your piece must move exactly the number of spaces shown on the die. The placement and timing of each move is key, as tilting one seesaw may destabilize another.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved when you&rsquo;ve tilted five out of nine beams to your side.&#10;&#10;Despite its dice element, the game favors tactical foresight over luck.

Was it Tordek in the Dragon's Lair with the Flaming Battle Axe? Or Mialee in the Dungeon with the Staff of Power?&#10;&#10;In Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a group of heroic adventurers has been called to the Archmage's castle, but one of those heroes isn't who he appears to be; one of the heroes is a doppelganger, a monster that can look like anyone! In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.&#10;&#10;For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.&#10;&#10;One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).&#10;&#10;"

The players start with a fixed number of aircraft which they distribute among the routes on the board. They then take turns rolling dice and moving their counters around the board.&#10;&#10;When a player lands on certain squares, he is paid for all aircraft he has on a particular route. The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).&#10;&#10;The players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast. It can be seen as a foreshadowing of Avalon Hill's Air Baron.&#10;&#10;"

Among the many small actions that made up this battle none was more important than the fight for Little Round Top, a rocky forested hill on which rested the extreme left flank of the Union line. It was here that the outnumbered 20th Maine regiment held off repeated Confederate assaults, turning back the South's best chance to win this battle which they could not afford to lose.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top is Avalon Hill's new game for two players which re-creates this critical battle. During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges. Fire and melee combat are resolved by a die roll on the appropriate Combat Results Table. Regimental officers and their command abilities are crucial for keeping the attack moving forward or the defense intact.&#10;&#10;Little Round Top comes complete with a colorful map of the battlefield, 100 cardboard playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.&#10;&#10;Playing time: 2 1/2 hours&#10;&#10;Complexity rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest): 4&#10;&#10;"

For the next 100 odd days, he would once again terrorize Europe at the command of the feared imperial French legions. Surrounded on all sides by armies of the great European powers, Napoleon's plan was to march north to Brussels, separate the Prussian and Anglo-Allied armies from each other, and defeat each in detail. Destruction of the armies would probably mean peace for France and the saving of the Emperor's Crown. Failure was unthinkable.&#10;&#10;HUNDRED DAYS BATTLES is Avalon Hill's strategy game for two or three players which recreates the climax of the Hundred Days Campaign. The division sized units of both sides are represented on the map by leaders who command their corps and army formations.

To win, the French must exit units off the map towards Brussels, or destroy the Allied armies.

Both players have 16 tiles (which are divided into 8 squares in a 2x4 grid).  The squares show either red roofs or gray plazas.  One set, used by the 'roof' player, has roofs on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  The other set, used by the 'plaza' player, has plazas on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  Each player shuffles their stack of tiles and places them FACE UP before them.  (Thus you can see what your opponent's next tile will be.)  The tiles will be placed onto a 17x17 board.&#10;&#10;Players alternate placing tiles onto the board with a few placement restrictions:&#10;&#10;1) The first tile must cover the center square of the board.&#10;&#10;2) Later tiles must be placed so that at least one square of the player's color touches a square of the player's color on a previously placed tile.&#10;&#10;The object is to form as large area of connected roofs or plazas as possible by the end of the game.  Each tile you have in this connection scores one point.  There are little 'tiddly wink' markers to aid in this counting process.  Each player tallies the tiles in their largest connected group, and the player with the greatest total wins.  The rules call for two games, with players alternating sides in the two games.&#10;&#10;The only other feature of the game is the veto.  Each player has the opportunity to 'veto' an opponent's tile ONCE per game.  A chip is simply placed atop the tile atop your opponent's stack to indicate that you are 'vetoing' that tile. The tile is placed on the bottom of his stack and will likely never rise to the top during the game.&#10;&#10;The game is VERY easy to learn and plays quickly... 20 to 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;"

There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.&#10;&#10;The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.&#10;&#10;Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.&#10;&#10;Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  &quot;Well&quot;, you say, &quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?&quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.&#10;&#10;As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.&#10;&#10;"

The object is to create a continuous rope from one side of the playing board to the other, while trying to prevent your opponent from completing his own rope connecting the other two sides. The catch is, many of the ropes splice together, allowing both players to build onto the same rope-path!&#10;&#10;"

Now all the pictures are mixed up. It is your messy job to find out which pictures belong together and which do not. But of course, the entire family will have to agree, and that is the tricky part. Just try and find an agreement that even your brother will understand....&#10;&#10;Kiek is a game of intuition and categories suitable for a group of three to eight players. It can be played for ten minutes or two hours, whatever you prefer, but be warned: the game keeps evolving, and it gets harder and harder to score points.&#10;&#10;"

Everybody seems to know about that fight you had with your girlfriend - everybody but you. And did you realize your neighbour is the most popular guy in town? For now, at least. Because people are saying...&#10;&#10;Gossip! is a fast-paced card game about reputations. Players spread rumours, some bad, some good, in an attempt to be seen with the most popular people. Or, even better, to become popular themselves. Timing is all-important: that guy at the other side of the table might seem like a nerd now, but he might be Mr. Perfect in just two or three turns. Playing cards can kill your reputation!&#10;&#10;"

While the basic concept of both is the same, four heroes venture into a dungeon to fight monsters and gain treasure, but Advanced HeroQuest's rules are more detailed and complex.&#10;&#10;The major additions and changes include:&#10;&#10;    fully solo playability&#10;    more complex combat system (role to hit versus target's weapon skill, then roll to wound vs target's toughness), including ranged combat, critical hits and fumbles&#10;    two phases of game play: exploration, combat&#10;    random dungeon generation system&#10;    modular game board&#10;    multiple colleges of magic and spell books&#10;    henchmen (in base game, as opposed to being in an expansion)&#10;    fate points (the &quot;undo&quot; feature)&#10;&#10;&#10;Games Workshop set Advanced HeroQuest in the Warhammer universe, presumably to foster sales of their miniatures.  The campaign world is easy to ignore, however, should players rather keep things generic.  Advanced HeroQuest also includes rules for using the characters and monsters from HeroQuest, should players want to do so.&#10;&#10;The game is supplied with Skaven figures that make up the quest within the rulebook. The exact same Skaven, henchmen and hero miniatures were also included in Mighty Warriors, also by Games-Workshop.&#10;&#10;The following White Dwarf issues contain adventure scenarios, spell lists, or other information for Advanced Heroquest:&#10;&#10;Issue #121     The Quest for Sonneklinge (scenario and Jade spell list)&#10;Issue #122     The Priests of Pleasure&#10;Issue #125     The Dark Beneath the World (scenario and Amethyst spell list)&#10;Issue #134     The Trollslayer's Oath&#10;Issue #138     Henchmen (new followers for AHQ: the Dwarf Trollslayer, the Elf Wardancer, the Human Captain, and the Wizard's Apprentice -- this material is duplicated in Terror in the Dark)&#10;Issue #139     Treasure (This material is also duplicated in Terror in the Dark)&#10;Issue #145     The Eyes of Chaos (has rules for both AHQ and HQ)&#10;Issue #150     The Changing Faces of Tzeench&#10;Issue #159     Rivers of Blood&#10;&#10;Advanced HeroQuest: Paint Set has replacement heroes and additional minis.&#10;&#10;"
