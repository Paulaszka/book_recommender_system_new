All of the above matters! After deep consideration, leave the rest to your luck! If you succeed, you can bring back valuable spirits for sure&hellip;&hellip; but if you fail, all of your efforts would be useless, and all the spirits in your tunnel will fall into the endless darkness.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players score by the combination of spirits they have, and the one with the highest score becomes the best librarian of the Dream&rsquo;s Library!&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#229;&#164;&#162;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#231;&#172;&#172;&#229;&#141;&#129;&#228;&#184;&#137;&#231;&#171;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#233;&#162;&#168;&#233;&#154;&#170;&#231;&#174;&#161;&#230;&#142;&#167;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#176;&#143;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#230;&#137;&#174;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#229;&#164;&#162;&#229;&#162;&#131;&#229;&#156;&#150;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#233;&#160;&#136;&#229;&#150;&#132;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#233;&#153;&#144;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#145;&#176;&#229;&#140;&#153;&#232;&#136;&#135;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#158;&#228;&#187;&#153;&#229;&#162;&#131;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#189;&#134;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#233;&#156;&#128;&#232;&#172;&#185;&#230;&#133;&#142;&#232;&#169;&#149;&#228;&#188;&#176;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#228;&#187;&#153;&#229;&#162;&#131;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#229;&#188;&#143;&#239;&#188;&#154;&#230;&#137;&#147;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#229;&#147;&#170;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#181;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#137;&#141;&#229;&#190;&#128;&#229;&#147;&#170;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#150;&#138;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#229;&#186;&#171;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#229;&#147;&#170;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#181;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#230;&#138;&#128;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#153;&#228;&#186;&#155;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#190;&#136;&#233;&#135;&#141;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#230;&#133;&#174;&#230;&#184;&#133;&#230;&#165;&#154;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#228;&#189;&#160;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#230;&#176;&#163;&#229;&#144;&#167;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#229;&#166;&#130;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#229;&#138;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#162;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#184;&#182;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#233;&#157;&#158;&#229;&#184;&#184;&#229;&#133;&#183;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#229;&#131;&#185;&#229;&#128;&#188;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#233;&#171;&#148;&hellip;&hellip;&#228;&#189;&#134;&#229;&#166;&#130;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#229;&#164;&#177;&#230;&#149;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#160;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#233;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#176;&#135;&#231;&#153;&#189;&#232;&#178;&#187;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#229;&#136;&#187;&#230;&#149;&#163;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#229;&#158;&#160;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#187;&#145;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#230;&#157;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#131;&#230;&#160;&#185;&#230;&#147;&#154;&#230;&#175;&#143;&#228;&#189;&#141;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#230;&#147;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#128;&#157;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#233;&#171;&#148;&#231;&#181;&#132;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#230;&#136;&#144;&#231;&#130;&#186;&#229;&#164;&#162;&#229;&#162;&#131;&#229;&#156;&#150;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#229;&#131;&#185;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#233;&#164;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;"

Fluff features palm-fitted rolling cups for poker-style peeking, and critter-adorned dice for &quot;wild-style&quot; play to inspire bolder bidding. Fluff up the bids, or challenge the calls. Be the best fluffer to outlast the other cast of characters.&#10;&#10;Each player places dice in their cup and gives them a good shake. Take a peek at the dice. Your goal is to &quot;call&quot; the total number of a particular dice across all the hands at the table. So the first player places a bid, such as &quot;I think there are 4 threes across all hands.&quot; Player to the left increases the bid or calls. You can only raise the value of the last bid by either increasing the value or quantity. So if I'm the next player, I can say 5 THREES, or keep the quantity the same and raise the value to 4 FOURS.&#10;&#10;Your other option is to call &quot;Fluff!&quot; on the existing bid. Say I bid &quot;9 FIVES&quot; and you have no fives. You might think I'm bananas, so you call &quot;Fluff!&quot; All players reveal their dice. If there are 9 FIVES or more, you would lose a die. If there are fewer than 9 FIVES, I lose a die, and I'm sad. You may also call &quot;Fluff!&quot; when it's not your turn, but you will lose two dice if you're wrong and the bidder still loses only 1 if you're right. It's risky and frisky!&#10;&#10;When you lose a die, set it aside for all to see, and start fresh with a new roll. The person who lost the die starts the next round with the opening bid.&#10;&#10;When you lose your last die, you're out. Now you're sad, too. Play continues until only one player has dice left. That player wins and may celebrate in any way they choose.&#10;&#10;So be the best fluffer to outlast the other cast of characters.&#10;&#10;"

Each Wet Season turn, they simultaneously select 2 cards from their hand: 1 to immediately place into their personal landscape and 1 to place into a communal row of cards called the Dry Season row. Players then exchange their hands and repeat until all cards have been placed.&#10;&#10;In the Dry Season, players take turns selecting 1 card from the Dry Season row and immediately placing it into their landscape. When the Dry Season row is empty, the game is over.&#10;&#10;Players have an opportunity to score points during both seasons by fully enclosing their paddies with paths. They will score for the size of a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; paddy, which can be increased by adding houses, as well as for farmers (a player&rsquo;s family members) and buffaloes contained within the paddy. A player-specific &ldquo;ancestor,&rdquo; representing the guiding spirit of a revered forebear, will also award that player additional points for achieving certain conditions.&#10;&#10;Strategically, opportunities abound in the card-rich Wet Season, when all share in a plenitude of resources and hands overflow with possibilities. Players must still think ahead to the Dry Season, though, when options will rapidly dwindle as the Dry Season row runs out of cards. The deck is micro and rounds are quick, but a sustainable plan for organically generating points is a must across the seasons.&#10;&#10;In the end, the player with the most points wins and may proudly boast of having the most fertile rice paddies in the region!&#10;&#10;"

Where conflict erupts is determined by which Theatres a player puts into play during their turn, from Washington to Beijing and everything in between.&#10;&#10;Players initially construct their deck.  Paying attention to how many Theatre cards they include, tempering this against the number units and force multipliers they need in order to get the job done.

Running out of Command tokens can see your grand strategy grind to a halt or your ability to counter your opponents actions (like being able to intercept that ICBM!).&#10;&#10;Control tokens are your life blood, the ability to gain Control tokens at the expense of your opponent is crucial to winning Code Red!

Pay attention when assigning forces to Theatres you wish to defend as well as those you wish to attack.&#10;&#10;Operations - The business end of the turn, players activate units and force multipliers in a Theatre by declaring a Code Alert for each Theatre they contest.&#10;&#10;Code Blue - do nothing&#10;  Code Green - Use your units to detect the enemies hidden forces&#10;  Code Yellow - Through a show of military power, force the enemy to withdraw from a Theatre, ceding control to you.&#10;  Code Red - War becomes hot!

Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth.

Your mission is to destroy as much English war facilities as possible via bombing raids, or to conduct reconnaissance over the North Sea...and still survive and come home. Zeppelin Raider is based on the popular Hunters game system by Gregory M. Smith that delivers a tense and nail-biting narrative throughout the course of play.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to conduct numerous missions which include two main types: Bombing missions are required to bomb a specific geographic location in England (London, for example), whereas Scouting missions are required to scout a specific location in the North Sea. Players are not limited by the mission parameters for success; as you may choose to bomb or successfully scout somewhere else. The success of each mission can result in promotion and crew advancement. Just as in the real war, the game system involves a great deal of chance (as was the case historically), but ultimate success rests on the decisions, you make during your career.&#10;&#10;A strong historical narrative is presented without overly cumbersome or complex rules to memorize so the focus is always on game play and what critical decisions you will make during each mission. Rules cover mission selection, altitude adjustment and gas cell tracking, venting, emergency jettison, maximum altitude, dynamic lift, wind and weather effects, fuel management, bombing missions, aircraft and ship encounters, zeppelin damage, crew advancement, awards and promotion, reassignment to a newer ship, a special resupply mission to Africa, and much more!&#10;&#10;This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters or Raiders of the Deep. While Zeppelin Raiders is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player gaming sessions and organized tournament play.&#10;&#10;"
