You are repairing a piece of pottery, then playing the role of an art critic for your opponent. You can win by being a better artist, being a better critic, or both! In true minimalist tradition, the lowest score wins!&#10;&#10;On your turn, play a card depicting fragments of pottery onto the previously played card to connect fragments together. Try to make your color of pottery connect to make the fewest pieces. But be subtle about it; if your critic (the player to your right) can guess your color, they subtract your score from theirs at the end of the round. Play 1 round per player, adding up scores from each round, and the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

Each player is one of powerful mages of the Black Rose Order who aspires to become the new Supreme Magister in order to acquire the mighty power of the Black Rose Artifact and the Forgotten Magic. Mages must fight, fulfill Black Rose desires, and gain strength with their spells until their power reaches the containment threshold of the prison where they are exiled, finally freeing themselves. Each mage has at their disposal six schools of magic, each one with its own strategy to annihilate their opponents and increase their power.&#10;&#10;At the start of the battle, mages start with a grimoire of six cards; as mages study more spells during play, their grimoire will increase. Every spell in Black Rose Wars has two different effects, increasing a player's adaptability during a fight.&#10;&#10;Mages fight each other in a modular arena of hexagons called &quot;rooms&quot;. They summon powerful creatures, cast destructive spells, or devise dark deceptions with their enchantments. The game system is divided into different phases. Each turn, after choosing new spells from the six schools of magic, players plan their strategy in advance, placing cards face down. Later, they reveal the played cards to kill each other, solve missions, summon creatures, or destroy the prison rooms, one against each other and against the Black Rose (the playing system).  &#10;After being killed, mages are reborn immediately, allowing them to re-enter the fight without delay &mdash; although their death still fed energy to those mages who caused it.&#10;The mage with the most power at the end of the battle will be crowned Supreme Magister of the Order by the Black Rose itself.&#10;&#10;"

Alfred must have assumed that the West Saxons could once again to look forward to a prolonged period of peace. But within five months Guthrum had reinforced his army and on the twelfth night, while the Saxons celebrated there holy period, Guthrum and his Viking Allies launched a surprise attack at Alfred's Royal estate at Cippanhamm. Through good intelligence, good fortitude and/or plain good luck Alfred was able to escape and with a handful of followers made his way to the marshes of the Somerset Levels.&#10;It is here in the most inhospitable of conditions of sea-flooded swamp that Alfred, with a handful of followers, was to make a seemingly impregnable fortress at Althelney. It was from that King Alfred was to launch a guerilla campaign against his Viking tormentors. Within five months the King's forces defeated the Viking Army of Guthrum in a pitched battle at Ethandun.&#10;Though Alfred entered the marsh with a small number of loyal followers we also know that he was not completely without allies. Odda Ealdorman of Devonshire was protecting Athelney by controlling the River Perret from Cynuit Hillfort, and was to do battle there with the legendary Ubbe Lothbrok (son of Ragnar) Alfred also had the support of Ealdorman of Somerset, Aethelnoth, who had also been fighting the Vikings from the Somerset levels. Aethelnoth's support was in no doubt instrumental in helping Alfred regroup and plan his campaign to reclaim Wessex.&#10;Not all of Alfred's Earls were as loyal as Odda and Aethelnoth, and in this game the Saxons of Wiltshire are in a state of civil war with their warriors split between loyalty for their King and a Saxon controlled Wessex. It is there that the treacherous Ealdorman, Wulfhere, gained control and sided with the Viking invaders.&#10;The Viking strength was in their professional and aggressive soldiery skills. Their weaknesses were often in the re-supply of fighting men and the fact the West Saxons were fighting for their home.&#10;Kings are of great importance in this series of games. When they are leading the warriors in combat your moral and thereby fighting ability is increased, without them weakened. Of course the loss of a King in battle can also mean the loss of your cause. However, in this era risks must be taken to take and hold the crown.&#10;Sharpen your sword and pick up your shield for the call has gone out, 'the King is on the march'&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

At the end of the game, the one who makes the pattern of life and death the same as they wish, will eventually become the winner.&#10;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#239;&#188;&#141;&#10;&#10;&#231;&#182;&#173;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#231;&#169;&#134;&#230;&#150;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#130;&#163;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#152;&#159;&#231;&#150;&#171;&#232;&#130;&#134;&#232;&#153;&#144;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#143;&#170;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#147;&#173;&#230;&#179;&#163;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#181;&#149;&#230;&#156;&#155;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#229;&#190;&#133;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#226;&#148;&#128;&#226;&#148;&#128;&#231;&#155;&#180;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#231;&#152;&#159;&#231;&#150;&#171;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#231;&#143;&#190;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#136;&#180;&#232;&#145;&#151;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#229;&#152;&#180;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#229;&#133;&#183;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#231;&#178;&#190;&#230;&#185;&#155;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#229;&#143;&#136;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#179;&#168;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#184;&#177;&#231;&#132;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#162;&#171;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#229;&#165;&#189;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#229;&#133;&#182;&#229;&#175;&#166;&#229;&#143;&#170;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#229;&#176;&#145;&#230;&#149;&#184;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#180;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#168;&#186;&#230;&#178;&#187;&#228;&#185;&#139;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#228;&#190;&#157;&#231;&#132;&#182;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#229;&#164;&#169;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#228;&#189;&#134;&#229;&#176;&#141;&#231;&#182;&#173;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#231;&#169;&#134;&#230;&#150;&#175;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#232;&#170;&#170;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#233;&#128;&#153;&#229;&#183;&#178;&#231;&#182;&#147;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#183;&#154;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#138;&#231;&#182;&#173;&#229;&#161;&#148;&#231;&#169;&#134;&#230;&#150;&#175; VITA MORS&#227;&#128;&#139;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#231;&#181;&#144;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#231;&#135;&#159;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#230;&#169;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#232;&#136;&#135;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#137;&#140;&#231;&#174;&#161;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#161;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#156;&#168;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#137;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#230;&#137;&#174;&#230;&#188;&#148;&#232;&#145;&#151;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#143;&#161;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#231;&#161;&#172;&#229;&#185;&#163;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#188;&#132;&#231;&#152;&#159;&#231;&#150;&#171;&#233;&#134;&#171;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#230;&#142;&#140;&#230;&#142;&#167;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#156;&#139;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#230;&#176;&#145;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#142;&#169;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#233;&#128;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#142;&#230;&#138;&#149;&#231;&#165;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#153;&#188;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#230;&#172;&#138;&#228;&#190;&#134;&#230;&#129;&#169;&#229;&#135;&#134;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#230;&#180;&#187;&#232;&#145;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#143;&#136;&#230;&#136;&#150;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#232;&#179;&#156;&#228;&#186;&#136;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#229;&#128;&#145;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#228;&#186;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#178;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#228;&#184;&#187;&#229;&#176;&#142;&#231;&#148;&#159;&#230;&#173;&#187;&#233;&#129;&#139;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#232;&#166;&#143;&#229;&#190;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#140;&#229;&#176;&#177;&#230;&#152;&#175;&#232;&#180;&#143;&#229;&#174;&#182;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;"

Betrayal Legacy consists of a prologue and a thirteen-chapter story that takes place over decades. Players represent families, with specific members of a family participating in one story, then perhaps an older version of those characters (assuming they lived) or their descendants showing up in later stories.&#10;&#10;Why would people keep exploring a haunted mansion for decade after decade, especially when horrible things happen there? Curiosity, I suppose, or perhaps an ignorant boldness that comes from the belief that we know better than those who have come before. Look at all that we've learned, marvel at the tools we have at hand! Surely we'll all exit safely this time...&#10;&#10;As with other Betrayal titles, the game is narratively-driven, with elements that record the history of your specific games. The tools mentioned earlier, for example, become attached to specific families. This isn't just a bucket; it's my bucket, the one my grandpappy used to feed his family's pigs when he was a boy, and while you can certainly use that bucket, I know how to wield it best from the time he spent teaching me how to slop. Yes, it's an heirloom bucket, and when kept in the family, I get a bonus for using it.&#10;&#10;"

What makes it most unusual is that the rules are dated 11/44, which means it must have been one of the first French games published after the liberation.&#10;&#10;This is a more complex game than L'Attaque or its successor Stratego. Its name translates as &quot;The Lightning War&quot; (or Blitzkrieg), and this is reflected in the mix of pieces.&#10;&#10;Whereas L'Attaque and its successor Stratego simply used numerically ranked pieces, this game includes a host of WWII-era innovations as well, with pieces representing parachutists, bombers, anti-aircraft guns, delayed-action bombs, flying bombs and a tanker-truck that must survive to keep the bombers flying. Missing from the mix is any kind of armored unit, but there are &quot;magnetic fences&quot; that somehow disable the engines of aeroplanes.&#10;&#10;Movement and combat is much more flexible than in the basic L'Attaque. Pieces may move in any direction, including diagonally, and may attack any piece orthogonally adjacent. To win, players must capture both the opponent's flag and its &quot;secret plan&quot;.&#10;&#10;"

When a letter or number appears that is in one of the pairs, everyone has to either do the gesture or say the phrase or both (depending on the agreed difficulty level) on the matching card. The last player to do this has to take all the open cards. The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
