This often-neglected period includes such significant conflicts as the Crimean War, the Italian Risorgimento, the wars of Bismarck's Prussia against Denmark, Austro-Hungary and France and ends with the Russo-Turkish war. Tactically, it saw armies struggle to adapt Napoleonic doctrines to incorporate important technological advances such as breech-loading rifles, greatly improved artillery and the first machine guns.A brief analysis of the essential strategic and tactical military developments of the period sets the context for the elegantly simple rules which are easy to learn, quick to play and yet deliver realistic outcomes. A selection of generic scenarios, covering flank attacks, pitched battles and meeting engagements, is supported by army lists for twenty-eight different armies. There are also twelve [ten, in fact] historical scenarios, ranging from the Battle of the Alma in the Crimean War to Sedan in 1870, the decisive battle of the Franco- Prussian War, each with historical background, deployment map, orders of battle and any special rules for that engagement. Useful appendices include a guide to further reading, an overview and price guide to the many scales and ranges of figures available, and a selection of useful addresses for the gamer. This is the ideal book for those new to gaming this period and veterans alike.&quot;&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of generic scenarios:&#10;Pitched Battle, Meeting Engagement, Rearguard Action, Flank Attack and Mini-Game.&#10;And 10 (not 12 as the above shows) historical scenarios.&#10;16 pages of color photos.&#10;&#10;"

To win the game, players need to manage their cards to arrange aircraft takeoffs and landings on the two airport runways and collect stars as fast as possible.  The first player to obtain 10 stars or points WINS!&#10;&#10;Game Setup:&#10;-Each player takes two Aircraft of the same color.&#10;-Shuffle the Action Card deck and deal each player 5 cards.&#10;-The rest of the Action Cards are placed face-down in the section of the board marked &ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&rdquo;&#10;-Shuffle the Aircraft Cards with the Scenario Cards. Place the deck face-down in the section of the board marked &ldquo;Aircraft Card (Draw)&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;-The order of play is to be determined by the players.&#10;-At the start of each player&rsquo;s turn, the player should make sure that each of the three Aircraft Card spaces, both North and South, has an Aircraft Card as shown here. If any of these spaces are empty, the player should draw cards from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile to fill them. After the player finishes his turn, the next player should again replace the Aircraft Card spaces from the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile if necessary.&#10;-If a Scenario Card is turned up before the game starts, no action is needed, and the drawn Scenario Card should be inserted back at the bottom of the Aircraft Card (Draw) pile. In subsequent turns, the instruction on the Scenario Card must be executed prior to any other action by any player.&#10;--A player can take a maximum of three actions on each turn; in other words, he or she can play a maximum of three Action Cards. All played Action Cards are discarded at the area marked &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Action Descriptions:&#10;-Take off from the Runway, Play a &ldquo;Takeoff Permit&rdquo; Action Card, or &ldquo;Landing Permit&rdquo; Action Card.&#10;-Select a face-up Aircraft Card from the &ldquo;Aircraft Card space.&#10;-Place an Aircraft on the selected Aircraft Card and place the set at the first space of the Runway.&#10;-A player uses &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft on the runways by matching the number of stars on the Aircraft Card. For example:&#10;-1-Star Aircraft: Requires one &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Card to move the Aircraft one space forward.&#10;-2-Star Aircraft:Requires one &ldquo;2 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card OR two &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward &#10;-3-Star Aircraft: Requires one &ldquo;3 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card, OR one &ldquo;2 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card plus one &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Card, OR three &ldquo;1 Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards to move the Aircraft one space forward.&#10;-So, the higher the number of stars an Aircraft Card has, the more difficult it is to move because it requires more arrows on the Action Cards. Using more &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards than what is required is acceptable for moving the Aircraft, but the player will not receive the difference back. For example, a player can use a &ldquo;3 Arrows&rdquo; Action Card to move a 1-Star Aircraft one space. However, the other two arrows will be forfeited.&#10;&#10;-When a player has moved the Aircraft to the third space on the South Runway AND then uses one or more &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; Action Cards that allow the Aircraft to move one more space forward, the takeoff process is complete. The player may keep the Aircraft Card and get a score according to the number of stars shown on the card. The first player to obtain 10 stars wins.&#10;&#10;-An Aircraft that has not completed the takeoff process in one turn will remain in its final position on the runway until the player&rsquo;s next turn. Aircraft idling on the runways are subject to other player&rsquo;s actions, including &ldquo;Diversions&rdquo; and instructions shown on drawn Scenario Cards.&#10;&#10;Diversion:&#10;-When a player wants to take off, land or move an Aircraft on the runway but is obstructed by another player&rsquo;s Aircraft, he may use a &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo; Action Card to divert it.&#10;-When a player uses a &ldquo;Diversion&rdquo; Action Card to remove another player&rsquo;s Aircraft, the player being diverted can use an &ldquo;Emergency Takeoff / Landing&rdquo; Action Card to stop the diversion. Without the emergency card, the affected Aircraft Card will be removed tothe &ldquo;Diverted Flights&rdquo; area.&#10;-When 10 Aircraft Cards have been removed to &ldquo;Diverted Flights&rdquo;, the game ends in a draw.&#10;&#10;Other Important Points :&#10;-A player cannot keep more than 10 Action Cards at any time; otherwise, he or she needs to discard the extra cards in the &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo; area.&#10;-When no more Action Cards remain, shuffle the cards from the &ldquo;Action Card (Discard)&rdquo; area and place the shuffled deck face-down at the &ldquo;Action Card (Draw)&rdquo; area.&#10;&#10;"

Normally, each player &quot;invests&quot; two of these cards to begin the round, placing them face down in front of himself. Players use their own hidden information (the cards they've invested) and the other players' bids to make educated guesses about the true value of the market (i.e. the total quantities of each commodity present among all players' cards), while trying not to give too much away themselves.&#10;&#10;One player kicks off the bidding, making a prediction about the minimum number of a given commodity present among all player's cards, for instance &quot;Five Wheat.&quot; The next player must then either increase the bid, or &quot;sell,&quot; thereby challenging the previous player's bid. When increasing the bid, however, players can choose between increasing the quantity (e.g. &quot;Seven Wheat&quot;) or adding a commodity to make a combo bid (e.g. &quot;Five Wheat and Gold,&quot; meaning that there are at least five of each). A player who is stuck, neither wanting to increase the bid nor challenge, has a third option available: investing an additional card (up to a maximum of 4) in order to change the bid to a new commodity (or combo) entirely, for instance, changing from &quot;Five Wheat and Gold&quot; to &quot;Six Oil.&quot; The catch is that this additional card increases the player's potential losses should they be the eventual loser of the round.&#10;&#10;When a player sells, all cards are revealed, and the loser of the challenge loses all the cards he had invested: his initial two, plus any additional cards he invested in order to change the bid. A player without cards is eliminated, and the last player standing is the winner.&#10;&#10;Cash or Cash plays well in groups from two to eight (though with the usual caveats about player elimination when playing with a large group, i.e. make sure there's something to do for those out early), and features two additional game modes and an optional &quot;doubling&quot; rule to accommodate different groups' preferences.&#10;&#10;In Endurance mode, only one card is invested by each player to start, and the bids can only be raised in single steps, for a more tactical game. In Blitz mode, on the other hand, players may bid and challenge out of turn, and there is no cap on the number of cards a player can invest; challenging successfully out of turn allows players to recover a card lost in an earlier round.&#10;&#10;With the doubling rule, the bidder who is being challenged may &quot;double&quot; in response to the following player calling &quot;sell.&quot; The challenger must then either withdraw her challenge and bid as usual, or else persist in the challenge, with the stakes now doubled (i.e. the loser will have to discard additional cards from their hand equal to the number lost normally).&#10;&#10;"

Some piggies will allow both players to score or take some special action, while others might have bad effects. The Master can use piggy cards in front of himself to avoid harm or seek out the highest reward.&#10;&#10;"

Can you help him pick up these toys from the floor of his room and put them away?&#10;&#10;To set up Linus, der kleine Magier, you shuffle 18 magnetized toy tiles (three each of six different toys) with 12 non-magnetized toy tiles (two tiles of each type), then spread them out on the table. Shuffle the 18 search cards (showing three each of six different toys) as well, then give the youngest player the Linus wooden figure, which has a magnet on its underside.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the player looks at the top search card, then places Linus on one of the toy tiles that matches this image. Did you find an enchanted toy that sticks to Linus? Super! Keep the toy tile and the search card, then give Linus to the next player. If, however, you found a regular toy tile, leave it on the table in the same location, then give Linus to the next player, who must now search for the same item (but with the hope of finding an enchanted one this time).&#10;&#10;Once all the enchanted toys have been cleared from the table, whoever has found the most toys wins!&#10;&#10;"

If he is deemed to be correct, without pause or error, he gets to keep the card. But if he has made &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;a mistake or speaks too slowly, he has to pass the card to his left neighbour, who makes the same attempt.&#10;&#10;If none of the players could recite the phrase correctly, the card is placed under the deck.&#10;&#10;Winner is the player with the most cards after the deck has been exhausted.&#10;&#10;"
