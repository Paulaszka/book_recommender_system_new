One ran through Murmansk in the far north, kept ice-free by the Gulf Stream and built during the First World War for the express purpose of receiving military supplies from Britain and the United States. In June 1941, two German mountain divisions crossed the border from Finland, intent on capturing the port and sealing off this vital access. After fierce fighting along the Litsa River, the offensive finally failed in the face of fierce resistance by the Red Army and Navy and workers&rsquo; militia units.&#10;&#10;In 1944, the Red Army returned the favor, with a lightning offensive spearheaded by elite light infantry and aimed at capturing Finland&rsquo;s ice-free port of Petsamo and occupying northern Norway.

BlackSheep is perfect for two to four players ages eight and up. -From the FFG website.&#10;&#10;There's a lot of randomness here, but also room for elementary strategy.  Players make poker hands from two shared cards (figurines of ranked animals) and three of their own (these are actual cards).  There are three such hands playing simultaneously, with players adding one or two cards at a time to any hand on their turn.  When all players have played three cards onto a hand, a winner is chosen, based on the poker ranks.  The winner takes the two shared cards (animal figurines), and new shared cards are added.  At the end of the game, scores are calculated by summing numbers printed on the bottoms of the figurines they captured and some bonuses.  The black sheep figurines are worth negative points.&#10;&#10;"

(&quot;Simply Ingenious: Whoever Risks Too Much Loses!&quot;) is a tile game related to the Ingenious board game in that players are once again collecting as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also needing to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well.&#10;&#10;To start the game, mix all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) face down, then turn three face up and place them in a shared pool in the center of the table. On a turn, a player flips a tile face up. If the tile doesn't match one of those in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can either end his turn and collect the face-up tiles before him and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn.&#10;&#10;If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. (With four players, the goal is five tiles.) Any tiles of a color you collect over seven are shuffled back into the supply.&#10;&#10;If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool. If the pool ever has fewer than three face-up tiles, reveal tiles and add them to the pool until three tiles are available.&#10;&#10;Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert! was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.&#10;&#10;"
