Timing a swing of the pendulum, the other player attempts to knock the ball off the rail and into one of the scoring areas marked 100, 200, 500. If the player misses, the other player attempts to catch the pendulum and, if successful, can take a shot at scoring as well.&#10;&#10;Play continues until someone scores, in which case the scoring player sets the ball in action again, or until the ball stops rolling, in which case the original &ldquo;roller&rdquo; sets the ball on its path again.&#10;&#10;The game is over when either player has placed all 10 markers and the scores are tallied.&#10;&#10;Impact was released in 1971.
