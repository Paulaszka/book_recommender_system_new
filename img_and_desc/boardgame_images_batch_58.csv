(Ein solches Ding), players are challenged to name something&mdash;real, imaginary, or just barely plausible&mdash;that fits an ever-growing list of characteristics. Each card adds a new trait like &ldquo;can fly,&rdquo; &ldquo;made of metal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;has eyes,&rdquo; and players take turns layering on more requirements from their hands. Think you've got a match in mind? Great&mdash;keep the round going. But if you start to doubt, you can call out the famous phrase: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;When challenged, the previous player must name a thing that fits all the listed criteria. If their answer is deemed reasonable by the group, the challenger is penalized. But if their claim is too absurd (or they can&rsquo;t come up with anything), the penalty flips back on them. The game supports multiple modes: be the first to empty your hand of cards, or race to score points by identifying things that match three face-up traits.&#10;&#10;Silly, cerebral, and sneakily strategic, Such a Thing? is as much about creativity and persuasion as it is about logic. Perfect for groups who enjoy quick-thinking party games with just the right dose of debate.&#10;&#10;Similar in spirit to: Perpetual Notion, FitzIt, It Fits, and JaLink!&#10;&#10;"

Players &quot;cast&quot; by rolling their allotted five coin-like &quot;Casting Stones&quot; to generate Spells, Potions or Charms, depending on which way the stones land. The object is to beat your opponent's roll and end up putting a &quot;Gem&quot; on one of the game board &quot;Turrets.&quot; The first person to place four Gems on four consecutive Turrets wins. The game can become interesting when certain casting situations allow one player to knock another's Gems off the Turrets, thereby setting the opponent back a step. Players can up the level of gaming complexity in the &quot;Intermediate Game&quot; by adding the two &quot;Casting Cards&quot; into game play. These are included with the Starter Set and enhance the effect of Spells, Potions and Charms. The &quot;Advanced Game&quot; adds more options and strategies to game play, yet requires separate purchases of additional Casting Stones and Casting Cards sold in &quot;Refill Sets.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Differences from standard Crazy Eights are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     If you only have one card left, you have to say 'Bartok'. If you don't, you get your hand made back up to maximum.&#10;     Most other rules violations require you to take one or more cards.&#10;     Players aren't allowed to ask questions during a game. Ask a question, take a card. This is most entertaining when someone comes along and asks 'What are you playing?'. They'll usually get a card, and then several more when they don't say Bartok.&#10;     This is the doozy: A player that successfully gets rid of his last card is deemed the winner for that round, and gets to make a new rule, which overrides any later rules. These can be as simple or as brain-hurty as you like. Usually the game gets harder as it progresses, as rules feed off each other and make lethal feedback loops.&#10;&#10;&#10;Some example rules, to give you an idea of the flavor of the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    When a change of suit changes color, play direction reverses. (easy)&#10;    When a two is played, play skips a player. (easy)&#10;    Threes don't exist. (somewhat metaphysical)&#10;    When a black ace is played, each player must slap a card face down in the middle of the table. The last player to do so takes all of the other cards. (moderate, more of a wakey wakey rule)&#10;    When a black queen is played, all of the cards increment their values by one, with kings wrapping to become aces. Red queens decrement the values by one. (somewhat mind numbing)&#10;    Prime numbered cards swap to become the suit of the same colour - ie. clubs &lt;-&gt; spades, diamonds &lt;-&gt; hearts. (brain hurty, especially when combined with the rule above)&#10;&#10;&#10;Any rule disputes are usually settled by voting. You play until you're bored, or until someone creates a rule that would explicitly end the entire game (with or without ultimate winners), and the rule is triggered. The game can also end if further play becomes impossible, as a result of how the created rules combine.&#10;&#10;SURGEON-GENERAL'S WARNING: Do not play this game with mathematicians :)&#10;&#10;"

After the non-aces have completed their entire movement plot then the ace's can plot out the rest of their move and therefore react to the less-skilled pilots actions. The number of points the ace can withhold is based on the 'grade' of the pilot with a 'grade 5' pilot unable to withhold any points to a 'grade 1' pilot being able to withhold 3.&#10;&#10;Game related to Aces High: The American Aces&#10;&#10;"

It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).&#10;&#10;There are three major sub-games in Attack!:&#10;1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire &quot;set&quot; (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of &quot;1&quot; that represents a region without any special economic value (just &quot;population&quot;).&#10;&#10;The units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.&#10;The map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa).

The 2 maps use hexagons to regulate placement and movement of units, and have overlays for the hills creating a 3D effect. The smaller map represents the area around the Golan Heights: the frontier region between Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The Jordan River crosses the map from north to south, with the Galilean Sea in the middle. The big map represents the Sinai, focused on the area around the Suez Canal.&#10;&#10;The basic game is only played on the Sinai map. Each turn corresponds to 2 days and is subdivided into 10 phases. The Egyptian player goes first, taking 4 phases. Then the Israeli player takes 6 phases. During each phase players can move their units. Combat takes place, using a calculation based on the number of units a player has.&#10;&#10;The advanced game is played on both maps by 2, 3, or 4 players. The aircraft combat rules are introduced. The aircraft are divided into 3 categories: bombers, interceptors, and fighter-bombers. Each turn is divided into 9 phases. Arabian player turn has 4 phases and the Israeli 5.&#10;&#10;Victory is calculated by comparing victory points:&#10;- for Israel, 20 points if Damascus is occupied, 5 points for any other Syrian city occupied, 2 points for each intact bunker, 1 point for each reduced bunker, 5 points for each unit standing west of the Canal, 2 points for each Egyptian bridge destroyed.&#10;- for the Arabs, 10 points for each Israeli city occupied, 2 points if the Syrian bunker remains intact, 10 points for each controlled pass, 1 point for each unit exiting along the coast road to Israel, 1 point for each Israeli unit eliminated. If less than 16 units are standing east of the Canal, the player has to remove (16 - number of unit) to the score.&#10;&#10;"
