Bring them what they need in a timely manner and you'll be rewarded with a full-time contract(handsome salaries and benefits included).&#10;&#10;Build a crew, mod your ship, and race against the other competing crews, to mine resources and battle your way to victory! This is an uncharted galaxy, so anything goes.&#10;&#10;The game board is customizable and modular, so gameplay is different every time you play. Before you start the game, players will take turns placing game pieces for the session. You can play however you'd like!&#10;&#10;A single mission card, showing which resources and how much of each are required, is drawn for the game session (all players will be racing to complete this). The first player to gather the requested resources and travels back to the space station wins the game. All players (given three random crew members) start at the space station at the beginning of the game, and roll dice to determine how far they can navigate that turn(crew skills can increase this roll).&#10;&#10;Once a player has reached a planet or asteroid(each have their own unique resources) they can mine. You can mine a planet once per turn, for a max of two turns. Mining does not end your turn however, so its best to start it by mining every time.&#10;&#10;You can also battle other players to steal their resources, eliminate crew members, or destroy any tech mods they may have. This requires you to be on the same spot as the opposing player however. Another way to use your turn is to spend any unneeded resources to upgrade your ship with tech mods or new crew members (max of 4).&#10;&#10;Once a player has acquired the necessary resources to complete the mission card, they must navigate back to where they started the game. Once they have arrived, they win the game. Watch out for other players trying to steal your loot though!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Not long ago they lived among us and they used their cunning magic to look like us humans.&#10;They lived with their cattle in the mountains. Their caves were beautiful and luxurious with a lot of silver, gold, gems, and a table full of delicious food. In Sweden, there is an expression for this &ldquo;Rich as a troll&rdquo;.&#10;Trolls were not evil if you didn&rsquo;t treat them badly, they could even be helpful to those who treated them well. But they often played tricks on humans. Their magic power (trollkraft) could distort the vision of humans so the troll looked like a human, an animal, a log, and a stone and even become invisible. But they also had some weaknesses. They couldn&rsquo;t stand the sounds of church bells or steel, not to mention the sight of sun.&#10;&#10;Trolls &amp; Princesses is a &ldquo;worker movement&rdquo; game. You play as one of four troll clans and to get the mountains king&rsquo;s favour, you try to impress him. The players get favour (in the form of victory points) when they do what trolls usually do: swap changelings, &ldquo;hire&rdquo; humans, tear down church bells, kidnap princesses, build their cave, and use troll magic. To succeed, the players must collect resources and move around their trolls to do different actions. The player with the most victory points at the end can crown himself the ultimate troll clan leader.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
