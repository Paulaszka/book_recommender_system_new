Property cards are printed with advertisements by local businesses and organizations.  The game features an equine theme -- all playing pieces are colored horses, and wooden &quot;stalls&quot; and &quot;stables&quot; take the place of houses and hotels.  The game also adds a trivia element -- the ARC and United Ways cards (which replace Chance and Community Chest) feature trivia questions in addition to the usual instructions.  Players may choose to ask these questions of their opponents -- if anyone answers correctly, they win $50 from the bank; otherwise, the player asking the question wins the money.  Apart from these and a few other minor differences, the game plays like its more famous inspiration.&#10;&#10;"

Pieces are set up on a board in a manner similar to Stratego, but rather than being linear (numerical values), the units have a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  i.e. the tank unit is superior to infantry and engineers but is inferior to aircraft, artillery, and mine units.&#10;&#10;For those who want to recreate the (army) game, the pieces are as follows:  Private, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant = 3 each.  Second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, 1, 2, 3, and 4 star generals = 1 each. Tanks=2, plane=1, Anti-aircraft/anti-tank=5. Mines=6, Engineers=6. A-Bomb=1.&#10;&#10;Infantry take each other according to rank; infantry also takes anti-aircraft/anti-tank and engineers.  Tanks and planes take infantry and engineers. Plane takes tank, anti-aircraft/anti-tank takes planes and tanks, engineers take mines without damage.  Mines are stationary pieces that explode and destroy anything that triggers it except an engineer. The A-Bomb is essentially a movable mine that destroys every piece in a surrounding square when it explodes.&#10;&#10;The pieces are like mah jongg tiles arranged so that the opponent cannot see what kind they are -- he just sees blank pieces advancing toward him. When a piece is attacked or attacks, it is turned over so that the face is visible.  It then becomes a known piece for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;We played the game in Hawaii in elementary school in the late 1950s.  There were two blank pieces included, presumably in case a piece got lost.  We sometimes used these to create two additional pieces, the brainwasher and the kamikaze.  The kamikaze was simply a flying bomb.  The brainwasher changed an opponent's piece into one of your own.  It was not possible to brainwash the A-Bomb.&#10;&#10;"

The game is driven by a deck of rather silly delivery cards. There is a deck of insurance policy cards (in the event of disasters). And a six-sided die.&#10;&#10;Players begin by selecting a spaceship dealer or dealers and rolling the six-sided die, then paying for their spaceship. They then build and pay for their home base (which doubles as a permanent transporter), selecting a star system from the map. Each star system has a cost to build, ranging from 10-50, which indicates the value and frequency of deliveries that can be made to that system.&#10;&#10;Play is relatively simple. On each turn, players draw one delivery card, which usually specifies a cargo and three destinations, varying in value. The cargo is automatically available at the system where the player's rocket pawn is located. The player may then deliver that cargo to the best possible destination (if any is possible). Deliveries may only be made to star systems connected by the players. Upon arrival at a system specified by their card, players are paid for the cargo.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on arrival at a system. However, to depart from a system a player must possess a matter transporter at that system, or pay another player to rent their transporter. If no transporter is present, the player must build one on a later turn in order to move.&#10;Random events are included in the delivery deck. Some of these can result in loss of spaceship or transporter, or devaluing of cargo. A player may buy an insurance policy, partially covering the cost of losing a ship or transporter.&#10;&#10;The delivery deck has a reshuffle card. Upon reshuffling, an end-of-game card is added to the delivery deck. The length of play can be altered by choosing where and when to shuffle these two cards into the deck. The player with the most money when the end-of-game card is revealed wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The complete box includes also a couple of spare cards, some measurement cards that can be used to measure the size of your ear, and a c-cassette containing sound effects from the cards.&#10;&#10;A single round of this game begins by dealing each player a certain amount of cards (10 - 16) depending on the number of players - more cards with less players. On each round every player has two goals: to get rid of all his/her cards, and to collect sets of 3+ colored cards with a same text.&#10;&#10;During each round The first player who manages to empty his/her hand wins the round but isn't necessarily the player who receives the most points. That's because the most points are awarded from the collected sets. The winner, however, receives bonus points according to the cards still left in the hands of other players and other players get a lot of penalty from those cards. There is also a 100 point bonus awarded for a player who wins the round with only a single set on the board.&#10;&#10;The game is played over multiple rounds which all are scored. The winner is the player who first reaches 500 points. Because the amount of points gained from a round can vary from -150 to +450 the games can last forever or only for less than an hour.&#10;&#10;The fun part of the game is that when a player plays a card he/she must say what's printed in the card, like: &quot;Splappa dap!&quot;, &quot;Arra Argh Yargh&quot;, or &quot;Fippaditty Fappaditty Fappa daMap!&quot; It comes naturally after a few games, believe me.&#10;&#10;"

The British Home Fleet relentlessly tracked the German warship, and she finally sank beneath a hail of gunfire.&#10;&#10;This Second World War at Sea game has one of the larger operational maps in the series; the North Atlantic is a big and empty place. There are two 34x22-inch maps, covering the area from north of Iceland south to the latitude of Spain. The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament.&#10;&#10;The game includes 24 pages of rules and 12 scenarios which feature not just the Bismarck chase, but also the North Atlantic raids made by the German warships Admiral Hipper, Admiral Scheer, Gneisenau and Scharnhorst.&#10;&#10;"

Towers are owned by the various guilds. These are the power plants (energy), factories (synthesis), and government facilities (control). Domes are smaller structures used to house the citizens.

Both towers and domes are color-coded to identify guild affiliation; red for energy, blue for synthesis, green for control, and black for builders.&#10;&#10;Each of the guilds wants its towers positioned close to the towers and domes of other guilds (their customers) and far away from its own other towers (to avoid competing with other towers of their own guild). Location, location, location! Some things never change, even in the distant future.&#10;&#10;The Builder's Guild is unique because there are no Builder's Guild towers, i.e., no black towers. Instead, the Builders are compensated for their efforts by being given the profits of some of the other guilds&rsquo; towers that the Builders choose as they construct the city.&#10;&#10;The players in this game are competing builders working to construct the city.
