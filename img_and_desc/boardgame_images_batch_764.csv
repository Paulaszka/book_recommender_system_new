Ireland would rise, he insisted, if France would only lend its support. That year, a force of 14,000 Frenchmen on 43 ships evaded the British fleet and sailed into Bantry Bay, Cork County, Ireland where rough weather forced them to abandon their operation and return to France.&#10;&#10;Two years and three audiences with Napoleon later, Tone tried again. Three waves of French landings were planned to coordinate with a general rising of the United Irishmen (Protestant and Catholic alike) all across the island. Unfortunately, word leaked and key leaders were arrested in Dublin, triggering an early rising, quickly and brutally put down by a combination of professional troops, recently raised fencibles, local militia and orange order yeomen. The rebellion staggered on through September but only in County Wexford and later in County Mayo with minimal French support, did the rebellion meet with any success.&#10;&#10;As for the French, the first wave of 1100 men under the able command of Jean Humbert, stormed ashore in County Mayo in August, 1798. A smaller force landed in Donegal in September under the command of Napper Tandy. Humbert enjoyed a few successes but soon surrendered to the overwhelming force Lord Cornwallis brought to bear. Soon after, Tandy abandoned the Emerald Isle when he realized he could no longer be of service to Humbert. A month later and further North off the coast of Donegal, a second wave of 3000 men under Jean Hardy and Wolfe Tone himself met with disaster.  Hardy&rsquo;s fleet ran afoul of the British fleet and Tone was captured. Imprisoned and condemned to hang, Tone committed suicide. The third and largest wave of French soldiers never sailed.&#10;&#10;Without determined French support the Irish rebellion of 1798 stood little chance of success. Historically it was a bloody great uncoordinated fiasco made worse by the early demise of Tone&rsquo;s benefactor, General Hoche to consumption. History might have been different if the stars had aligned, if those key Irish leaders had not been captured and their plans revealed, if the rebels had received a sizeable number of French and British arms, if Hoche had survived. If a second and even a third wave of French regulars had landed, and if those French regulars had landed while the rebellion was still vibrant, then &ndash; then, as WOLFE TONE&rsquo;S RISING reveals, England would have had a serious problem.&#10;&#10;WOLFE TONE&rsquo;S RISING puts the aforementioned what-ifs into play. A short game of seven turns pits English regulars and loyalist militia against the Irish rebels and their French allies. Here, the French play a shell game with the British attempting to land troops in Ireland not once but three times. Here, unknown morale plays a vital role to the outcome of every battle. Here, Local leaders are not cookie cut-outs but individuals who enjoy unique abilities in battle. And here, each battle is assisted by a battle board utilizing fresh mechanics that make each battle a mini-game unto itself.  A note on the leaders used: British and French leaders are key historical leaders, whereas Irish rebel leaders are largely representational.  Anonymous loyalist leaders represent a mixture of militia and yeomen. Loyalist hierarchy was either nonexistent or too confusing to identify specific names.&#10;&#10;"

Moreover &quot;Faction&quot; means that the product format is sold according to the different kingdoms or factions. New expansion sets come in new boxes containing FULL PLAYSET (not only 1-2 copies) of new cards for its corresponding faction or an alliance of 2 kingdoms. So, it's not necessary acquiring the full expansion if only an specific kingdom is wanted.&#10;&#10;If you like classic Card Games mechanics but want something really NEW, and a true new strategic component which will make you develop your strategies at a higher level, this is your game.&#10;&#10;Both players start with 20 life points, and our goal is reducing opponent's life to 0 or below. But to achieve that we need to cast our troops in our invocation line (first line)and cross with them all the battlefield, fighting enemy troops to reach their lines and &quot;hit&quot; them equal to our troops ATK value. As said, 20 points means victory. The fact troops need to move makes them have an unusual basic value: they have ATTACK/LIFE and SPEED (number of zones -cells- they can run in a turn).&#10;&#10;But troops, objects and the rest of cards aren't played for free. It's fundamental to produce mana and gold for that. With this purpose, we will build &quot;Place&quot; cards with a cost and production amount. So, each turn we will add mana and gold equal to 1 plus the production indicated by our place cards. A good curve in resources production means a good match development, and that will make us stronger.&#10;&#10;Important: place cards are separated from &quot;battle cards&quot; (the rest: troops, objects, spells...), for us to choose what we want to draw each turn.&#10;&#10;In a players' phase, they prepare all &quot;turned&quot; (exhausted) cards, add resources, build places, invoke troops or forge objects, then go to tactical phase, in which they can move troops one by one, cast spells, play hero skills, equip objects, fight against enemy troops or hit enemy player.&#10;&#10;Sudden spells can be also played in response to opponent's actions, in order to disable their strategy.&#10;&#10;A 1vs1 game which would charm any card+strategy game lover.&#10;&#10;We summarize it with a single sentence: &#10;END OF GAME.

For example, if the team's four words are &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;candy&quot;, &quot;tent&quot;, and &quot;son&quot;, then I might say &quot;Sam-striped-pink&quot; and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1.

There are bad doings, and a child or two frequently goes missing. This year, Miskatonic University students engaged in occult studies have been turning up dead. Arkham Police, in deference to your unusual expertise, have asked for your help to get to the root of the matter. Time is of the essence because after Walpurgis Night, the trail will grow cold and the culprits will retreat to the shadows until the next Witches' Sabbat, when the next cycle of deaths will begin.&#10;&#10;As private investigator Howard Lovecraft, you will investigate events based on the stories &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; (1933), &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Unnamable&quot; (1923).&#10;&#10;Arkham Noir is a solitaire card game inspired by the interconnected stories of H. P. Lovecraft and other authors, re-imagined as noir detective stories. Each case stands alone.&#10;&#10;Gameplay consists of adding cards to open cases, creating lines of investigation in an effort to solve them. The ultimate goal is to score five &quot;puzzle&quot; clue cards in order to piece together the big picture before running out of time or mental stability.

Una vez m&aacute;s, la polic&iacute;a de Arkham reclama tu inusual experiencia para llegar a la ra&iacute;z de los hechos. Debes actuar con rapidez antes de que las huellas del culto se desvanezcan y los culpables vuelvan a ocultarse entre las sombras, donde permanecer&aacute;n hasta el Sabbat de las brujas, cuando comenzar&aacute; un nuevo ciclo de muertes.&#10;&#10;Ponte en la piel del investigador privado Howard Lovecraft e indaga los sucesos basados en los relatos: &ldquo;Los sue&ntilde;os en la casa de la bruja&rdquo; (1933), &ldquo;El que acecha en el umbral&rdquo; (1933) y &ldquo;Lo innombrable&rdquo; (1923).&#10;&#10;Arkham Noir es un juego inspirado en la interconexi&oacute;n de relatos de H. P. Lovecraft y otros autores, reinventados como historias detectivescas de novela negra. Cada caso de la serie Arkham Noir es independiente y se juega en solitario. El juego consiste en ir a&ntilde;adiendo cartas de pista a las l&iacute;neas de investigaci&oacute;n de los diferentes casos abiertos con el prop&oacute;sito de resolverlos. El objetivo final es recabar 5 tipos de pista diferentes con el atributo Puzle, que al unirlas nos proporcionen la perspectiva general de los sucesos acontecidos, cuidando de que no se acabe el tiempo o perdamos la cordura.&#10;&#10;Cada volumen de la serie nos enfrentar&aacute; a un reto &uacute;nico, con grados de dificultad adaptables para cualquier tipo de jugador.&#10;&#10;"

As the summer of 1944 drew to a close and Combat Command A of the American 4th Armored Division passed through the French town of Arracourt the war seemed all but over. It seemed as if nothing could stop the Americans from forcing their way across the German border and reaching the Rhine River. The weather, however, was rapidly deteriorating and Allied air reconnaissance failed to detect a counteroffensive by the German 5th Panzer Army. The stage was set for the largest clash of armor on the western front until the Battle of the Bulge.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two quick-playing four turn scenarios depicting the German attempt to drive the Americans from the German border. The first scenario (September 19 - 22, 1944)  pits two inexperienced German panzer brigades against a confident and veteran Combat Command A. The German side has more armor, including the superior Panther tank, and the poor weather generally favors them, but the American side has more artillery as well as better tactics and leadership. The second scenario (September 25-28, 1944) pits the experienced German 11th Panzer Division against Combat Command A and the newly arrived Combat Command B, now hampered by restricted fuel supplies. In each scenario both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to simply attack, or spend valuable time attempting to maneuver in continually changing weather conditions before attacking.

Karn did not mention this in his report, so as not to expose the inhabitants to repressions due to the illegal involvement of prince Linnamen. &#10;During the game of &ldquo;Hattrick&rdquo;, the players become the characters of this story.
