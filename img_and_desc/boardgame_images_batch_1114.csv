They have been invited to see the hyper modern, fully automated Alcatraz Prison, before it is officially opened. As luck would have it, though, something goes wrong, and the characters become inmates of the penitentiary. Now they all want to flee the island.&#10;Each turn a player chooses a character to move on the island, trying to collect Escape Cards they could have use of when performing their Run. While moving they have to look out for Sentinel guards, and Drone attacks. Each rescued character gives the player a point, and the player with the highest score at the end wins.&#10;The game is semi-cooperative, and players can team up to raise their chances of successfully fleeing. While the game goes on, the Prison System is gradually waking up. At the point it is fully activated it becomes impossible to flee. The game ends when this happens, or when no living prisoner remains on the island.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
