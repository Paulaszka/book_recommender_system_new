5752,,"Black Sea * Black Death is a simulation-game for 2 to 4 players of the Soviet amphibious operations conducted in early February of 1943 as a part of Operation Gory/Morsky (Mountains/Sea).&#10;&#10;The objective of Operation Morsky was to surround and take the port city of Novorossisk, opening the way to a drive on Anapa which cut the main supply line keeping the German 17th Army alive in the Kuban-Taman area.&#10;&#10;The game covers a battle of 9 1/2 days on a scale of one half mile per hex (800 meters) and one turn per day. Fighting takes place on beaches, in mountains, in an industrial city and in the air overhead, with the units involved being mostly of battalion or company size (roughly 100 men per strength point), with naval units representing one ship or two boats, and air units each representing ten aircraft.&#10;&#10;There are some unusual concepts in the game system, as well as a considerable amount of detail.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day&#10;Hex: 880 yards / 804 meters&#10;Units: Company to Regiment&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;Two dual-side printed countersheets (1 combat, 1 markers - 600 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 40-page Black Sea - Black Death rules booklet&#10;Two Player Aid cards (in rules booklet)&#10;One 4-page Charts &amp; Tables booklet (in rule booklet)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 2-20 hours&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Moderate&#10;&#10;"

5755,,"Guadalcanal is a hex based simulation of the land battle of Guadalcanal from August, 7 1942 through January 29, 1943, with battalion-sized units and a map scale of approximately one mile per hex. The naval and aerial combat that surrounded Guadalcanal are assumed to have their historical results so only historical reinforcements are available.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Basic Game&quot; introduced the components: the map board, unit counters, victory conditions, movement, zones of control, and combat.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Tournament Game&quot; the effects of different terrain types, reduction of units due to combat rather than wholesale elimination, ranged artillery fire, and point-based victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Optional Rules&quot; introduced hidden movement, supply rules, different ranges for different artillery units based on their historical composition, withdrawing units from the island, and specialized capabilities for amphibious tractor and engineer units. Records for step reduction were kept on paper side records, rather than using reduced units (as in Anzio: The Struggle for Italy &#226;&#128;&#147; 1943-1945); records for hidden movement were also kept on paper, rather than using screens to hide each player's view of the opponent's forces as in Midway.&#10;&#10;The game victory conditions in the basic game were that the United States won if the Japanese were unable to hold Henderson Field for two consecutive turns between the September 25 and November 20 turns, inclusive, with the game ending on November 20 turn. The Tournament Game extended until the January 29, 1943 turn, with the point-based victory determined based on points awarded for eliminating enemy combat factors, occupying Henderson Field, or (for the Japanese) having Henderson Field in range of their artillery units.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill discontinued the game before assigning it a complexity rating; however, in the  Avalon Hill &#039;&#039;General&#039;&#039;, Volume 3, Number 6, Avalon Hill assigned to the game the following characteristics:&#10;&#10;     Playing Time: 2-4 hours&#10;     Play Balance: Even&#10;     Complexity: Very Complex&#10;     For Beginner: Very Poor&#10;     Play-By-Mail: Poor&#10;     Suggestion: Use of Optional Rules&#10;&#10;&#10;The rules were revised to a small extent in their second printing in June, 1966. These changes were described in the  Avalon Hill &#039;&#039;General&#039;&#039;, Volume 3. Number 2.&#10;&#10;"

5757,,Two players race to try to solve a mysterious case by collecting 7 consecutively-lettered evidence cards.&#10;&#10;Every turn a player increases his influence by placing a card next to an evidence pile. After that he has to estimate the total of the values of both players' cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Instead of increasing influence a player may dispute the opponent's bid. If the bid was too high (higher than the card total) the player may choose one evidence pile which is evaluated. Influence on this pile is rewarded with an evidence card.&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Ravensburger Fun For 2 Series.&#10;&#10;

Two correct answers give control of the card to the player. One correct answer gives control of the card to the player, but it can be stolen by another player who answers both questions on that player's card and identifies the photo. Once the deck is exhausted scoring is done by giving two points for each two-answered question card controlled by a player and one point for each one-answered question card.&#10;&#10;The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

If a 5 is rolled, it is a walk. A 6 is a strikeout. In both of these cases, the result is resolved according to the rules of baseball. Rolls of 1-4 require the player to answer a trivia question. An incorrect answer is an out, while a correct answer is a hit. A 1 is a single, 2 a double, 3 a triple and 4 a homer.&#10;&#10;A game lasts for 9 innings with the team with the most runs winning.&#10;&#10;This edition contains cards with questions about the Texas Rangers and their progenitor the Washington Senators.&#10;&#10;"

5765,,"The Game of Catholic Trivia has a very fitting title as it is just that, a trivia game about Catholicism. However, the creators have added some extra elements by splitting the questions into categories, rating the difficulty of the questions and tracking game progress using &quot;Bingo&quot; cards (they are referred to as such).&#10;&#10;When a player rolls the game die, the result corresponds to a number on his/her Bingo Card. The numbers are shown multiple times on the cards in different colours.  These colours correspond to a specific category of questions including &quot;Famous Martyrs, Saints and Sinners&quot; and &quot; History - Pre Vatican II&quot;. The number also corresponds to the level of difficulty of the question, that range from Easy to Extremely Difficult. If a player correctly answers the question, he/she places a token on the number and colour that was answered. If not, play passes to the next person. A roll of a 6 is a &quot;free will&quot; where a player may select whichever space wanted.&#10;&#10;The player wins with 5 tokens in a row, vertically or horizontally.&#10;&#10;"

Players represent commanding officers in control of the campaign for either side.&#10;&#10;Scenarios cover small portions of the battle, as well as the variable-length campaign game. The game focuses on the German offensive operations undertaken in the Caucasus. Campaign game options will allow players to experiment by altering the historical order of battle to determine just what the German possibilities for a victory were.

A piece can move as many spaces as the number of other pieces adjacent to it.  That's most of the rules right there - like Sid Sackson's other abstracts, it's fairly simple (to understand, not necessarily to play well).&#10;&#10;This is similar to Fields of Action, the rules to which were published in R. Wayne Schmittberger's New Rules for Classic Games (although originally considered for inclusion in Sid Sackson's own A Gamut of Games). However, that game is only for 2 players and has a few other differences.&#10;&#10;"

Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!&#10;&#10;A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.&#10;&#10;Nordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'.&#10;&#10;"

When one of a player's men reaches the top of a staircase, he gets treasure as well as the option of challenging the Polterdice (ghosts of the former inhabitants of the mansion whom you must &quot;capture&quot; for additional treasure) for more money.  If he loses the challenge, it goes to the next player on the staircase and so-on until someone wins or everyone loses.  The key mechanic is deciding how to &quot;spend&quot; your dice rolls on which men in which part of the mansion.&#10;&#10;The designers note that the game is inspired by Can't Stop, and is therefore dedicated to Sid Sackson (who died during the production of the title).&#10;&#10;"

As gestures for the 2 hands are written secretly, then revealed simultaneously, there is ample ground for feinting - starting a sequence leading to a certain attack, then switching to a different sequence, hoping your opponent doesn't call your bluff.&#10;&#10;The 40 different spells allow you to attack, defend, summon monsters, enchant your opponent (limit his or her play in different ways), and more.&#10;&#10;To win, you need to make creative use of the many options, and keep an open eye towards your opponent's schemes.

The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.&#10;&#10;10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.&#10;&#10;Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.&#10;&#10;But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course.

While traveling through the loops, the player lands on Operation spaces and Mr spaces. The Operational spaces allow players to draw operation cards which might help to reduce their millirems, cause them to lose a turn, or increase/decrease the temp in the reactor core. Mr spaces add radiation to the player's hand.&#10;&#10;Player's may also draw operation valve cards or other cards that might help them to effect a cold shutdown on the reactor. Valve cards prevent other players from moving around the loop. The challenge is in knowing when to shut down the reactor based on what you know about the other players' hands. Of course, the possibility also exists that the core temperature will rise to a meltdown point, which will also end the game.&#10;&#10;"
