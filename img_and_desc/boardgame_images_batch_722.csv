Net moves range from 0 (6-6=blown out a sail) to 5. Lower red rolls get help and higher ones get penalized.&#10;&#10;Unlike later games, the wind is assumed to blow constantly from the top of the board, and courses are laid out accordingly. The rules and realities of sailing apply: a boat on starboard tack has right of way over port; close-hauled over reaching or running; getting to windward of another boat hurts its movement, and so on.&#10;&#10;There are rules for tacking, luffing and setting spinnakers. There are shoals that players can try to get over but if their turn ends on a shoal they ground. There is an advanced start process too: instead of rolling for position with highest first, players can spend three turns manoeuvering for position as in a real race.&#10;&#10;The rulebook has extensive diagrams of various potential situations, and is designed to make the game instructive as well as fun for players who are not sailors.&#10;&#10;"

Each card features 1-3 birds in one of four colors &mdash; red, green, yellow, purple &mdash; with the reverse of the card having either the same number of birds in a different color or the same color of birds in a different number. Thus, each number+color combination appears five times in the deck.&#10;&#10;On a turn, choose a card in the grid, then flip it over. If you can add it to your collection, do so; if not, return the bird to the grid with the newly revealed side face up. Your goal is to collect sets of birds in a single color, with you needing to take the single bird first, then the pair, then the triplet. The first player to collect 2-4 sets wins, with the number being dependent on the number of players. Watch what others do, remember what was flipped where, and play the odds when deciding to flip the birds!&#10;&#10;"

If you draw a monster card, you roll appropriate dice for your attack, add any modifiers your character has, then subtract that number from the monster's hit points.  If the monster is still alive, you roll to see what attack it makes on your character.  Your character and monster fight until one of you dies.  If your character survives the fight, he or she gains one or more souls (VPs) and a number of coins (for spending at The Shop).  If your character does not survive, well ... we hope you have collected some souls so you can return to the game!  As a survivor of one or more monsters, you might draw a saving throw card from the Quest deck -- your character could gain treasure, hat racks, fruit, or a disaster!

The box and rules for the original game by Topeka, Kansas-based entrepreneur Harry E. Gavitt say it was covered by four copyrights and multiple patents dating as early as Sept. 15, 1896.&#10;&#10;The only thing it has in common with the Pit game developed by Edgar Cayce and first sold in 1904 is the open-outcry method for trading cards and the objective of being the first to collect a complete set.&#10;&#10;G-S-E, as it is also called on the box, is themed as a railway stock trading game rather than a commodities pit, and has a deck of only 49 cards: 8 shares in six railways plus a &quot;Fatal Telegram&quot; card. This compares with decks of 65 and 74 in Pit games. Similarly, G-S-E allows players to trade only one or two cards at a time, compared with a maximum of four for Pit.&#10;&#10;The play of the Telegram card is very different from the Bull and Bear cards used in Pit. It always starts with the dealer, and is added to the first trade that player makes. In other words, if the dealer trades two cards for two cards, the other player receives two plus the Telegram. That player in turn must include the Telegram in his next trade and so on. The Telegram has no benefit and at hand's end equals a penalty of $100 if held by the winner and $150 if held by anyone else.&#10;&#10;Scoring also differs from the later Pit. Railway shares are worth between $125 and $250 (a narrow range than in Pit). The player who first corners a railway must shout &quot;Topeka&quot; in honor of Gavitt's hometown, and scores double the value of his 8 rail cards. The other players, however, also score, each collecting the face value of his largest set. First player to $2,500 wins the game.&#10;&#10;Gavitt was determined to foster boisterous play, and his rules specify that bids must be made at least twice as loud as normal conversation, and that players must make their first offers as soon as they pick up their cards, and another every five seconds thereafter. Breaking these rules carries a penalty of $25 for each offense!&#10;&#10;"

The dealer for the round lays their cards out similarly. If the dealer's cat is in the same position as a player's cat, that player receives no points for the round, otherwise the player receives points equal to the sum of the cards from the left of their cat to the next player's cat.

The cats in the regular suits can be values of 1, 2, or 3, while the rare cats are only value 1. There are also &quot;item&quot; cards that give special abilities.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 3 cat cards in the player's &quot;yard.&quot; The vacant lot begins as 4 face up cat cards and the rest of the draw deck face down. There are two ways to obtain cards from the vacant lot. First, a player may simply draw from the face up cards either A) up to 2 cats of value 1, B) 1 cat of value 2 or 3, or C) all visible items. Alternatively, the player may take a card from the player's own yard and return it to the vacant lot, then draw the top card from the deck. If the top card matches any of the cards in the vacant lot, the player gains the drawn card plus any that match it. (If no cards match, the drawn card remains face up in the vacant lot.) This second option may be repeated as often as desired until the player gains cards.&#10;&#10;When gaining cards from the vacant lot, the player must be careful of the suit. The suit(s) in the player's yard with the most cards is considered threatening to cats in any other suits. If a player gains a card in a suit of which the player already has more cards than any other, one cat card in each of the suits with lower numbers of cats will return to the vacant lot due to fear.&#10;&#10;Points are awarded at the end based on the highest value cat in the yard in each suit. One point is added for the player with a majority in that suit, while one point is subtracted from each player who has at least one card in that suit but does not have the majority. Every player with 2 or fewer suits at the end of the game gets a &quot;maniac bonus&quot; of 3 points. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Radiation markers could be cleared away as an entire turn action of non-fighting and non-moving armies. H-Bombs were removed from the game completely.&#10;&#10;Eventually the GW licence would expire, and ownership and rights would revert to Mike Hayes, who then went on to re-publish his 2012 Classic Warlord version with the full map and H-Bombs restored and rules re-organised for the more classic gameplay from the earlier Red Box and Blue Box versions.&#10;&#10;"

The players are controlling a SWAT team attempting to bring a hostage situation to a successful resolution. The game uses resource management, press-your-luck, and grid-based combat mechanics. Six situation variables allow for the game to have a high replay value. Players must work together to use the time that is given to them by the Hostage Negotiator to purchase Team members and equipment, gather intelligence on the situation, and prepare a rescue plan. The longer players wait, the better equipment and personnel they will have, but the more chances that negotiations will go south. Once players choose to rescue the hostages, grid-based combat begins that resolves in about 15 minutes.&#10;&#10;The game is based on a hostage situation inside a bank. The situation cards are unknown at the beginning of the game (Hostage and Suspect #, Hostage and Suspect Positions, Equipment and, Motivation) Each game begins with an Arrival Situation that determines how much Time the players begin the game, and whether or not someone is injured and needs immediate rescue. In a multi-player game, one player is the Incident Commander and the other players control dedicated sides of the building.&#10;&#10;The first phase of the game is the Containment Phase. A round begins with the Incident Commander rolling a die to simulate negotiations. The result of the roll is how much Time the negotiator has &quot;bought&quot; for the other players. Each player then begins their turn buy using their Time to buy SWAT personnel from the stack to their staging area, moving SWAT from their staging area to the board, purchasing equipment, using SWAT personnel skills, moving, or gathering intelligence. Players can buy everything from a Medic to the Bomb Squad (once revealed) and Flash Bangs to Plastic Explosives. If players begin their turn with no Time, A card is drawn that has a negative effect for that player or the entire team to simulate the suspects doing something. Certain actions require the player to draw a reaction from the suspects that range from a gunshot heard inside with an unknown result to a hostage crawling out the window.&#10;&#10;At any time, or when the team is ready, the Incident Commander may initiate the Rescue Phase. All players move their squads to their breach points (windows/doors), breach doors and determine amount of surprise, reveal any unknown information, Snipers then shoot, Squads begin movement, squads then mark their shots simultaneously, once all shots are marked the shots are taken. Repeat the Snipers to shooting steps until surprise is over and then the suspects react by moving, shooting or surrendering until all the suspects have been neutralized or arrested.&#10;&#10;A quick-play version is comprised of scenarios that tell the players how to set up SWAT team members, equipment, and scenario cards. The players then skip the first phase of the game and go straight to the second phase, the Rescue Phase, to attempt to rescue the hostages. All scenarios can be played at various levels of difficulty by adding or subtracting equipment items that give the players bonuses.&#10;&#10;"

The game consists of a deck of 48 cars, 24 of which illustrate Faults and 24 illustrate matching Virtues. There also are four cards with a list of all the Faults and the Virtues that cancel their effects, and a set of four wooden racks.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt six blue-backed Faults and six red-backed Virtues. He puts his Faults upright in the racks facing away from him, so that others can see his Faults but he cannot. By looking at his opponents' Faults, a player must work out which Faults he has, and on his turn puts a Virtue from his hand on the table that will match one of his Faults.  If this Fault is in his rack, it is removed and discarded along with the Virtue from his hand.&#10;&#10;If a player feels that he does not have a needed Virtue in his hand, he may draw a card from the player on his right. If it matches one of his Faults, he discards both cards. If not, he must take one of the Faults from that player as a penalty. The first player to dispose of all his Faults wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Instead the game ends after a time limit, fixed number of turns or if the &quot;Snap election&quot; space is left uncovered the active player chooses to end the game.

Players will need to command armies of giants as they wage war throughout northwest Faer&ucirc;n. Order your giants to assault small folk villages and cities to score points and secure resources including food, artifacts, ore, and runes.&#10;&#10;Each player issues commands to their giants in the form of command cards (recruit, move, attack, pillage, and so on). This allows players to recruit new giants, send them out to attack settlements and other giants, and also to pursue special agendas based upon their race. Each player represents a different giant race (hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, or storm giants), each with a different agenda.  For example, the Storm Giants seek to restore their lost monarch, King Hekaton. The Cloud Giants seek an ancient dragon treasure trove, and the Hill Giants seek an abundance of food with which to feed their massive monarch, Chief Guh.&#10;&#10;Contents include 12 Giants miniatures, injection molded in color, measuring from approximately 60mm to over 90mm in height, and three Giantslayers.&#10;&#10;Preliminary FAQ: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-preliminary-faq&#10;&#10;Official Variants: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26201496&#10;&#10;"

(In Japan, there is a picture book named &quot;Hyakumankai Ikita Neko&quot; (The Cat That Lived a Million Times), and the game title is derived from that).&#10;&#10;Welcome to the department that claimed a million lives!&#10;&#10;You are assigned to a department that is said to have killed a million workers, and have four job cards to work on.&#10;&#10;You cannot finish your jobs without the part-time worker Miya-chan's help, so everyone competes to get her. When a player finishes all their jobs, her working time runs out and everyone else has to work over-time to finish their remaining jobs by themselves. Add up the face values of cards in their hand, and that's the over-time hours this week.&#10;&#10;If a player's total over-time exceeds 300 hours, that player suffers Karoshi (death from overwork) and loses the game. All other players win because the department gets investigated and all survivors are liberated from overworking.&#10;&#10;If all players survive four weeks without exceeding 300 hours, all players win the game.&#10;&#10;There are four types of cards in the game.&#10;(1) paperwork: Playable while you have control of Miya-chan to finish a job&#10;(2) snack: Playable in response to paperwork to gain

In Search and Survive players must work together to rescue survivors, gather resources, and complete objectives; all while attempting to keep the growing zombie threat in check. The zombies have unique abilities to challenge players with, and the Horde moves towards the players with the potential of moving off of the play area and damaging them.&#10;&#10;Unlike many games within the deck building genre, Search and Survive offers a unique combat system that blends card values with dice rolls. Failed attacks, zombie advancement, and zombie abilities can all cause players to take Damage cards. These cards not only dilute a player's deck, but are also a finite resource. If any one player takes their 10th Damage Card the game ends in defeat.&#10;&#10;In Search and Survive players must decide how far they want to push their luck on their turns. As ammunition depletes attacks become more dangerous. Melee attacks must also be considered carefully as close combat is riskier than ranged, but also has some powerful rewards. As combat resolves players take the spoils of war and add them to their decks, increasing their strength.&#10;&#10;Players must work together to complete the objective of the session. Rescued survivors, locations, useful items, and powerful weapons must be combined to ensure the survival of the human race.&#10;&#10;"
