The 60-card deck is divided into four suits of 15, each representing one of the four colleges. In addition to being numbered from 1 to 15, each suit contains cards with letters spelling out the name of its college. The object of the game is to complete the name of one of the four colleges using only the letters from its suit.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt five cards each, and five more go face-up on the field between them. Each player on his turn has the opportunity to capture cards on the field by playing a card that adds up to the same number (e.g. a 13 can be played to capture a 9 and 4). He plays until unable to capture any more, and then adds one of the cards from his hand to the field. When a player exhausts his hand, he gets a new hand of five cards.&#10;&#10;Players must declare which college they are playing for, and if there is competition for one, the first player to get the 15 of that suit takes over and the other player must go after a different college.&#10;&#10;Letter cards of the desired college are placed in front of the player as successfully used or captured, and the remaining cards go into a discard stack which becomes the replacement deck when needed. While two colleges have only four letters (PENN and YALE), the values of the letter cards ensure that each college is as hard to complete as the others (e.g. PENN has letter cards of 12, 13, 14 and 15, while PRINCETON includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 15).&#10;&#10;"

To start a round, each player takes a card from the top of their stack and places it face up in the center of the table. Then the player tries to collect 3 of a kind by discarding a card from their hand and collecting one from the center of the table. There are no turns - players collect cards simultaneously. As soon as a player has 3 of a kind, he or she performs the secret signal described on the secret signal card (e.g. touch your nose, tap the table, etc...). If the player's partner sees the signal and shouts 'BOOM!' that team wins the round. If an opponent sees the signal and shouts 'SNIP!' the opponent's team wins the round. The first team to reach 10 points wins (7 points for a 6 player game).&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bluff! Send fake signals to make your opponents mistakenly say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo;. &#10;     Watch what explosives your opponents are collecting. Enjoy the look of surprise on their faces when you say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo; before they have even made their signal. &#10;     Alternatively, if you see an opponent collecting a particular explosive, grab it when it appears on the table before they manage to grab it themselves. &#10;     Even better, if you already have an opponent&rsquo;s card in your hand, play it and say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo; as soon as he or she picks it up. &#10;     You should also watch what your partner is collecting, maybe you have a card he or she can use. &#10;     Watch for players who aren&rsquo;t collecting any cards, they probably have collected 3 of a kind already. &#10;     Confuse your opponent by constantly dropping and collecting extra cards so that they can&rsquo;t see what explosives you are really collecting. &#10;     There are blank signal cards in the Signals deck. Make up your own signals. &#10;     For more advanced players - don&rsquo;t use the Signals deck at all!

The more matches you make the more points you earn.  The honeybee is wild and can be connected with any symbol.

Choose the one that suits your mood.&#10;  &#10;Version A &ndash; Worker Bee&#10;   Fast-paced competition between opponents&#10;   (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)&#10;&#10;1. Divide tiles evenly among all players/teams. &#10;   2 players = 26 tiles each, 3 players = 17 tiles each, 4 players = 13 tiles each&#10;2. Each player places their tiles face-down in front of themselves.&#10;3. On the word &lsquo;go&rsquo; players turn over their tiles and connect as many matching symbols as possible. It&rsquo;s a race to complete your honeycomb before &#10;  your opponents complete theirs.&#10;4. The first player to connect all their tiles together yells &ldquo;HONEYCOMBS&rdquo;. &#10;   This signifies the end of the round and all other players must immediately stop. &#10;5. Players quickly check the honeycomb of the player nearest to them to see if anyone has broken rules 1 and/or 2 (see rules 1 &quot;Single Match&quot; &amp; 2 &#10;   below). If so, deduct points accordingly. However, if the player finishing first is in violation of the rules, the round &#10;   resumes until someone finishes with a mistake free honeycomb.&#10;6. Next, each player calculates their points for the round - (See Scoring) and tells the scorekeeper. The scorekeeper keeps a running tally of &#10;   everyone&rsquo;s points.&#10;7. Return all tiles to the bag to prepare for another round.&#10;8. The player with the most points after 3 rounds is crowned Queen Bee.&#10;&#10;Version B &ndash; One Big Honeycomb&#10;   A leisurely competition, one turn at a time&#10;  (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)&#10;&#10;1. Players take turns to build one big honeycomb while collecting individual points.&#10;2. Draw one tile and place it face up in the center of the table.&#10;3. Each player draws three tiles from the bag.&#10;4. Moving clockwise, players choose one of their three tiles and connects it to the honeycomb. One point is earned for every match made and it is added &#10;   the player&rsquo;s total.&#10;5. After each turn, players draw one tile from the bag to replenish their hand.&#10;6. When all 52 tiles have been connected to the honeycomb, the game is over and the player with the most points is the champion.&#10;7. Some tiles have special powers which are indicated in the center of the tile. To maximize their value, be strategic in how you use them. They are &#10;   only active in Version B- One Big Honeycomb.&#10;&#10;Special Power Tiles.&#10;&#10;Double Points: When playing a tile marked with the Double Points symbol &quot;2X&quot;, all points earned are doubled.&#10;&#10;Steal: When playing a tile marked with the Steal symbol (picture of a masked robber) you have the power to steal another player&rsquo;s turn. Before &#10;               a player lays their tile, yell &ldquo;STEAL&rdquo; to indicate you are stealing their turn. Lay your &lsquo;Steal&rsquo; tile and collect your points. &#10;               Replenish your hand to 3 tiles.  Continue with the next scheduled player.&#10;&#10;Extra Turn: After taking your normal turn, you can play the Extra Turn tile (tile marked with a symbol of an arrow in a circle) &#10;               right away. It is a bonus turn and does not affect your next turn. Replenish your hand to 3 tiles&#10;&#10;Wild Tile: When playing the tile with the &quot;bee&quot; symbol in the center of the tile the player chooses 1 symbol on this tile to become wild. It can &#10;               now be matched with any symbol.  *note: this is not to be confused with the wild bee on the perimeter of the tile.&#10;&#10;Version C &ndash; Honeycombs Puzzle&#10;   Work together to build a creative honeycomb&#10;&#10;1. All tiles are placed face up on the table as you would with a puzzle.&#10;2. Players work together to build one honeycomb.  The object of this game is to make as many connections as possible.&#10;3. Tiles can be moved around at any time, by any player.&#10;4. Work at your own pace as everyone contributes at the same time.&#10;5. When all tiles are connected to the players&rsquo; satisfaction the game is over.&#10;6. This is a non-competitive version; count the total points and record your score if you want.&#10;&#10;Rules&#10;&#10;Rule 1: Single Match (Applies to Worker Bee Version Only)&#10;When a round is finished, only one tile in a players honeycomb can have a single match. A single match is a one that is isolated (the symbols on either side of it are not matched). This means you cannot string tiles together in a train to finish quickly.&#10;&#10;Rule 2: Mismatched Connection&#10;If a mismatched connection is discovered when the round ends, the player must remove the tile with the mismatch without receiving any points&#10;for it. For example, a player may need to remove a tile and forfeits 2 points even though 1 of the connections was a match.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;1 match = 1 point&#10;1 core connection = 5 points&#10;Unused tile = minus 1 point (Worker Bee Version Only)&#10;&#10;How to Score&#10;1. Count your core connection points first&#10;2. Count your matches. To ensure accuracy when counting, points should be tallied while you disassemble your honeycomb. As you remove each tile, count &#10;   the number of matches it has. (see picture below)&#10;3. Minus your negative points.&#10;&#10;Core Connection&#10;&#10;A core connection is a tile that has matched all 6 sides. In the One Big Honeycomb version, the player who placed the 6th and final tile earns the&#10;core connection bonus of 5 points. This bonus is in addition to the points received from the connection(s) themselves.&#10;&#10;"

Face-up SD Cards can no longer be used to attack but can still be attacked by your opponent. They remain on the Battlefield until they have been defeated.&#10;&#10;3. The DEFENDER is now given the chance to attack. Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 with the DEFENDER now as the ATTACKER.&#10;&#10;4) Repeat steps 1-3 until a player defeats an opponent&rsquo;s battleship. A player defeats their opponent&rsquo;s battleship by defeating 3 of their SD Cards thus sending them to the Discard Area. If there are not enough SD Cards on the Battlefield for a player to defeat 3 of their opponent&rsquo;s cards, the player who defeats more of their opponent&rsquo;s SD Cards wins the battle.&#10;&#10;5) The winner sends their opponent&rsquo;s battleship back one space on the Command Board and moves their victorious battleship to the previously occupied space.&#10;&#10;     If the losing battleship cannot move back a space due to another battleship obstructing its movement, the losing battleship is destroyed and removed from the Command Board.&#10;     If the losing battleship cannot move back because it is at the back (1st Row) of the Command Board, the losing battleship is destroyed and removed from the Command Board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Assign Stage:&#10;Place one SD Card from your hand face down on any unoccupied space on the Battlefield. One Power Supply Point is required when placing an SD Card on the Battlefield. The SD Symbol of the chip must match the Symbol of the card being placed.&#10;&#10;"

Movement is determined by a die. Numbered spaces hinder or benefit the players. If a pawn reaches a space with an opponent pawn on it, the later has to go back to the space, the other pawn has come from. After completing a circle around the game board, the pawns advance to the inner circle and lastly the coat of arms.&#10;&#10;This game was likely published about 1930.&#10;&#10;"
