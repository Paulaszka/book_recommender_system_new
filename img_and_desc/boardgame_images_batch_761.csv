The focus is squarely on the operational level, and the ability of your subordinates to carry out your orders - to march a given distance in a day, to avoid battle, or to coordinate their attacks - is not entirely within your control. This uncertainty is simulated by a series of die rolls. (Don't worry about &quot;wristage&quot;; in practice, it's only a few rolls per turn.)&#10;&#10;A number of chromey bits effortlessly recreate the particulars of this campaign without ever getting in the way of your decision-making and agency.

Each card represents a piece of a triangle, numbered 1-3. The triangles are &quot;cut&quot; in one of three ways (horizontal, vertical and centered cut) which works as suits, and the numbers 1, 2 and 3 of the same cut make a complete triangle.&#10;&#10;There are 81 triangle pieces and 9 whole triangles (jokers) in each deck.&#10;&#10;Each installment in the Triangles series has a distinct visual theme and rules for two games: a base game titled &quot;Triangle Mayhem&quot; and a bonus game only introduced in that particular installment, however any Triangles game can be played with any of the decks.&#10;&#10;The bonus game in &quot;Triangles: Original is titled &quot;Triangle Tricks&quot;, and the deck features photographic artwork from the world cities of Sydney, Los Angeles and London.&#10;&#10;TRIANGLE MAYHEM: Complete triangles by playing cards (triangle pieces) at the center of the table. The table is free for all meaning anyone can start a new triangle, continue an existing triangle, or complete a triangle by playing the final missing piece. Multiple triangles can be in the making simultaneously and whoever completes a triangle scores its cards.&#10;&#10;TRIANGLE TRICKS: A trick-taking game with a twist where the highest number (1-3, joker) takes the trick. In the event that two players are tied the same trick continues and all players - even those who played a low card - are still in the game. Points can can quickly stack up and experienced players will know when to play low cards, trusting that other players will tie to keep the trick going for another round.&#10;&#10;"

The first in 2016 was a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; released by USAOpoly, with gameplay essentially identical to standard Monopoly. The colored properties are locations from the first movie. The &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; replaces the railroads with a Taxi Cab, a Subway Car, a Fire Truck and a Police Car, and the Utilities are now the Keymaster and the Gatekeeper. The Chance and Community Chest cards are renamed &quot;I AIN'T AFRAID OF NO GHOST&quot; and &quot;WHO YA GONNA CALL&quot;, respectively, and contain themed rewordings of the standard rewards &amp; penalties. Houses and Hotels are replaced with Ghost Traps and Storage Facilities (the latter looking something like the Firehouse). Game pieces are the Ecto-1, Slimer, a PKE Meter, a Proton Pack, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and a Terror Dog.&#10;&#10;The second in 2020 was the &quot;Who You Gonna Call&quot; edition, released by Hasbro Gaming. It has several gameplay changes: &#10;(1) the two card decks are combined in a single &quot;Roaming Vapor&quot; deck that goes into a special Ghost Trap card holder that plays the movie theme; (2) the railroads are replaced with &quot;ECTO-1&quot; spaces that, when you land on them, allow you to buy your way to any space between that space and the next &quot;ECTO-1&quot; space for M50; &#10;(3) the Tax and Utility spaces are replaced with &quot;Supernatural Entity&quot; spaces, where you and the player on your left each roll one die, and if the combined total equals or exceeds the number on the space, you and the other player collect the cash listed on the space, but if you don't, you both have to PAY the amount listed to the Bank.&#10;Again, the colored properties are locations from the first movie (sorted and named differently from the previous version), but the Title Deeds are renamed &quot;Contracts&quot; in this version. Houses and Hotels are replaced with Ghost Traps and Containment Units (looking like the actual Storage Unit mounted to a section of brick wall). Game pieces in this version retain the PKE Meter and Proton Pack, but replace the others with a Walkie Talkie, a set of Ecto-Goggles, Janine Melnitz's glasses &amp; Dana Barrett's cello.&#10;&#10;"

Higher cards must be supported from below, and they cost more to build, with payment being made when constructed. The new step triggers production from the cards in the pyramid to the left and right, going down from the active card, so planning ahead is very important to success.

You are a biologically engineered &quot;Super-Bug&quot;, and must fight for survival. Dive inside the human body to experience the combative microcosm inside all of us.&#10;&#10;Basic Overview&#10;&#10;Bio-Logic is a fast-paced, hybrid tile-placement/dungeon crawler game that allows 2-6 players to infect and manipulate the world around them for ultimate domination. 6 unique &quot;Super-Bugs&quot; are pitted against one another in a battle to the death, inside the human body. Your goal is to infect as much of the body as possible and destroy all the other invasive Bugs. Ensure your survival by utilizing choice character development, performing combat, and strategizing tile placement. The game's system is balanced enough for anyone to jump in. At the same time, it's deep enough to offer, nearly, infinite potential for strategy. In Bio-Logic, resources are limited and foes are many, so you must adapt and evolve or you will certainly fade from existence.&#10;&#10;Unique Character Development&#10;&#10;All players begin with a choice stat bonus and a special inherent traits These traits can grant special boosts and bonus rewards, manipulate player or enemy stats, or protect oneself from the reactive world. Every Bug has its own advantage/strategy with the capacity to evolve new abilities.&#10;&#10;Combat/Infecting....Vs. World, Vs. Players&#10;&#10;Developing ones Bug, involves infecting the world around you for stat boosting rewards. Some tiles are infected instantly. However, greater rewards are reserved for combat. Those who attempt to infect the vital organs, must use combat. There are 3 levels of tiles for a player to choose from as they grow. Each tier offers greater obstacles but with greater rewards for the victor.&#10;&#10;Players also have the option of fighting one another to steal resources and abilities. Some Bugs are better made for this than others. You can use this feature to sabotage the lead players advance, steal your favorite choice abilities, or monopolize a tile type. Bio-Logic is all about choice and strategy, but you must push forward at all costs, for hesitation will bring only certain defeat.&#10;&#10;Tile-Placement/World Manipulation&#10;&#10;While building your character and fighting for resources, the human you infect is also attempting to eradicate you. Special enemy tiles have the ability to instantly alter many in-game stats. But it's not totally out of your control, you have a choice in how you reveal the board. The way you place tiles plays a big role in how the game progresses. Some enemies have effects that can activate as soon as the tile is put into play, while others wait until they are infected to cause a reaction. Not only does your development need attention, but so does the evolving world in which you live. Bio-Logic is always changing and you must learn to adapt if you are to survive.&#10;&#10;Final Words&#10;&#10;Bio-Logic takes you into an environment unlike any other. With 3 random draw piles, choice tile placement, special abilities, and limited resources no game is ever the same. On any given turn you must make decisions that affect the entire game world, altering everyone's future. It's a delicate dance where you must evaluate every aspect of development to ultimately claim victory over your friends. In Bio-logic, you must master your universe or get wiped from existence.&#10;&#10;"

The left and right edges of the board are colored white; the top and bottom edges are colored black.&#10;&#10;DEFINITIONS&#10;A piece is a single stone or two stacked stones in a single space.&#10;A weak pair is a set of two like-colored, diagonally adjacent pieces such that there is no like-colored piece orthogonally adjacent to both.&#10;The rank of a weak pair is the number of stones in that weak pair. This value can range from 2 to 4.&#10;A crosscut is a 2x2 set of pieces consisting of two diagonally adjacent black pieces and two diagonally adjacent white pieces.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE&#10;The goal of Consta is to form a connected chain of your pieces linking the opposite edges of the board marked by your color. I.e. White should connect the Left and Right edges and Black should connect the Top and Bottom edges. A corner is considered to be part of both adjoining edges.&#10;&#10;You win when you have a connected chain at the end of the opponent&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;Two pieces are considered to be connected to each other if they are:&#10;- orthogonally adjacent or&#10;- diagonally adjacent and: the weak pair doesn't belong to a crosscut or the weak pair is the highest rank weak pair that belongs to a crosscut.&#10;&#10;No draws are possible in Consta.&#10;&#10;PLAY&#10;The game begins with an empty board.

At first, the surroundings seem like paradise, but life soon proves difficult. Water and food are scarce. It&rsquo;s doubtful whether everyone can survive this diet. There is only one solution: Construct a large raft together. But don&rsquo;t waste any time, because the clouds on the horizon suggest the arrival of a dangerous hurricane! At the end of the game, the players who manage to leave the island in time will win (assuming anyone survives that long!).&#10;&#10;"

Command a landship (the original British term for tanks) to clear a sector of enemy infantry, artillery, and landships.&#10;&#10;The player chooses either side of the 3 player cards to create either a single high powered landship with a main cannon and side sponsons, or a lesser armed landship plus a corvette class landship or squad of shock troops.&#10;&#10;The player then chooses either side of each of the 6 enemy cards to create the enemy forces - a collection of enemy landships, artillery, infantry, and mine fields arranged in 2 rows of 3 cards.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the player will roll 3 6-sided dice and assign each die to each of their cards to attack the enemies.  Then, for the enemy turn, roll the 3 dice and assign them low to high left to right across the front enemy line, then take the assigned actions.&#10;&#10;Each card has its own damage track.  When a card is destroyed, it is removed from the game.  Win by destroying all 6 enemy cards.  Lose if the enemy destroys your landship.&#10;&#10;Cover art and card background images are public domain art from WWI artist Muirhead Bone.&#10;&#10;Pocket Landship was entered in BGG's 2017 9 Card Nanogame PnP Design Contest.&#10;&#10;"
