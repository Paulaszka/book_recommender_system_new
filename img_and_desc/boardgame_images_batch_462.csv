Luck on the black or blue roll can bring you directly on the green in which case you can skip all other dice and proceed with the putter.

The green DD cube establishes the format of play (i.e. NL - No Look hand, R - reverse direction, Star - extra wild in play, etc.). The red DD indicator is bad luck (roller loses a die) and the green DD indicator is good luck (roller gets to return a previously lost die to their hand). Rolling double DD's has a special consequence! All players shake their colored dice in their shaker cup and throw down keeping their dice concealed from the others. Ones are wild and a player's turn requires a bet to be made which is based upon all the dice in play. Bets will continue to be increased until a player challenges another players bet.

Each player has 4 round-shaped and 4 square-shaped tokens numbered from 1 to 4. The tokens have two sides, one of them with a black frame. On a turn, a player places one of their tokens on a free space on the game board. When all spaces have been occupied, it's time to check the effects of each token on the opponent's neighboring tokens. The square tokens work horizontally and vertically whereas the round tokens work diagonally. A token is considered conquered if the score of the pieces surrounding it is higher than its own value. It is then turned onto its black framed side. The winner is the player with the most points (i.e., a higher difference between the points of the pieces they conquered and the points of your pieces conquered by the opponent).&#10;&#10;Originally published in spielbox 1991 #6.&#10;&#10;"
