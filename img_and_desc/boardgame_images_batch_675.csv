June, 1941, as a German platoon leader you will fight your way across Russia in a tactical tour de force. Each month you will take part in engagements against a random number of Soviet squads and accumulate victory points which facilitate promotion, unit upgrades and awards.  Single, tournament style engagements or one of two campaigns may be played.  Designed from the ground up as a solitaire system, the game's brain is an innovative hex template that is used for unit placement.  This primary system works in concert with a proven chit pull sub-system and action charts which dictate if an enemy unit moves (if so what direction) fires, or does nothing. The map is framed by a slew of information which you must keep track of including: squad action points, leader action points, sudden death track, sniper track, month track, weather, initial German deployment, expected level of enemy resistance, engagement type (three possible types), arty/air strikes, and a victory point track.  The map is a generic, base map upon which terrain tiles are configured according to the given scenarios or simply your own whim! Combat is comprised of a combat results table that determines the number of step losses and subsequent pinned, suppressed or broken results.  Or, you may chuck the primary combat engine for an alternative &quot;buckets&quot; of dice combat engine!  Close combat is brutal and there are no guarantees in this game. Units will often have to roll to perform an action,and at game start, you will have to spot an enemy before you can fire at it. Finally, all of this occurs on a modest 7x9 hex grid!&#10;&#10;"

At the height of World War II, spies from around the world descended on Berlin, Germany to gain intelligence on military operations. Allied forces from countries including United States, England, and Russia engaged in dangerous clandestine operations, code breaking, and subterfuge. The secrets they obtained thwarted military advancements into Western and Eastern Europe. Now, you, the agent behind enemy lines in Berlin in the early 1940s, seek to decipher the enemy plans, avoid being caught by the Schutzstaffel, and uncover the double agent among your peers.&#10;&#10;Gameplay. Operation Berlin is a mystery board game with a defector. The goal is to determine which military operation Nazi Germany is planning through process of elimination. Players move as spies through Berlin obtaining information and avoiding hindrances in the form of roadblocks, security guards, and Schutzstaffel. As an added challenge, players may be double agents trying to prevent the other agents from discovering the German plans. This game combines the mystery style of Clue with the player interaction of Resistance to create a unique and intriguing replaying of history.&#10;&#10;Mystery Element: There are 9 possible missions characterized by the country of attack and type of attack. One of the missions is selected at random, unknown to the players, and placed aside as the actual secret mission. A tracking sheet assists players in eliminating possible missions when they find or trade information on what cards are not in the secret mission pile. First player to accurately guess the secret mission wins!&#10;&#10;Defector: Based on the number of players there may be 1 or 2 double agents. By randomly drawing the agent and double agents cards at the beginning, no one knows what side the other players are on. This adds a covert element that will have players interacting, accusing, and defending until the truth is known. Double agents may choose at any point in the game to reveal their secret, allowing them to play as the German forces. If the double agent remains incognito, all players may accuse a person of being a double agent and force them to be uncovered. But if they guess wrong the game ends in a German victory!&#10;&#10;"

One player assumes the role of the Union, the other plays Confederate units, meeting on the field of battle. In skirmish after skirmish, players deploy their forces card after card, fighting gallantly for their nation's survival.&#10;&#10;Each of the two decks contain 72 cards, from the volunteer infantry with aged muskets, to the advanced firepower of artillery and cavalry.

MPoS takes the core mechanic in an entirely new direction by introducing exploration and trade in a multi-player science fiction setting.
