Each tile has different patterns on the front and back, and no two tiles are alike.  Thus, each pattern appears four times.  So, for example, each of the four tiles showing the rose pattern has a different one of the remaining four patterns on the reverse side.&#10;&#10;The tiles are randomly placed on the table on their sides on so that each player sees exactly one of the two patterned faces of each tile (the players sit across from each other). The first player rotates one tile 90 degrees so that it is standing up.  Next, the other player topples it either towards or away from herself (she chooses) so that one of the two patterned sides is now face up.  She then puts the tile into a pile on the side of the table so that the revealed patterned side remains face up.  After completing these steps, the players reverse roles.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to build a complete 2-D tile pyramid, with four tiles in the bottom layer, three tiles in the second layer, two tiles in the third layer and one tile on top. When building on the second or higher layers, a tile can only be placed if it matches the face up pattern of one of the tiles it is being placed on.  The pyramid can be built in any order (e.g., work on the second layer can begin before the bottom layer is completed).&#10;&#10;Players may not communicate verbally or otherwise.&#10;&#10;"

Prodigious beings appear on the battlefields to support the Wehrmacht's efforts: flying men shower flames upon the enemy; women wearing iron masks punch through tank armour; bloodthirsty beasts devour entire regiments. The world is about to succumb to the might of the Third Reich. Aaron Spiegelmann, a Jewish scientist who escaped from the Mauthausen concentration camp, is the only hope for the Allied Forces to stop the Nazis. Spiegelmann is the genius who created the Wunderkammer, a new technology that allowed the Germans to create real superheroes with extraordinary powers.

As the war rages on and every army creates its own Meta-Humans and war machines, Natural Prodigies, unscrupulous Adventurers and even secretive groups of Warlocks step into battle. From the European battlefields to the Pacific Islands, a conflict like never before is unleashed and spreads with no boundaries: humanity will forever remember it as the first War of Wonders.&#10;&#10;"
