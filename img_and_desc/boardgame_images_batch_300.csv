Using a limited supply of &quot;build points&quot;, the players build pyramids, obelisks, statues and temples in and around Egypt. The Ramses II player also has the opportunity to denounce or deface the monuments of his predecessor. After the players have exhausted their build points, they determine when and if each monument is discovered (by die roll for the years 1880, 1912, and 2006). Points are scored based on the piety value of the buildings and the grandeur of buildings discovered in the future, bestowing each player's pharaoh with titles ranging from &quot;The Great&quot; to &quot;The Weak.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: &#10;&#10;     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). &#10;     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. &#10;     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.&#10;&#10;&#10;All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&#10;Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:&#10;&#10;1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, high to low, or low to high. In LCBG, you must go low to high.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;There are more differences that are non-substantive. (Art, points in LCBG multiplied by 5, etc.)&#10;&#10;"

Communication and deal making are very important enhancements to a player&rsquo;s game strategy. A few choice words can help your portfolio or have the opposite effect on your opponent&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s all about opportunities, timing and the hustle.&#10;&#10;There are two main objectives players engage in while playing Big Board Raiders; the first is to get elected by proxy as a director of a company and the second is to grow your portfolio using the many investment vehicles, so that you will have the capital to make your move to control your company; the company in which you were elected to the board by proxy. There are four trading companies: Yellow, Blue, Red, and Green. Six Subsidiaries, and each of these subsidiaries has a proxy vote that it gives to the players as they land on their subsidiary space on the game board.

INTRODUCTION&#10;With the hero's success in destroying the Black Knight's plan in Dawn, it took longer for him to organise his minions. But the time has come at last, the Great War has begun! Backed up by a very strong Dark Magic, he commands a huge army of Greenskins including the fierce  Goblorcs, unnatural Beasts, and now the Ice Monsters and even the Undeads have joined his army. The worst part is the Light Sword's new power -- the Black Knight now can heal his minions around him, including himself, in seconds!&#10;&#10;Approaching from the west , in a very short time three castles have fallen to his hands, and his armies are swiftly heading to the capital of D. Once again everything seems hopeless and the King of D has called the 18 legendary heroes to gather in the Dungeon of D, deep in the Forest of D to the south, where legend says that centuries ago the Great Wizard of D hid the Amulet of D'eugor. It is believed that only the legendary Amulet of D'eugor can nullify the Light Sword&rsquo;s power. Unfortunately, the Black Knight knew about this too, so he placed a very strong magical barrier on the entrance to keep anyone from entering.&#10;&#10;Luckily, the King has also summoned Daryn and Derek. They can combine their magical abilities to open the barrier for a very short time, allowing just one person to enter the dungeon. But even with their combined power, they can only do this once every three hours. So, one by one the 18 heroes enter the dungeon, hoping to find the Amulet of D'eugor and survive to exit the dungeon. So far no one has returned&hellip; and you are hero number 18, the last person to enter the dungeon. Daryn looks into your eyes before you enter the crack in the barrier. &quot;Please, you are our last hope&hellip;&quot; You nod a little, then jump in&hellip;.&#10;&#10;2. THE MISSION&#10;Get out of the dungeon alive as rich as you can. And if you are able to, bring the Amulet of D&rsquo;eugor!!&#10;&#10;Download the game on the Free Games section here: www.jackdgames.com&#10;&#10;"
