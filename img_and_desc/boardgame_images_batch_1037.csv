Your manager has told you to get out there and 'SELL, SELL SELL!' as you take to the Grandstands to move as many hot dogs as you can to keep the crowd happy and in their seats.&#10;In the game Hot Diggity Dog, 2 to 5 players grab their trusty hot dog supply box and hit the Grandstands, looking to turn their carefully selected inventory into fistfuls of cash. Moving quickly but strategically around the sections, they look for opportunities to turn dogs into dollars and make the most of the seven innings before the concessions begin to close down.&#10;&#10;In every inning of the game, each player has 5 action points to take any combination of the actions listed below to increase their sales.  &#10;With these points, they can:&#10;- Fulfill a hot dog order (1 AP)&#10;- Move to an adjacent (no diagonals) Grandstand section (1 AP)&#10;- Hawk your hot dogs to the crowd, adding another order to the section you are in (1 AP)&#10;- Play a 'Dog Eat Dog' card (1 AP)&#10;- Return to the commissary and restock your supply box (2 AP)&#10;&#10;An event is revealed from the Huge-0-Tron deck at the top of every inning, potentially altering the course of play for the next turn. Players must also be on their toes and watch for opportunities to capture extra points by fulfilling the combination showing on the top card of the Incentive deck.  There is also an optional player interaction deck, the Dog Eat Dog deck, which allows you to get hands on in thwarting the efforts of your fellow vendors while you seize crazy opportunities to better your own position.&#10;&#10;Carefully choose your route through the Grandstands, manage your delicious inventory, and seize the best opportunities to turn dogs into dollars to claim the spot as 'Top Dog' by the time the last 'Out' is called!&#10;&#10;"

You want to be present in all of these areas, preferably at just the right time to maximize your earnings. The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards. Each player chooses a card from hand, then passes the remaining cards to the next player, then each player plays their card in turn, beginning with the round's start player and typically placing a diamond-shaped token of their color in the location depicted on that card:&#10;&#10;&#10;     In the Workshops, you score 1 point for each of your tokens in a connected group with the newly placed token, doubling that score if you played on a pigment field.&#10;     In the Residences, you score the listed number of points, and if your token is preceded in the line by one or more tokens of your color, you score those previously played tokens again.&#10;     In the Townspeople area, you score 1, 3 or 6 points based on the height of your token in the pyramids, but you can only place at higher levels if the lower spaces are filled. Double your points if the card symbol matches the space your filled. Supporting tokens score again as higher tokens are placed.&#10;     In the Trade shops, four types of goods are present, and when you place a token, each token on that goods type scores for its owner points equal to the number of goods of that type now covered.&#10;     In the Harbor, you move your ship equal to the number on the played card, scoring points based on the space where you land, then place a token in one of the five rows. When that row is filled with three ships, each token in that row scores for its owner 1/3/6/10 points depending on the number of trade goods in that row.&#10;&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you can play a card for ship movement points and not place a token on the game board.&#10;&#10;Each player plays four cards in a round (in a 3 or 4 player game), then adds the last card in hand to those displayed beside the game board, then the start player marker rotates and you begin a new round.&#10;&#10;For each of the five areas, you can meet a certain condition that allows you to play a bonus card from those beside the game board, e.g., in the Workshops when you place the third card that surrounds a bonus card symbol, or in the Trade shops when you score a goods type that gives someone else more points than you. When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.&#10;&#10;When someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Their task is to play the role of a wise sorcerer defending the fortress and collect four treasures before the ghost reaches the top of the castle tower.&#10;&#10;How to play?&#10;Although you all play on the sorcerer&rsquo;s team, each player makes their own moves each turn. Of course, this does not mean that you cannot consult other players &ndash; many sorcerers are better than one! Each turn starts with drawing three cards in a pile and putting them in a row. The youngest sorcerer on the team starts their turn and then performs the moves indicated by the cards in order (left to right). After the moves are completed, the used cards are put aside and the next three cards are drawn and put in a row by the next player. You can also play alone and go on a creative and exciting adventure when there are no other board game lovers nearby!&#10;&#10;You can draw:&#10;&#10;     arrow cards: move the sorcerer to an adjacent field on the board, in the direction indicated by the arrow. NOTE: in each turn, you can rotate up to two of these cards by 90&deg; in any direction, or you can leave them as they were lined up;&#10;     loop cards: repeat the movements indicated by the cards to the left of this card twice, one by one, if this card is placed first from the left, it remains inactive;&#10;     sorcerer cards: move to any of adjacent fields on the left, right, above or below;&#10;     ghost cards: move the ghost token one field up.&#10;&#10;&#10;There are special fields on the board, which may make it easier (or more difficult) for you to collect treasures:&#10;&#10;     if you enter a teleportation gate field, you can magically move the sorcerer to any other gate field;&#10;     if you enter or pass through a field with a sorcerer&rsquo;s wand, you &#10;&#10;&#10; can move the ghost token one field down;&#10;&#10;     you cannot stop or pass through the ghost fields; turn the arrows to walk around them.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you enter the treasure field, put it in one of the boxes at the top of the board. If you use all the cards before the end of the game, shuffle them carefully and stack them again (since there are 35 cards, only two cards are dealt in the last turn). If the sequence you draw makes movement impossible (for example: even after turning the cards you hit a ghost field or you can&rsquo;t walk because of the end of the route), you move the ghost token one field up. You will win if you collect all the treasures before the ghost moves to the last field of its route and leaves the castle tower.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;"
