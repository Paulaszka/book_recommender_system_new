You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color.

Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.&#10;&#10;If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.&#10;&#10;When a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck.

Simply escaping the dungeon, making the most matches, being the last one alive are all valid goals for which to strive.

Players pick up 6 cards at the beginning of each round and play their hands simultaneously, building what they can and trying to trade with each other.  At the end of each round, a player may hold no more than 2 cards to carry into the next round.  The cards represent little buildings or territories, each of which are worth a certain number of points.  More advanced buildings require less advanced buildings to be completed first, structured around a low-impact, discoverable tech tree.&#10;&#10;The graphics contain paths and other elements that allow players to position the cards to create an aerial view of their village over the course of the game.  Each card is worth a few points; the game ends when any village is worth over 20 points, and the player with the most points in his village wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

In a round, each player plays each card one by one by (1) adding it as a new separate animal, (2) adding it to a pile as another animal of an existing type, or (3) flipping the card to reveal its property, then placing it under an existing animal stack to grant its power (or drawback) to the animals in that stack.&#10;&#10;In the climate phase that follows, the first player lays out colored cubes to represent how much food is available in this round (red chips), how many refugees are present (green chips), and how many parasites appeared (black chips).

During the extinction phase that follows, unfed animals die as do animals attacked by parasites or predators.&#10;&#10;Players then get a new deck of cards and the game continues with a new round. When the deck runs out and the final round ends, players scores two points for each of their living animals, one point for each property, and any bonuses from card combinations.

Players have 5 different game play styles to choose from and can play with different amounts of cards, in a half deck, full deck, or custom deck format. This is an &ldquo;E-Rated&rdquo; card game, sure to get your family involved, and easy enough for anyone to enjoy.&#10;&#10;There are 10 decks to choose from: Ninja, Pirates, Aliens, Robots, Monsters, Undead, Ghosts, Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to bridge the gap between games for really young children such as: &quot;Uno,&quot; &quot;Crazy 8's,&quot; and &quot;Old Maid,&quot;  and games for older children such as:  &quot;Magic the Gathering,&quot; &quot;Pokemon,&quot; etc.  It is designed to be an easy to pick up and play card game for children ages 6+, families, and casual players.  There are multiple ways to play the game, multiple decks to build, and players can even make up rules once they get comfortable with the gameplay. The trading card and custom deck options are just that...options, and are not required to play the game, unless you want to, and that is always welcomed!&#10;&#10;War Fighters can be played by anyone, of any age, at any time, in multiple ways, without having to spend hours on rules getting confusing.&#10;&#10;Basic Game Play (#1):&#10;-Divide one deck in half evenly and give each half to a player.&#10;-Each player will receive:  5 square fighters (Paper), 5 circle fighters (Rock), 5 ex fighters (Scissors), 4 attacks, 2 blocks, 2 truces, and 2 star leader fighter cards for a total of 25 cards in the basic version of the game.&#10;-Each player shuffles their half decks&#10;-Each player puts their decks to the left as their &quot;draw pile.&quot;&#10;-Each player draws 5 cards.&#10;-At the same time, each player plays a fighter card in the play area between them.  A fighter card will have a symbol of a circle, square, ex, or star on it.&#10;-To determine who wins, Square beats Circle, Circle beats Ex, Ex beats Square, Star beats all.&#10;-If both players play the same cards (ex:  circle vs. circle) then &quot;war&quot; is initiated and each player draws 3 cards from the draw pile and places it face down into the play area, and then plays another fighter card for the win. War continues until someone wins.  Each time the same cards are played, war is initiated again.&#10;-The winner of each round gets all the cards in the play area and puts them into their &quot;discard pile&quot; to their right.&#10;-When the cards in the play area are the same, players must draw the 3 cards and lay them face down followed by another fighter card.  However, when the cards are different (ex:  circle vs. square) a player can then decide if they want to use an &quot;attack&quot; card, &quot;block&quot; card, or a &quot;truce&quot; card.&#10;-An &quot;attack&quot; card is basically a &quot;+1&quot; or &quot;one up&quot; to the other player for the win.&#10;-A &quot;truce&quot; card means you do not want to fight anymore and want your card back, so both players get their cards back.&#10;-A player can choose to &quot;block&quot; an &quot;attack&quot; card as a defense to try and win the round.  A &quot;truce&quot; card cannot be blocked in the basic version of the game.&#10;-After each round, each player draws back up to 5 cards for the next round.&#10;-Each player can use their full hand in each round as needed, but can only use one fighter card during a round, unless  &quot;war&quot; has been initiated and the three face down cards need to be drawn.&#10;-It takes one attack and one circle to beat a square, one attack and one square to beat an ex, and one attack and an ex to beat a  circle card.&#10;-If a star card is thrown, it takes two unblocked attacks plus any fighter card (square, circle, ex) to beat the star card&#10;-The objective of the game, or how to win, is to collect all the leader cards from the other player.&#10;-On a 5 card hand, if a player does not have any fighter cards, they must show the other player their hand to prove they are not cheating, hand over one of their cards, shuffle all their cards, and draw a new 5 card hand.&#10;-During war, if a player does not have a fighter card to finish the round, that player must count the number of cards in their hand, shuffle all their cards, and draw another hand with that number of cards.&#10;&#10;Game Play #2 - (War Strategies):&#10;-During this game style, players can choose to use attack, defense, and truce cards in order raise the stakes before going to war and/or to cancel out the war.  So, when players use the same cards (Ex:  circle vs. circle), the attack, block, and truce cards can now be played.&#10;&#10;Game Play #3 - (Aggressive Vs. Defensive):&#10;-In this style of play, one person gets all the attack cards to start with, while the other gets all the blocks and truce cards.&#10;-As an additional rule, one of the players can get the &quot;power&quot; card as well.&#10;-The &quot;power&quot; card acts as 2 attack cards.  When used as an attack card, if a player wins the round, the other player's fighter card is taken out of the game until it is over, making the game go even faster.  Star Leader cards cannot be taken out of the game since they are needed in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;Game Play #4 - (Power Cards):&#10;-In this mode, the loser of the previous round gets to use the power card to help &quot;even the odds.&quot;&#10;-One power card comes in each box.&#10;&#10;Game Play #5 - (Custom Deck Options):&#10;-In this option, players can play half decks, full decks, or customs decks, and build their own decks to battle with.&#10;-Players can choose if the cards are deck specific as well.  For example, if one person uses ninjas and the other uses pirates, the you can assume that pirates do not know how to throw ninja attack darts or stricken, and therefore the cards are no good to pirates and only the ninja cards the player acquires can use those attacks.  This option is a bit advanced so most players who play this tend to put the other players fighter cards to the side and use the attacks, blocks, truce, and power cards in a non-deck specific mode.&#10;&#10;Extra Game Information:&#10;-This game is very open so players who are comfortable with the rules tend to master it and then make up their own rules for added fun.&#10;-All decks play the same, but have different artwork to cater to everyones passions.&#10;-This game can also be used to play &quot;matching games,&quot; where you lay cards face down and try to pair them up.&#10;&#10;"

This pentomino will be his &lsquo;harvester&rsquo;, and the only piece he will use during the game.&#10;&#10;The player that chose a shape in first place draws two coins in any empty cells of the grid.&#10;&#10;Then, starting with the second player, players take turns doing the following:&#10;&#10;1. Draw your harvester on the board, so it doesn&rsquo;t overlap other previously drawn pentominos and no parts of it land outside the board. You can (and should) draw it so it overlaps some coins. Notice that you can draw it rotated or symmetrized, as long as it fits with the grid.&#10;2. Score as many coins as the pentomino has covered&#10;3. Draw another 2 coins in any two empty spaces (not occupied by coins or pentominoes).&#10;4. Pass your turn to the next player.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;re not capable of legally drawing a pentomino (no room for it) you must pass your turn. If all players pass in succesion the game ends. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;As a variant, before the game starts players can agree on the number of coins drawn each turn.&#10;&#10;"

Ten battle and 15 operational scenarios depict the major actions of the campaign, along with a number of hypothetical situations that examine possible British intervention in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935-1936, as well as the use of ships on both sides not historically available but which with better preparation in the 1930&rsquo;s or even on the eve of war could have been present.&#10;&#10;Horn of Africa is a complete boxed game in the Second World War at Sea series.

Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: Ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion.

If she hits and is dealt a card that doesn't match a card she already has in front of her, then the next player clockwise becomes the active player; if the card does match, then the round ends, she keeps one of these matching cards as penalty points, then everyone else discards their cards and a new round begins with each player being dealt a card.&#10;&#10;If the active player forfeits, the round ends and she takes the lowest-valued card visible on the table as penalty points, then a new round begins. Penalty cards remain set aside, even if the deck is shuffled to continue play. If a player acquires more penalty points than the predetermined threshold, then the game ends and this player loses. (Alternatively, players can use coins to track scores between games, with the loser paying everyone one coin, paying her score in coins to the player with the lowest score, etc.)&#10;&#10;There are many versions of Pairs from Cheapass Games. The base game play is identical, but the artwork (and artist) vary across the versions. Some include special game rules relevant to the theme of the deck. In general, you can find new/experimental/user-submitted rules at the Cheapass website, and many non-English versions of Pairs also include rules for additional games to play with this deck.&#10;&#10;"

The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition features all new artwork, a great new design, totally rewritten and more comprehensive rules, and an even better moderator scorepad. What's more, it supports more players than ever: 75 of your closest friends can converge on one or more villages using the components in this box.&#10;&#10;"

Players are participating in this deadly game to acquire as many crystals as they can. Choose from an assortment of highly illegal firearms and blast away until you're either the last player alive or you possess all the crystals!&#10;&#10;Each player starts with two primary shields (blue gems) and three crystals (the currency of the game). If a player runs out of crystals they have lost the game. A primary shield can absorb one blast from one of these lethal firearms, if a player gets hit with just one of these weapons unshielded, they will get disintegrated, and lose the game. The weapon cards contain all the information needed to use them.&#10;&#10;Each weapon, in addition to the illustration and weapon name, have a number of features,&#10;-Kill-o-watt rating: the power rating of the weapon, if both players are targeting each other, the higher kill-o-watt weapon wins and damages their target.&#10;-Deflector shield rating: some weapons have a built-in deflector shield. It can deflect a shot coming from a player that you are not targeting this round. If the kill-o-watt rating is less than or equal to the deflector shield rating (remember to multiply the deflector rating by 1,000 before comparing) the shot has no effect. Otherwise the shot goes through and can be absorbed by a primary shield or disintegrate the player.&#10;-Special ability: each weapon has a unique special ability. Some of these can be particularly game-changing and devastating. Any player may negate the special ability of a weapon at the cost of one crystal (thrown into the pot for the current round), once per round, immediately after the effect would have taken place.&#10;&#10;A round of Ray Gun Roulette has a number of phases,&#10;-Choose weapons, dealer deals each player 3 cards, they choose one and discard the rest.&#10;-Ante up!, each player places a crystal in the pot.&#10;-Aim, players pick a target, making a &quot;gun&quot; hand pointing at them. This stage is when the bluffing really takes place, feel free to switch targets, intimidate, trash talk, and fold at any time.&#10;-Last chance, Dealer declares &quot;Last chance to fold, targets locked!&quot;. From this point on players cannot switch targets. Players may not fold once this phase has ended.&#10;Fire!, all together players call out &quot;3, 2, 1, FIRE!&quot; and flip over their cards, revealing what weapons they were using.&#10;-Determine winners, Determining the winner is simple; if you lost a primary shield this round or were disintegrated, you lost. Otherwise the player has won and will split the pot with the other winners. crystals that cannot be split evenly between the winners remain in the pot for the next round.&#10;-Play continues until either one player has all the crystals or is the only one alive.&#10;&#10;"
