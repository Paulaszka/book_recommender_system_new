Using deduction to work out how best to advance their plans, the team must assemble an army of soldiers to challenge the Red Queen.&#10;&#10;In The Red Queen, the player cards are facing outwards in such a manner that all players except the one holding them will know what they are. Each round players will be able to give clues to one another to lift part of the mystery surrounding the pool of cards they collectively possess, build their army, or use special roles actions to help them in this endeavour.&#10;&#10;... meanwhile the evil Red Queen will continually interfere with the team using a set of treacherous actions in the hope to make them lose 'heart', literraly, the currency representing the team's morale in the game. Her own army will also grow throughout the game, putting the team under pressure to raise their own as efficiently as possible.&#10;&#10;The game features a strong thematic element and role cards based on characters directly inspired by Lewis Caroll's work. Alice herself takes on a key role too, unsurprisingly, but as an outsider will be of equal support to both sides and it is up to the players to make the most of her abilities.&#10;&#10;"

Twelve empires, twelve powerful gods &mdash; all longing for the same thing: limitless might.&#10;&#10;Everything started with a Cataclysm and the appearance of the New Ones, who ruthlessly squelched the Old Ones &mdash; except for those who escaped into other planes of existence, specifically four parts of the world that managed to survive the catastrophe: the Big Continent, also known as Askalar where most of the empires lay; to the North, Iceland, the Isle of the Mages; in the south, Fireland, the home of Demons; and in Oceania, Bale, the Life Tree's territory.&#10;&#10;The fight has not ended after the New Ones victory. The balance of forces varies, and it takes only a little to break the fragile balance. Fellowships are made, then breached in moments, but the stakes are much bigger than the power over Rawen. The New Ones fight not just for victory; they are seeking themselves. A secret part of their essence, which they can hardly remember. They were born on another world, which they gave up in exchange for survival. In the depths of their minds, a name pulsates about which neither their new dependents nor The Old Ones might know: Earth. The War of the Gods started in the far past of Rawen, but it affects the future of the whole universe.&#10;&#10;In the Rawen Trading Card Game, the Gods of Rawen wield their power through their Warlords. As they expand their territories, the armies of the opposing Gods frequently battle one another. Your goal is to defeat the enemy warlord with the help of fighting units, heroes, and summoned spells. Successful attacks by your army weaken your enemies, and thus weaken their God, too. If the enemy warlord ever has as many wounds as health points, the warlord dies and you win the battle.&#10;&#10;In game terms, each player chooses a warlord and a class, then creates a deck of at least 45 cards, with the warlord card, class card and primeval energy cards not counting toward this total.

The rules for that game including how the board works can be found at the following link on Chess Variants:&#10;&#10;http://www.chessvariants.org/3d.dir/startrek.html&#10;&#10;Play begins with black pieces on all dark squares of the lowest fixed board and similarly on the two movable boards which start adjacent to it. To move a movable board, it must be empty at the time but with that proviso one can on a turn either move a movable exactly as in 3-D chess (explained below for clarity) or move a piece. The rules are exactly as in standard draughts (checkers) otherwise.&#10;&#10;A big difference is that the movable board which start with white pieces begin BELOW, not above, the upper fixed board and movable boards start away from the player.&#10;&#10;How the board works:&#10;3 checkered 4x4 boards with a white square on the near right corner for either player are in fixed positions at levels 2, 4 and 6. The lateral edges are aligned but the three fixed boards are staggered so that the nearer two rows of the middle fixed board (at level 4) exactly overlap the farther two rows of the fixed board nearer to either player. The fixed board on which the black player has pieces starting is at level 2 and thus lower than the middle board. Similarly the fixed board on which white pieces start are at level 6 and thus above the middle fixed board.&#10;&#10;4 movable checkered 2x2 boards with a white space in the nearer right corner are also included. Two of these boards start at level 3 with one corner each overlapping either of the two corners of the fixed board at level 2 farther away from the black player so that the other 3 spaces of the movable boards are not over that same fixed board; these two movable boards start filled with black pieces. Similarly 2 movable board start at level 5 filled with white pieces, and these board start with one corner overlapping either of the two corners of the fixed board at level 6 farther away from the white player. The other three squares are not under that same fixed board.&#10;&#10;Levels 1 and 7 start empty. A variant of the game makes all the board fixed in their initial positions. When movement of movable board is allowed, an empty movable board can be moved up or down 2 levels (but not above level 7 or below level 1) in which case it switches between above or below the same corner of a given fixed board. Without changing level, the movable board can be moved to a position above or below the other corner along the same edge of a fixed board as it already occupies. So a movable board at level 7 above the back right corner of the fixed board at level 6 can if empty be moved to above the back left or front right corner of the board at level 6, assuming of course no other movable board is already there.&#10;&#10;Spaces directly above or below each other will have the same color.&#10;&#10;Pieces' moves general conventional draughts moves to 3-D as follows. One looks at the board from above and flattens it. If the piece could move onto a space in this flattened version of the board, it can move onto it so long as a piece does not skip a level. Namely, in a non-capturing move, one cannot move directly from level 4 to level 6 and one can only do so in a capturing move if jumping a piece on a board at level 5.&#10;&#10;What playing is like:&#10;It sounds harder than it is but does take some getting used to. The board geometry makes things interesting.&#10;&#10;"

The player controls the Irish forces fighting the British, then, after the treaty with Britain, plays the role of Michael Collins' Free State forces against the anti-treaty Republicans.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    Map&#10;    Rules&#10;    British counters (Army, RIC, Black &amp; Tans, UVF)&#10;    Irish Free State counters (Mob, Guerillas, Regulars, A/Car, Artillery)&#10;    Irish Republican counters (Mob, Guerillas, Flying column)&#10;    D6 is required&#10;&#10;&#10;Playing time = 30-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Game play: &#10;As the Irish player, you must first force the British to end the war in a treaty. This is done by denying areas of the country to them and eliminating British units. After this is completed, the Irish forces split along the line of the civil war. As the Free State (pro-treaty) player you will likely be initially outnumbered by the Republicans (anti-treaty), but with superior organisation and tactics, you can force their surrender.&#10;&#10;Historical background and the game: There are very few games on either the Irish war of independence, or the subsequent civil war. The war of independence can be indirectly blamed on the Germans. In 1912, after years (centuries, some would say) of resistance, the British parliament passed the Irish Home Rule bill. The bill then began to grind its way through parliament to become law. This was widely approved in Ireland, apart from the North-east, where the largely Protestant population feared for their future in what would be a largely Catholic state. They started to arm themselves as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and so did their Irish nationalist adversaries. Civil war looked likely, but was happily averted by the sudden arrival of several million heavily armed Germans in Belgium and France. Both the UVF and the Nationalists then happily joined the British army to fight the common foe. Meanwhile, the home rule bill was suspended for the war's duration, but sure it would all be over by Christmas... wouldn't it?&#10;&#10;It wasn't, and by 1916 some more radical Nationalists (called Republicans) got fed up and in Easter staged a farcical uprising, limited to those units that didn't get the message that it had been called off. It was crushed, but the hanging of the leaders, and the increasing harshness of British measures as the war progressed caused a sea-change in public opinion. In the 1918 general election, almost all of Ireland (not the North-east) voted in the Sinn Fein party, which refused to sit in the British parliament and, in 1919 declared Irish independence. Desultory fighting started between the new Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces. This is the point at which the game starts, with IRA units of varying capability in most areas of Ireland, and British garrisons (mostly Royal Irish Constabulary) throughout. In 1920 the home rule bill (remember it) passed, but by now with a special amendment allowing two parliaments - one for the North-east (now called Northern Ireland) and one for the rest of Ireland. Sinn Fein ignored it, as they already considered themselves independent, while Northern Ireland voted itself into existence. The game shows this effect with Northern Ireland having extra military units of the UVF.&#10;&#10;As the war progressed, the IRA were most successful in the Southern parts of Ireland, and the British forces were gradually excluded from the countryside and limited to towns. The game simulates this by giving different units different strength depending on the terrain - IRA guerillas and Flying columns are best in the countryside, the British better in the urban areas.&#10;&#10;With neither side able to win, and the British half expecting the home rule bill to have solved things in the first place, a peace treaty was signed. The treaty gave Southern Ireland (now called the Free State) Dominion status (like in Australia or Canada), with the King still as head of state, and cemented the separation of Northern Ireland. Naturally, this disgusted the more radical elements of Sinn Fein (led by Eamon De Valera), and military units who considered that they had won and so should have full independence. An election in 1922 was won handily by the pro-treaty Sinn Fein, but this did not solve things and fighting started as the pro-treaty forces, under Michael Collins, started to assert themselves over the anti-treaty forces. At this point, the players forces are split - largely along historical lines, with the South containing more anti-treaty forces, and the East more pro-treaty forces. As the player, you control the Free State forces against the anti-treaty republicans. This also means that you need to be careful how you fight the British since you will be raising troops that may not be loyal to the Free State!&#10;&#10;Initially outnumbered, the Free State forces rapidly mobilised and quite quickly crushed the Republicans. They used innovative tactics, notably landing troops by ship at key points behind enemy lines, and were able to win battles because they generally had artillery and armour (armoured cars) while the republicans didn't. In the game you can perform naval landings, and you have attached artillery and armoured car units to give a bonus in combat.&#10;&#10;Victory is decided by two things - How quickly the British are beaten, and how quickly/completely the Republicans are beaten.&#10;&#10;"

In this game it's a bad move when a gang member escapes, because it weakens the gang left inside!&#10;&#10;Players compete to gain territory across the prison map.  Winners place their cards in one of the vacant cells in the block.  The block makes a decision by a majority vote about who is to be The GUV&quot;NOR.  Unless one player has more than half the cells deals need to be done between players. Players then move along the track (called the perimeter wall) and where they land decides what actions take place.  Actions can change the number of cards in the block, place or remove trouble cards on the prison map, or require the block to make decisions.  Decisions will be determined by both the cards in the block at the time and the relationship  between the players.&#10;&#10;This game enables all members of the family to play as it provides lots of times when &quot;I win you lose&quot; scenarios to arise.&#10;&#10;Simple rules means they are easily mastered and that enables more sophisticated game play as players try to use the rules to get ahead.&#10;&#10;Further rules including challenging the leadership of the GUV'NOR - making  regular decisions about who to back and what parole points to deal with  and lockdown - which gives the current GUV'NOR power to make the decisions the block did, including being ale to win a leadership challenge whatever the number of cards in the block raise tension as players try to find away to either stay in control or wrestle it away from others without the wrong rivals taking control.&#10;&#10;If no one player dominates the Block then deals have to be done between players to form packs. But trust no one. Each turn players roll a dice and move around the board along the perimiter wall as they serve their sentence and have to make decisions about who they support. Decisions are determined by the number of gang member cards they have in The Block. Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence. Players have to manoeuvre themselves through their sentence until one player has gained 20 parole points. Points are lost or gained by getting caught by the staff, taking control of the Block, time served and from doing deals with other players to get their support.&#10;&#10;This leads to a fast paced game, players are constantly changing sides, working out who best to support, and not getting caught by the staff. Watch as the  staff increase security, send you to solitary and threatens lockdown!   It is an exhausting game of wit, strategy, coercion and survival that brings out the best and the worst in participants! In the end you don't just win you probably get rehabilitated!&#10;&#10;The rules are designed to be interdependent, hence the block makes decisions that effect the level of security.  At both extremes, ie too high or too low the scale has a trouble space.  If the scale is on trouble and all of the trouble cards are placed on the map then trouble starts.  this is a spontaneous battle for territory that lasts 4 turns and enables a potentially dramatic change in who runs the block.  This rule, like many others provides an exciting tension where players can predict what could happen next (within the dice roll) to change who is winning or what opportunities were lost to defeat who is currently in charge.&#10;&#10;The game is very visual, so it matters where the players pieces are along the perimeter wall, how many cards are held in the block, what bonus cards are in solitary, whether the prison is in lockdown or not, and how many trouble cards there are on the map.&#10;&#10;"

In addition, after comparing the production of all players, whoever has used the most of each resource type is fined for pollution. To make things interesting, you have the option of turning your production cards face down, so that they won't be counted as pollution.

Lovecraft story of the same name &ndash; that is, they don't know whether or not rats truly scamper behind the walls of their residence.&#10;&#10;In the game, one player is the Giver and starts the round with the dice cup and a single die, which shows one rat on one face, two rats on another face, and no rats on the remaining four faces. The Giver places the die in the cup, shakes the cup, places it face down, then peeks inside. He then claims to hear no rats behind the walls or some number of rats. If he says no rats and the next player &ndash; the Receiver &ndash; believes him, the Receiver becomes the new Giver, adds a die to the cup, and the game continues; if the Receiver doesn't believe him, then he lifts the cup. If no rats are present, the Receiver loses one &quot;brain&quot; scoring token to the Giver; clearly he's touched in the head if he's hearing rats where none exist. If rats are present, however, then the Giver loses two brains, giving one of them to the Receiver. The Caller's an even worse case!&#10;&#10;If the Giver claims that rats are present, he must pay one brain, then the Receiver taking the cup can call him (with penalties going one way or the other) or he can believe the Giver, handing over one brain to the Giver as the sanity cost of accepting such nonsense. The Receiver can then either pass the cup along to the next person or he can add a die to the cup, shake all the dice, and make another claim about the number of mice in the walls, with this number being at least one larger than the previous number. In this case, the Receiver becomes the Giver, and the round continues as before.&#10;&#10;Once one player has lost all of his brains, the game ends, and the player with the most brains wins.&#10;&#10;"

This is Alteil: Horizons, the all new sequel to one of Japan&rsquo;s most popular online card games, soon to be ready for fantasy, tactical combat, card game, and anime enthusiasts worldwide.&#10;&#10;Four Gods Sleep Under Lavato&hellip;&#10;&#10;Harness Their Power!&#10;&#10;You are an Iczer, a summoner and master strategist tasked with protecting the world of Lavato from the forces of Batora, the embodiment of evil accross all dimensions. An ancient struggle between Batora and the four Old Gods of Lavato drained the Gods of power, sinking them into a sleep that has lasted thousands of years. But the Gods still influence Lavato from the depths of slumber&hellip;&#10;&#10;One night, a new Prince is born, and the sun suddenly rises. Night becomes day, and a miracle is proclaimed. The Church of the True God takes advantage of the miracle to orchestrate the installation of the Solar Prince to the throne - and the ensuing power struggle plunges Lavato into war.&#10;&#10;With the violence, tragedy, and death of the war, Batora&rsquo;s hunger for evil and chaos is stoked - and he&rsquo;s set his sights on Lavato again! But with the Old Gods deep in slumber, who will protect Lavato from Batora&rsquo;s endless rage?&#10;&#10;Now is the time of the Iczers. They&rsquo;ve studied the legends of Lavato&rsquo;s Old Gods. They&rsquo;ve learned to command the Gods&rsquo; powerful Four Spheres of Influence. They&rsquo;ve mastered the art of using these Spheres to summon heroes, monsters, and dragons to battle the forces of chaos and evil. Will you be the brave Iczer who saves Lavato from destruction?&#10;&#10;As in any collectible card game, a game of Alteil: Horizons begins with carefully crafting a deck. There&rsquo;s a universe of over 1,000 cards to choose from, each representing the factions, heroes, villains, monsters and magic of Lavato&rsquo;s past and present. Your collection begins with any of four free 30-card starter decks, themed around the four Spheres.&#10;&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve challenged another Iczer to a duel, use your resources wisely to play your cards. Spell cards represent your command of the Spheres; unit cards represent your ability to summon heroes and monsters. Each unit is a fully fleshed-out combatant, complete with hit points, attack and defense power, agility, and range. Combat takes place on a battle grid - maneuver your units so that their unique abilities fit your winning strategy. And their abilities really are unique! A fighter with two swords might be able to hit two enemies at once; a mage can tap into your resources to play spells that wreak havoc on the entire battlefield! You have complete control of each unit&rsquo;s abilities during combat.&#10;&#10;A number of features set Alteil apart from the other online card games out there. For example...&#10;&#10;Range based grid: position archers behind your front-line fighters to launch a ranged attack. Position your mages in the rear to protect them as they cast powerful defensive and offensive spells.&#10;&#10;Resource recycling: when a card dies, you get back the resources you spent on it. Two small soldiers die? Use the Spell Points they originally cost to bring out something big and scary.&#10;&#10;Revival system: if a unit dies you can spend a copy of it from your deck to revive it on the battlefield. Keep your best soldiers alive to execute killer multi-unit combos!&#10;&#10;Soul Cards: influence the pace of the game by choosing your starting Life Points and Soul Skills. Give yourself stronger Soul Skills and less Life for a more offense-based approach, or give yourself more Life Points to buy time for a crafty strategy.&#10;&#10;Day/Night cycle: as duels rage on, the sun rises and sets. Units like the Undead and Werewolves are stronger at night - while a holy warrior gets bonuses under the first rays of morning - so summon them when they&rsquo;ll be most effective!&#10;&#10;Alteil has over two thousand individual pieces of art completed already. It&rsquo;s got the visual style and story of a Japanese RPG. It&rsquo;s got unique game mechanics. We hope you&rsquo;ll become a huge fan. We already are. This is Alteil: Horizons.&#10;&#10;"

Most of them are tourists without the experience or skills needed to climb an eight-thousander. Without proper help they wouldn't make it to the Himalayas, let alone brave the mighty Chomolungma.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, that's where you come in, an experienced mountaineer and mountain guide. You've got Broad Peak, K2 and other eight-thousanders under your belt, and you've climbed Mount Everest several times. This time you face a far greater challenge: You must lead a bunch of tourists to the peak and safely get them back to base. You gaze at the mountain and you know this to be true &ndash; what is child's play for you might be the last adventure of your clients.&#10;&#10;You must plan where to set up camp and how to deal with acclimatization, who to take up to the peak and when, and who to lead down the mountain. When you look at your clients' enthusiastic faces, you know that their lives are in your hands.&#10;&#10;In Mount Everest players take control of a team of two expert mountaineers who must lead as many tourists as they can to the peak and, of course, safely bring them back. Each player gets an identical deck of cards that are used for moving around the board. Players must decide where to set up camps and how much oxygen to bring to the top; only oxygen lets players get acclimatization cards, which allow tourists to survive the climb. Players must also decide what type of customers they want: the athletic, fairly competent climbers, or the wealthier and more prestigious amateurs. Climbing with one tourist in tow is easy, but the key to victory lies in guiding whole groups. Unfortunately, the more people you take with you, the higher the likelihood is of something going wrong. Also, as it is in the mountains, the weather will be a crucial factor. If a player can coordinate an expedition that avoids a crisis at the peak, he should be able to lead the happy tourists back to base.&#10;&#10;Who will become the best Himalayan guide?&#10;&#10;"
