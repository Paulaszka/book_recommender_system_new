It is the middle of the 16th Century and young, ambitious noble families are reclaiming the dry hinterlands, building fields, forests, and lakes around their castles. Piece by piece - parcel by parcel - their holdings increase. Farmers work the fields, and in especially successful areas, monks found their influential cloisters. But everything happens under the watchful eyes of the nobility. Intrigues are hatched, tax collectors fleece the landowners, and far too often entire tracts of land are lost to locust plagues. Only he who keeps a cool head will become the Duke of Salamanca.&#10;&#10;Through clever use of cards in hand, players obtain tiles for placement (buildings, landscapes, privileges) as well as the ability to carry out certain actions. The tiles obtained are placed on tactically important spaces on the game board. Players can also place ownership markers onto buildings. By cleverly placing landscape tiles adjacent to the proper buildings, valuable regions can be formed that will bring in doubloons. Through the actions that can be gained by playing cards, players can bring plague stones (among other things) onto the board, and thereby block their opponents' tiles. The winner is the player with the most doubloons at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"

Army lists are provided for Philippian/Alexandran Macedonian; Late Achaemenid Persian; Roman Marian/Caesarian; Celtic/Gallic Barbarian; Norman Conquest; and Late Saxon armies.&#10;&#10;Turn sequence is determined through an initiative system.  Armor and Shield protection is key to defining defensive capabilities.  Multiple categories of mounted, infantry and missile troops are distinguished.  Leadership is represented through several tiers of Leaders.&#10;&#10;The system is primarily geared for 25/28mm figures.  Conversion instructions are included for 15mm and 40mm armies.  Armies usually compose from 100 to 300 figures per side; the standard system figure ratio is 1?40.&#10;&#10;Army statistics, including General characteristics, War Machine attributes and Army List Templates are recorded on copies of forms provided with the rules.  Referral to these lists suffice for determining combat and morale outcomes in a game. Games featuring armies of this size can be completed in three to four hours once the system is understood.&#10;&#10;Publisher website: www.battlestandard.com&#10;&#10;"
