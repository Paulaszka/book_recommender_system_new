Your objective is to be the most badass by the end of the game while making your friends look lame.&#10;&#10;Now how? With the playing deck, each player has a &quot;formation card&quot; to show you how your &quot;body&quot; is formed. Your body is made up of six tattooable limbs (two arms, two legs, a chest, and a back); and each limb holds enough space for 3 designs each (so 18 designs in total).&#10;&#10;To fill these limbs, you have to get tattooed. The game consists of three types of cards: Positive Tattoos (indicated by their blue title color and positive value), Negative Tattoos (indicated by their red title color and negative value, and Modifier Cards (which have no number value and have only a gold bar at the bottom of the card).&#10;&#10;Now game play is easy to learn. Each players starts with a hand size of 5 cards... which will remain for the game unless you have a card that says other wise. And you have four main actions on your turn.&#10;&#10;1. Get tattooed:&#10;This can be a positive or a negative tattoo. To get a positive tattoo, you have to discard either another positive tattoo or a modifier (which is good as gold even though it doesn't have a number value) since good tattoo artists don't work for free. To get a negative tattoo, you probably know someone working out of a van or basement that will give you tetanus along with a free tattoo, so negative tattoos are free and don't require a discard payment. Some cards, both positive and negative, have extra effects that are in their description bars under their titles.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Note if you can't or choose not to do either, you can discard two cards to pass. But to get to your second action, you have to get a tattoo on yourself first.&#10;&#10;&#10;2. Open play:&#10;This is where you can do as much as your hand allows. If you can pay for a second tattoo, you can get one. This is also where the use of modifiers come into play and where the pvp aspect comes in. There is a dreaded modifier known as &quot;Bad Advice&quot;. This modifier is what mainly allows a player to play negative tattoos on other players. And there are other great modifiers that also will effect tattoos that are already in play.&#10;&#10;3. Is a require discard.&#10;This allows for a more balance deck as well as forces more strategy and less hording. There are cards that will effect the discard.&#10;&#10;4. Is basically refresh. Fill your hand back to five (unless you have a card that says other wise).&#10;&#10;The end game is determined when one player has filled their body, that player receives 5 bonus points, and everyone then totals their tattoo values to determine the winner. So just because you finished first, it doesn't mean you've won.&#10;&#10;"

Whether it&rsquo;s a simple point-to-point rally-style race, capture the flag or a quest to uncover hidden secrets each game is filled with unexpected events, lots of player interaction, ever-changing boards and a dash of mayhem.&#10;&#10;The core mechanism in Quodd Heroes is something you&rsquo;ve never seen before. Each player controls a different cube-shaped character miniature and player board.  You then assign a different movement skill to five of the six sides of your character (the sixth side has an ability unique to your character). When you begin the movement phase on your turn you &ldquo;tumble&rdquo; your character into an adjacent space and perform the movement skill associated with the face-up side of your character. Skills include: Tumble, Jump, Slide, Diagonal Slide, and Dash.&#10;&#10;While you work to complete the scenario&rsquo;s objective(s), either on your own, cooperatively, or against other players, game boards which are laid out in grids present obstacles like walls, raging rivers, chasms, moving platforms, rotating board sections, trap doors, tunnels, teleporters and more. As you navigate the world you create new obstacles and shortcuts while battling your opponents by pushing them into pits, blocking their paths and fouling their plans.&#10;&#10;As you explore the world you will find food, runes, items and pets in the form of cards. These cards enhance your abilities, slow your opponents and modify the world around you. If you use your movement skills and cards strategically you'll emerge as the greatest of the Quodd Heroes.&#10;&#10;Player Turn Structure:&#10;&#10;1. Play cards (power up): Play as many cards as you like from your hand. Power up and alter the board prior to movement.&#10;&#10;2. Movement Phase: Perform your natural tumble by turning your hero miniature over into an adjacent space, activate any board elements on that space, then activate the movement skill associated with the side of your character that is now facing up. Move up to your maximum distance with that skill in any direction you like.&#10;&#10;3. Play card (recover phase): You many play any additional cards you like during this phase.&#10;&#10;4. Exploration phase: draw cards from the lineup of cards or the top of the deck equal to your exploration value&#10;&#10;At the end of each round an upkeep phase includes:&#10;&#10;- moving board elements and animals&#10;- play a world event card that effects all players&#10;- Adjust round tracker (in timed scenarios)&#10;- all heroes upgrade their hero by selecting an upgrade tile and placing it in their upgrade track.&#10;- First player mark passes to the left&#10;&#10;"

Each player ends their turn by drawing the top card for the creature deck. The deck has been shuffled and contains six cards of each monster and four identical &ldquo;full moon&rdquo; cards. When the full moon is drawn, the next three creature cards are drawn before the next player takes their turn.&#10;If one creature emerges on a location you occupy, you capture a picture token when you successfully leave that location.

A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. They're called Epics. But, every Epic turned out to be evil. Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named Steelheart reigns supreme!&#10;&#10;Nobody fights back... nobody but the Reckoners! This is where you come in. You are a member of the Reckoners, a skilled group of normal humans who assassinate Epics. Your mission is simple, but not easy. Take down Steelheart and his Epics and save the city.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The Reckoners is a simultaneous, co-operative game for 1-6 players that plays in 75 minutes. You win by defeating Steelheart. But before you can defeat him, you must first discover his weakness. Throughout the game, you will work with your fellow Reckoners to research and attack Steelheart, but he is not alone. Numerous Epics are scattered throughout the city, and they will wreak havoc upon the population, if left unchecked. If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then all Reckoners lose.&#10;&#10;The Reckoners determine which actions to take primarily through a simultaneous, dice rolling mechanism, where each player can keep and reroll results up to three times at their own pace. Equipment Cards and Plan Tokens will also allow you to gain extra actions or improve/manipulate the results of your dice. Actions are resolved simultaneously as well, so communication and collaborative planning are key to ensuring optimal outcomes.&#10;&#10;Your dice can be used to attack Epics, research Epics, contain Epics, attack Enforcement, earn money, acquire Plan Tokens, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers. Researching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness. But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely. When all actions have been taken by The Reckoners, then it's the Epics turn.&#10;&#10;Each round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round. Each Epic also has a unique set of actions it performs, so you're always facing multiple threats that function very differently. The crux of the game is deciding how to resolve these competing threats and prioritize your actions together to eliminate Epics and ultimately win the game. How, when, and where you act will determine your victory or failure.&#10;&#10;Summary:&#10;In short, The Reckoners plays like a challenging, ever-shifting puzzle. If you like co-operative games where you carefully manage resources, build powerful action combos, create tactical plans with your teammates, and work together to take down the bad guy while on the brink of defeat, then be sure to check out The Reckoners.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

In this case, the captain may not go down with the ship, but you can bet everyone else will!&#10;&#10;Mutiny was introduced in concept during the 2014 rpggeek.com VirtuaCon digital convention event. At that time it was called &quot;Pirates of the Sinking Ship&quot;.&#10;&#10;The rules for Mutiny are simple: Using five, or perhaps six, standard dice, players roll for values of 3-5, hoping to amass wealth, 6's to board the lifeboat on which the gold is stored, while attempting to avoid 1's and 2's, which sink the ship.&#10;&#10;When the ship reaches a water level of 20 fathoms, the ship sinks, with all aboard except whichever clever pirate has snuck aboard the lifeboat and made away with the treasure.&#10;&#10;This game also includes Rum cards, which can be spent to gain initiative to roll dice. However, when a player's number is rolled, his rum card must be spent. Therefore, all players will receive an opportunity to roll the dice (and hopefully board the lifeboat) at least once.&#10;&#10;Mutiny is played over a course of 3 separate games. Player character abilities shift each game, and are related to numbers also used to initiate a player's turn.&#10;&#10;1) When this player is aboard the lifeboat, 1's rolled increase the water level by 2 fathoms.&#10;&#10;2) This player may reroll any 2's rolled during his turn.&#10;&#10;3) This player may keep his Rum card until he chooses to spend it to take his turn.&#10;&#10;4) This player adds 2 gold to the lifeboat whenever he rolls a 4.&#10;&#10;5) This player acquires 1 gold for his own personal pocket whenever anyone rolls his number during turn initiation. (The gold is added to his score at game end, provided he has won at least one of the three games.)&#10;&#10;6) This player rolls six dice, instead of 5.&#10;&#10;May the best backstabbing mutineer win!&#10;&#10;"

It simulated the desperate skirmishes, firefights and encounters taking place in the last 120 days of humanity. The players took the role of powermongers, leaders and warlords of what armed forces still existing in the postapocalyptic wasteland, using remaining survivors as tools to enforce their agenda.&#10;&#10;It was stated Apokalypse used 25mm miniatures but since that scale later came to be known as (non-heroic) 28mm you could generally say that 28mm is the default standard for the game. The length measure unit, &quot;meters&quot;, was intentionally meant for being adapted to whatever scale of minis you had access to, making the game playable with all scales of miniatures.&#10;&#10;When Hardcore Media was liquidated, around 1998-99, the game faded into obscurity and very much stayed that way.&#10;In 2016 it was made available online, as a freeware document with the creators' consent, through a fan-made PDF of the original rulebook (available in the Web Links section).&#10;&#10;There were occasional references to expansions throughout the core rulebook. The material for all of these was sadly destroyed when Hardcore Media folded and its creators moved on to different projects.

The cards are unique in several aspects. You can scratch them like lottery tickets, but by doing so you are not destroying or devaluing them. Each hero card is unique; each hero has a unique name and value generated. No one else in the world will have the same card! Slowly uncover the card by scratching it and in combination with unique values, it is pleasantly thrilling. Cards can even be bought individually. (Would you rather have a hero or a weapon?)&#10;&#10;With an increasing number of weapon cards, you can try a sophisticated one-on-one duel in which you equip your hero with up to five weapons, then think strategically to find out which one to use when. The duel itself is very interesting; you spin a special circular weapon: turntable paper on a stick. The hero has certain levels of energy which you spend using various weapons. Heroes can change weapons during the turn and their proper use is the focus of the game. The game is risk management; you are trying to spend the hero's energy for the best possible effects. According to the composition of effects, you choose weapon, strategy and risk. You can attack the opponent's weapon, his permanent effects, or the hero directly. You have to decide when to repair a weapon, when to save energy for the hit with more powerful weapons, etc.&#10;&#10;Once you get into the basic game, you can try a more comprehensive and strategic mode in which teams of heroes compete against each other. Then you can move to the top mode where entire armies of heroes collide. With more than two players, it is possible to play in teams or each player plays by themselves with modified rules. The game is perfect for tournaments.&#10;&#10;If you want to play with just one player, simply scan the card into your phone and you can play online. There is a varied range of options at your disposal, from tournaments and hero trainings to territorial fights. The goal is to level your hero up and obtain spells for him. As the first game in the world, Scratch Wars presents digital ownership so that what you have physically, you also have digitally. If you later want to replace or sell any of your heroes, you can change them digitally with all that is recorded on the card, i.e., with all the spells and experiences.&#10;&#10;If you would rather play the game more as a board game and add more strategic options, you will be able to expand the game with &quot;trade&quot; cards or hero's &quot;abilities&quot;.&#10;&#10;"

Then they roll dice to build up the ancient ruins on the board. The taller a ruin is, the more points it is worth but the bigger target it is to be knocked down by an enemy siege engine. Dice knocked out of play are captured and worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever has the most points currently on the board wins. There are five different scoring objectives (ruin height, color matching, captured enemy dice, faction objectives, and your faction leader's control) which can all contribute to your victory.&#10;&#10;"

Fantasy themes and RPG tropes are turned on their heads in this game full of clumsy and unfortunately ill-fated heroes. Your job, as leader of your Venture Party, is to decide which characters are putting their lives on the line for the team. Discard the unlucky heroes and collect loot to build the strongest party! With the new 16 card built in expansion pack, there is even more potential for mayhem before you reach the bottom of the deck! The land is ripe with opportunity, and only one Venture Party will come out on top. Will it be yours?&#10;&#10;The game begins by dealing 2 Party Members, and 1 Loot Token to every player. At the start of each player turn, they must draw one party member and play one party member from their hand. These heroes are disposable, each with a Power Level value from 1 to 16. Every number has varying effects depending on their Power Level (gathering loot, removing player cards, look at a players hand etc.) Since a Loot Token adds +1 to your party's overall power, Loot handling can sometimes make the difference between the winning and losing parties.&#10;&#10;WINNING: When the deck runs out the game is over. You want to end the game with the strongest venture party. The strength of your party is determined by combining the numbers on your cards with the number of loot tokens you have you your possession.&#10;&#10;Ex: If Pedro has the Necromancer (Level 12) and the Blind Monk (Level 6) and 5 Loot, his score is&#10;12 + 6 + 5 =23&#10;&#10;"

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point or replace (flip) a weak enemy stone with a stone of your color. A black stone is weak if it is part of at least one of the following patterns or their translations, rotations or reflections:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Black stone on b2 and white stones on b3, a3, a2 and b1.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Black stone on b2 and white stones on a4, a3, a2, b1 and c1.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Black stone in a 2&times;2 area orthogonally adjacent to eight white stones.&#10;&#10;&#10;Likewise, with colors reversed, for weak white stones.&#10;&#10;Passing is not allowed, but, if you have no legal moves available, your turn is skipped.&#10;&#10;You win if there is a chain of orthogonally connected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. If neither player has a move available and neither player has won, Black wins if there is at least one pair of vertically adjacent, like-colored stones, and White wins otherwise.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesOn an n&times;n board, the number of deadlocks, including symmetrical copies, is 2^(n + 1) - 2, i.e. two less than four times the number of compositions of n. Note that, in a deadlock, there can be vertically adjacent, like-colored stones or horizontally adjacent, like-colored stones, but not both. If there are no adjacencies of either type because the stones form a checkered pattern, White wins.&#10;&#10;The following mutators can be applied to alter the character of the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Minimorph: The last weakness pattern is not used, and the other two have the stone in the top left corner removed from them. This requires a larger board than the standard game, as it makes blocking quite harder. On the other hand, deadlocks are impossible. All other mutators on this list work best when combined with this one.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Deepmorph: A stone that was flipped by your opponent on their latest turn still counts as a friendly stone for flipping purposes. In this case, the winning condition must be checked for a player at the start of their turn, and it is illegal to flip a stone if the opponent could flip it back on their next turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Duomorph: After placing (not flipping) a stone on your turn, you must, if possible, place a second friendly stone on an empty point orthogonally adjacent to the first one.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Remorph: When you remove an enemy stone and there are empty points on the board, place the removed stone next to the board. On their next turn, your opponent must place the stone back on an empty point of the board and then make a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Metamorph: The game starts with the board filled with stones in a checkered pattern.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
