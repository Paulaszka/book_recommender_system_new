Each mission is a 74-page book which contains the start of a story, a mission briefing (telling the player what cards may be used), and then the rest of the story.  After the mission briefing the player chooses a character card and a specified number of weapon, vehicle, and ability cards which can be used on the mission.  At many points in the story the player will be required to use a weapon, a vehicle, or an ability, to check against a skill level, and in some cases to choose one of several possible courses of action.&#10;&#10;The object is to complete all the missions without running out of mission points.  While the player in general cannot lose a confrontation, if he or she does badly mission points will be lost.  When playing on the advanced level every weapon, vehicle, and ability costs missions points for every use.&#10;&#10;The basic set includes 1 mission book, 1 mission blueprint (a diagram of locations), and 12 cards in addition to the rulebook, score pad, log book, rules summary sheet, and dice.  Supplemental missions were sold, each consisting of a mission book, mission blueprint, and additional cards.&#10;&#10;The missions are:&#10; 1 - Assault on Yavin Four (included in basic set)&#10; 2 - Escape from Thyferra&#10; 3 - Attack on Delrakin&#10; 4 - Destroy the Liquidator&#10; 5 - The Hunt for Han Solo&#10; 6 - The Search for Grubba the Hutt&#10; 7 - Ithorian Invasion&#10; 8 - Togorian Trap&#10; 9 - Revolt of the Battle Droids&#10; 10 - Showdown in Mos Eisley&#10; 11 - Bounty Hunter vs. Battle Droids&#10; 12 - The Vactooine Disaster&#10; 13 - Prisoner of the Nikto Pirates&#10; 14 - The Monsters of Dweem&#10; 15 - Voyage to the Underworld&#10; 16 - Imperial Jailbreak&#10; 17 - Darth Vader's Return&#10; 18 - Rogue Squadron to the Rescue&#10; 19 - Bounty on Bonadan&#10; 20 - Total Destruction&#10;&#10;"

If the latter, the player must correctly answer a question from a supplied card to avoid the weight gain. (The cards give both the correct answer and its rationale, to provide an educational experience for the players.)&#10;&#10;Players &quot;lose weight&quot; either by landing on the &quot;Fat Farm&quot; or by correctly answering a question when landing on the &quot;Slim Chance&quot; space.&#10;&#10;Players sent to the &quot;Pig Pen&quot; must wear a supplied Pig Mask until their next turn.&#10;&#10;"

Make sure the cutout figures are secure on the holder&mdash; Mary on one side, Bert on the other.  Place selector on space provided on playing board.&#10;&#10;To operate the selector, pick up the figure holder and let the pole slide all the way through.

One pointer will point to one of the instructions surrounding the merry-go-round, the other will indicate a different instruction.&#10;&#10;To determine order of play, each player picks a playing piece and puts it on one of the instructions around the merry-go-round.

Order of play is then clockwise from the playing piece of the first player.&#10;&#10;All players now place their playing pieces on Cherry Tree Lane ready to start.&#10;&#10;PLAY: Each player &quot;asks Mary&quot; for his instructions by using the merry-go-round selector as described earlier.

However, if a player chooses to be sent there by Mary or Bert he must miss his next two turns.  (If a player waiting in the countryside trades places with a player in front or in back of him, he is free and the traded player must wait whatever turns remain.)&#10;&#10;Winner is the first player to reach the park.&#10;&#10;"

The design is typical of this type of game, with plenty of opportunities for discussion, speculation and dramatic accusations.&#10;&#10;The second case (Death of a Train Spotter) has no speaking parts, and is therefore playable by any number of guests.

Each stand is a battalion, the ground scale is 3&quot; = 1 mile, and turns are 90-180 minutes.  The rules are designed from the ground up to play multi-day campaigns with multiple divisions per side.&#10;&#10;Like Bruce's &quot;Great Battles of World War II&quot; rules, one of the primary concepts is that of troops &quot;going to ground&quot;.  Troops start the day fresh and can make dramatic breakthroughs.  But, as damage occurs, troops are less willing to push forward, they will seek out defensive positions and wait for a new day.  Green troops, in particular, will tend to go to ground very quickly, while more elite troops can continue moving forward.  At this level, combat is abstracted, but operational aspects such as air support and corps and army artillery support are key parts of the system.&#10;&#10;A number of scenario books are available for the system, including France 1940, Eastern Front, Normandy, North Africa, and the Pacific.&#10;&#10;"

The long-standing feud between the Bourbons and Habsburgs erupted once again as both sides pressed their claim to the throne. &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; is a two-player Card-Driven wargame that elegantly recreates this epic struggle using a point-to-point map and a single deck of 55 cards. Action cards are used to activate armies for movement and siege, while event cards bring historical and special events into play that can swing the tide of fortune when least expected. Each turn represents one year, each corps represents 10,000 men of all arms and each leader represents a major commander and his staff.&#10;&#10;The game features an easy and intuitive battle system that highlights a unique aspect of this war: team-based battle command, perhaps the most famous example being the extraordinary success achieved by the partnership of two of the war&rsquo;s most prominent commanders, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Bourbon cause has talented leaders as well, notably Marshals Villars, Vendome and Berwick. These and other leaders are rated for Tactical and Command capabilities and they significantly influence the course of events.&#10;&#10;The map stresses the importance of fortresses in a war that was probably the high-point of formal siege warfare. Fortresses in this era rarely held out against a besieger that had the necessary time and manpower to conduct a proper siege, and the game neatly recreates this with a simple siege table that leaves room for unusually stout defenses or quick collapses.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained or lost by the Alliance player and game victory comes either through automatic victory or based on final VPs after the 1713 turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;&quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot; is a two player Card-Driven wargame depicting the &quot;War of the Spanish Succession&quot;. The war was fought primarily to determine the fate of the Spanish throne and its dominions but also represented a continuing struggle for political, religious and economic dominance. One player represents the interests of the French claimant, Philip V (the Bourbons), while the other player represents the interests of the Austrian claimant, Charles III (the Alliance).&#10;&#10;Each turn is one year. Each unit represents approximately 10,000 men of all arms. Leader counters represent the named personality and his staff.&#10;&#10;24 pages of rulebook including extended example of play and designer's notes.&#10;&#10;"
