Not a good thing. Operation Sherdil (Lion Heart) began in August 2008 and was initially aimed at preventing the imminent fall of Khar, headquarters of Bajaur District, to the Taliban. The military operation was intended to reclaim all of Bajaur from the Taliban and al Qaeda, which amounted to around 3000 terrorists. On August 3rd, a 200-strong force from the paramilitary Frontier Corps were surrounded by 300-400 Taliban fighters, heavy fighting erupted as they tried to break out. After a three-day battle, the Pakistani troops routed back to Khar, and the Taliban seemed victorious. They quickly followed the Pakistani force and began to threaten Khar. Operation Sherdil was later expanded to recapturing all of Bajaur district from the Taliban. This proved to be a tall order and led to a protracted series of battles over two months. Pakistan's resolve came into question (as it still does). By late October, many of the objectives had been reached but not all. Loysam was not retaken until Oct. 25th. Over 2700 terrorists had been killed, yet, Bajaur Agency remained unsettled when the army left. It remains so to this day.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;Each turn is six days, with half mile hexes. Units are battalion and company for Pakistani forces, and platoon size for al-&#10;Qaeda and Taliban. The game is a true conventional military force taking on the terrorist groups in Bajaur Agency from August through October, 2008. The terrorists were well armed and had fortified many of the small towns outside of the city of Khar. They had been slowly taking over the area. Sherdil was prompted when a small force of paramilitary found themselves surrounded and under siege at Loysam from 300 Taliban. This Pakistani force managed to breakout and fled to Khar, which was under Taliban pressure. It was at this time the Pakistani military unleashed its forces in what many claim ended in a draw. Some 8000 soldiers, 20 Cobra gunships and F16 jets pounded the enemy, which numbered 3000. Pakistan's resolve came into question with this early offensive.&#10;In the game, the Pakistani army does not have unlimited resources to conduct a long offensive as each attack will cost. How well the Pakistani player orchestrates his attack will dictate who the winner is. The Taliban can literally appear and disappear in certain types of terrain making any attack questionable. Their unique movement and evasion will cause any Pakistani player frustration.&#10;&#10;"

Two to four players represent investors in railway companies, spending their initial capital to buy wholly owned Private and Minor Companies and later buying shares in Public Companies. The Public Companies are each controlled by the largest shareholder (its Director). Minor Companies and Public Companies build track and run Trains in order to earn revenues. Public Company revenues can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and Trains. A feature of 1812, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of a Public Company&iacute;s Director and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.&#10;&#10;1812 is a medium length game.
