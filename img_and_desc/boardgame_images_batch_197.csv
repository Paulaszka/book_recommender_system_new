The cards have the name of the location on one side and a map on the other side, showing contiguous locations.&#10;&#10;The object is to void your hand by playing a card with something that shares a borderline with the last card played. Wild cards when played are automatically considered a match and can then be named as any location in the deck except for those in the player's hand. If a player cannot play a contiguous card, cards are drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand until a card can be played.&#10;&#10;Instead of drawing, a player can play a card that does not share a borderline and hope to not be challenged. Challenges can happen after any play. If the challenging player is correct, and the card played does not share a borderline, then the challenged player has to take back the card and take a card from the challenging player's hand. If the challenge is incorrect, the challenger takes a card from the deck and the challenged player gets another turn.&#10;&#10;"

Score sheets, fashioned exactly like bowling scorecards, are used to calculate scores, and series cards are used to record and maintain averages.&#10;&#10;The game can be played as a solo affair, or by any number of players. But six is a recommended maximum, to expedite play.&#10;&#10;Just like bowling in a league, the contestants compete for best average between three complete, 10 frame lines of dice bowling.&#10;&#10;The Dice:&#10;&#10;The Red &amp; White dice are to be rolled together first in each frame. If a STRIKE is rolled, regardless of what is on the other die, this is entered on the scoresheet, and the next player proceeds with their turn.&#10;&#10;A STRIKE is rolled when one of the two dice shows the word, or when the two dice show ten total pins (5 each).&#10;&#10;The Green &amp; White die is rolled when any combination of pins showing on the dice, other than a STRIKE or SPLIT are shown. This die is rolled after the initial roll of the Red &amp; White dice in an attempt to pick up the spare. Also, if SPLIT is showing with 3, 4, or 5 pins on the other die (Red &amp; White Dice) then the player enters the number of pins on the other die as an initial score and rolls the Green &amp; White die to pick up the spare.&#10;&#10;The Blue &amp; White die is rolled when SPLIT appears on the initial Red &amp; White dice roll with 1 or 2 pins showing on the other die. The scorekeeper will enter this as 7 or 8 pins for the first roll. (The SPLIT is counted as six pins plus the 1 or 2 other pins). When either of these combinations occur the player must use the Blue &amp; White die in an effort to pick up the spare.&#10;&#10;One Red &amp; White dice is marked SPLIT, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The other is marked STRIKE, 1, 2,3, 4, 5. The Green &amp; White die is marked SPARE, SPARE, SPARE, SPARE, OPEN, OPEN. The Blue &amp; White die is marked OPEN, OPEN, OPEN, OPEN, SPARE, SPARE.&#10;&#10;About the Publisher/Designer. The game is copyrighted 1979, to J.

The first is the traditional method, in which a piece has to cross to the final row on the opposite side of the board.   The second requires a piece to merely reach any edge, left, right or opposite.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players.   2 players can play using two sets of pieces, either side-by-side or on opposite ends.&#10;&#10;"
