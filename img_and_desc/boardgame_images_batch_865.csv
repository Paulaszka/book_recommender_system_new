Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.&#10;&#10;More specifically, Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.&#10;&#10;Yomi Starter Set: Midori versus Setsuki features two character decks, allowing players to face off immediately. Individual character decks allow new matches to be fought between different pairings.&#10;&#10;Game Modes&#10;&#10;1v1, the main mode&#10;    2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom&#10;    A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent&#10;    A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.&#10;    Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.&#10;    Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.&#10;    Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.&#10;    Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.&#10;    Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.&#10;&#10;Note Contained in:&#10;Yomi (Second Edition)&#10;Yomi: Round 1&#10;&#10;"

If unsuccessful, then the original winner of the trick takes the trick and 50 points for challenging incorrectly.  Players are not allowed to lie when challenged; they must tell the truth.

This eruption coincided with the decline of the Minoan civilization and the rise of the Mycenaean civilization. Due to Thera's strategic location, the Mycanaean wanax (king) has decided that it is time to rebuild Thera and has tasked you, one of his koreters (governors) with this responsibility. The koreter who best rebuilds Thera to its prior glory will be victorious.&#10;&#10;In the role-selection and resource-management game Thera, each player has a map of the island where they will engage in trade, clear ash, generate resources, move those resources to building sites across the island, and construct economic and luxury buildings. On a player's turn, they select one of five roles from the rondel. Every player can benefit from this role, and the one who chose it gets benefits that scale with the amount of favor on the role. Favor accumulates on roles over the course of the game and is redistributed every time a role is chosen. Here's an overview of the five roles:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Priestess prays for rain, bringing the life-giving resource to the island.&#10;    The Worker consumes that water and produces resources.&#10;    The Planner moves those resources around Thera so that they can be used for construction or trade.&#10;    The Builder uses those resources to construct buildings on undeveloped sites across the island.&#10;    The Trader buys and sells resources at the port.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players earn points by constructing buildings. You must get the needed resources to the desired building site, then acquire the building plans (which are available to all from a common building tableau). Should you build another quarry (a resource-generating building), or are you worried one of your competitors will take that temple (a luxury building) that aligns with your strategy? Time is of the essence in Thera, so efficient planning and resource management are important in winning the day.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
