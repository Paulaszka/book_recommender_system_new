Each player controls an airplane that is flying to various &quot;airports&quot;. Each airport is a collection of face down baggage cards. Cards are numbered one through 10, with there being more 1's than 10's. The object of the game is to pick up baggage in ascending numerical order, being the first player to collect numbers 1 to 10.&#10;&#10;This game from Alex Randolph from 1987 uses a similar mechanism as earlier used by Haltet den Dieb (Georg Schittenhelm) in 1975.&#10;&#10;"
3031,,"Players fly their airplane from airport to airport across the United States.  The goal is to deliver passengers to their destination airports.  Players need to decide which passengers to carry on each leg of a journey to maximize the effectiveness of the trip.&#10;&#10;Action cards allow special moves such as non-stop flights.  Players can thwart their opponents by blocking flight paths to airports or loading opponent's passengers.&#10;&#10;The goal is to deliver the most passengers to their respective destinations by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game features a large playing board representing 19 major and minor airports in the USA, 6 plastic passenger planes, and nearly 100 passenger pieces in two sizes.&#10;&#10;Selected for GAMES Magazine's 1986 Games 100 under the heading The Race is On.&#10;&#10;"

There are some important differences.&#10;&#10;In the building phase:  Instead of building a short section of track each turn, players buy an entire route between 2 cities.  The price of the route is determined by its length + $2.  This continues until one player has less than $50 left.  This speeds up the building phase considerably.&#10;&#10;In the racing phase:  All players who compete in the race receive a share of a pot of $30.  Ties on the same number of dice rolled, split their shares of the pot.&#10;&#10;Many maps for different countries have been published.&#10;&#10;"
3034,,"Cluedo Super Sleuth: The Ultimate Challenge is an interesting variant on the famous whodunnit detective game (called Cluedo in the UK, Clue in the US). A well-made production, with pewter figures for the players, it also uses mechanisms which will be new to most non-gamers; the modular board made of tiles, and non-player characters. On the die roll, you wander the mansion, collecting Clues and Items (represented on the board by magnifying glasses and Xs) and making suggestions to other players to see their cards or not. In addition, Event cards (drawn when a red spot is rolled) allow the movement of the non-PCs, Hogarth the Butler, Inspector Grey and The Black Dog. When satisfied that you've identified the murderer, weapon and location, you write your accusation down, make it to the telephone in the main entrance and check the hidden result. &#10;Interesting variant, but still the same basic game.&#10;&#10;The original designer of Cluedo is Anthony E. Pratt, and www.cluedofan.com reckons this is the best edition for tactical play.&#10;&#10;"

Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.&#10;&#10;By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, alerting the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.&#10;&#10;Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French.

The artwork features characters from the movie &quot;Shogun&quot;, and the game can be played in a simple (beginner) or an advanced version, which makes use of all the cards.&#10;&#10;There are two &quot;colors&quot; of cards, peasants and samurai, which are organized into several subclasses like Farmer, Servant, Samurai Wife, or Hatamoto, which all have different point values. Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the &quot;Buddha&quot;) or an elimination card (the &quot;Ninja&quot;) are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.&#10;&#10;But that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. &quot;Passive&quot; means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while &quot;Power Play&quot; can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play &quot;Power Play&quot;, or if you're the player with the highest score this round. For every other &quot;Power Player&quot; there's a hefty point penalty.&#10;&#10;There are even more special cards that I won't go into detail about (such as the &quot;Spy&quot; or the &quot;Hostage&quot;), as well as an intricate turn sequence that allows players to play their cards almost simultaneously. Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.&#10;&#10;Another noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand. At the same time, there's always the shadow of the Ninja looming over the table, and even though it rarely strikes, it can re-arrange the whole score sheet.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has reached 500 points (or 1,000 points for &quot;epic games&quot;).

3076,,"In 'Puerto Rico', players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico, not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.&#10;&#10;"

Pieces knocked into the outer ring are eliminated from the game, but still can prevent future pieces from being knocked into the same spot.  The first player to knock five out of his opponent's nine pieces into the outer ring wins.&#10;&#10;The game is mostly a mixture of attempting to maneuver ones pieces into strong positions, gently bumping them to get high numbers, and sabotaging the opponents' positions so their pieces have more limited movement.&#10;&#10;"

The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;History&#10;The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.&#10;&#10;The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.&#10;Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate.

The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Inspired by Big Two&#10;&#10;"

3099,,"One of the original set of Avalon Hill &quot;Adult Games&quot; that includes U-Boat, Tactics II, Verdict, and Dispatcher.&#10;&#10;This is one of the earliest &quot;typical&quot; wargames, with movement/strength counters, order of appearance chart, CRT, etc.&#10;&#10;Board has square grid with squares 1&quot; = 1/4 mile. One hour turns.&#10;&#10;27 Confederate counters&#10;41 Union counters&#10;&#10;Units include infantry, artillery, cavalry, HQs (but had no use), and outposts (pickets, not in '64 Ed.).&#10;&#10;Roberts redesigned this game in 1961 with hexagons.  Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.&#10;&#10;The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.&#10;&#10;The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.&#10;&#10;The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.&#10;&#10;Every version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).&#10;&#10;"

The strength cards are burned and new cards drawn by each player. For every 3 'power points' a player hold, they can control an area of Europe (by claiming it with 1 of their 7 metal towers).
