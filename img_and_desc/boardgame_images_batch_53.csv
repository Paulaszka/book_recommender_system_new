Players do this by traipsing about the land mustering an army, battling neutral armies, and eventually collecting enough pieces to bring their monster to life.

A deduction game.&#10;Financier - 2-4 players. A stock market game.&#10;&#10;The other two games may have been designed by Phil Orbanes Sr. or by Orbanes and Sackson together (the game credits both of them as designers):&#10;&#10;Pay Off - 2-4 players.

6118,,"Discovery (also sold as Destination Tresor in French, and Discovery Island in Sweden) is an interesting deduction game of discovery. Each player begins in an unknown location on an island (the opponent picks where the other starts), and each has the same goal: find the hidden treasure. The treasure is hidden in one of 28 spots on the island, and there are 7 clues available in special checkpoints to help determine where it is. The island is made up of 5 different types of terrain, and for each type of terrain there is a set of corresponding hexes.&#10;&#10;In play, one player calls a direction (Northeast, South, etc.) and the other player (who knows where you are) reveals a hex on the type of terrain you just stepped into. On the back of the hex there is a number, showing how many hours have been used.  Each turn, a player gets 12 hours worth of movement. By moving this way, you can eventually figure out where you are and then start moving with more accuracy.&#10;&#10;The game uses a clever device that reveals only one spot of a 6 x 6 matrix. A card, from a large set, is initially placed and this determines where the treasure will be for that game. When players get to a checkpoint, they can reveal that spot on the card to get a clue. The clues can tell you which of 4 types of treasure spots is &quot;live&quot;, and also the six surrounding terrain types. The board is well designed so that with a few clues you can narrow down the options of spots.&#10;&#10;Components (Based on Nordic 2002 version)&#10;-    2x Map boards     &#10;-    2x Plastic map sheets     &#10;-    1x Checkometer     &#10;-    28x Checkometer cards     &#10;-    18x Equipment cards     &#10;-    2x Whiteboard pencils     &#10;-    210x Terrain tiles divided as     &#10;-    - 20x Plain tiles     &#10;-    - 82x Jungle tiles     &#10;-    - 35x Mountain tiles     &#10;-    - 50x Swamp tiles     &#10;-    - 20x Outback tiles     &#10;-    - 4x Special tiles&#10;&#10;"

It's not easy to win as the geese. The fascinating game of Merels is better known as Nine Mans Morris and has an entry to itself elsewhere in this database. Alquerque is perhaps the pick of the bunch, with a strategy resembling a cross between draughts and Merels and its influence is clearly to be seen in modern derivatives such as Kensington. Finally, Fierges is identical to draughts but without the compulsion (huffing) rule.

You are a student battling others in a strange, mysterious world. You and your opponent each have 21 points of sanity. Once a player's sanity has been reduced to zero, he loses.&#10;&#10;To reduce your opponent's sanity, you will need to recruit peons, create effects, and use articles in any way possible to destroy your opponent before he destroys you. Your deck is your weapon against your worthy foe. It must contain exactly sixty cards.&#10;&#10;After thoroughly shuffling your deck, each player draws eight cards from the top of the deck. A die is rolled. The player who rolls the highest number goes first.&#10;&#10;When it is your turn, a player first drops a property card. When whacked, or turned sideways, this card, if this card is a brewery yields one unit of alcohol: a convenience store yields one unit of cigarettes. You can now use this unit to recruit peons, create effects, and articles as you see fit.&#10;&#10;Each Peon, article, and effect has a creation cost. It is denoted on the top right hand corner of the card. For each beer bottle, or cigarette shown on a card, one and of the same type must be whacked.&#10;&#10;In the case of peons, the first number in the bottom right hand corner denotes the amount of damage this peon can do to your opponent, or other peons. The second number denotes the amount of damage that it will take to send this peon to the hospital.&#10;&#10;When a peon first comes into play, he is hung over and can't attack, but he can block if he is not whacked. Your peons can attack only on your turn, and only if it is not hung over or whacked. To attack, you must first announce the attack phase, and then whack the peons that are attacking. The opponent then decides which of your peons his peons will block, or he can opt to take the damage himself, reducing his sanity (though only a peon with stealth can block another peon with stealth).&#10;&#10;Unlike a peon, once an effect is cast, it goes directly to the hospital. An article also does not work during the turn it comes into play. and like a peon, it must be whacked to have it's effect. Once you are done attacking, it is your opponent's turn. At the beginning of your next turn, all whacked cards, unless otherwise specified, become unwhacked.
