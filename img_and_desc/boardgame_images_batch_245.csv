If they are able to lay down cards that total eleven (including at least one 1), then they are able to declare takeoff. Subsequent turns allow the player to move closer to the Moon with their rocket parts, crew or cargo. On arriving at the Moon, they need 11 to get back. This journey has to be undertaken 7 times to win. There is a lot of luck in how the cards fall. However it works for young children learning to count.&#10;&#10;Plus rules:&#10;Much like the basic game, except that the game now has Bad Weather (to prevent a takeoff or landing), Meteor Showers (to cause missed turns) and Engine Trouble (to slow down the journey). Of course each problem comes with a solution, Clear Skies, Meteor Shield and Repair Engine.&#10;&#10;2*Plus rules:&#10;Bad Weather can either cause a delayed takeoff (one missed turn) or delayed takeoff until Clear Skies are found.&#10;&#10;3*Plus rules:&#10;There are two spy cards, these cards can abort an Earth takeoff completely.&#10;&#10;4*Plus rules:&#10;The spies become one for the Moon and one for the Earth. Aborting an Earth takeoff just delays the journey. Aborting a Moon landing makes the entire journey useless, and they still have to get back to Earth to start another journey.&#10;&#10;5*Plus rules:&#10;Either the journey cards are played like Gin Rummy, when a set is complete, or the journey can be accumulated as they are in Mille Bornes&#10;&#10;The game played at 4*Plus can take well over 4 hours, with each Spy testing the best of friendships.&#10;&#10;"

A United States citizen twenty-one years old could file a claim on 160 acres of public land which he wished to own as a home for himself and his family.  If he lived there for five years, had built a house and was raising crop, he was given title to the land.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The country was wild, the problems faced by the &quot;sod-busters&quot; were great.

For example, smaller ones are faster but the larger ones are stronger, so they can displace them. Points are gained by fulfilling tasks. The better you fulfill the task, the more points you get.
