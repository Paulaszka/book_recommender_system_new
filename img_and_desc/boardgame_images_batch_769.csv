The playing board is only seven spaces wide and 14 rows deep, with four 2-space blanks in the middle rows that force attacks to go through the remaining three channels.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces are wooden triangles that stand up so only the owning player can see their values. Players set up freely on their side of the board and than move them one at a time to attack opposing pieces and eventually capture the enemy flag piece.&#10;&#10;Each side has 33 pieces, ranging in value from 11 (Scharfshutze or Sharpshooter) to 1 (Feldmarschall or Field Marshal). In general, the lower value beats the higher value, with equal values causing mutual destruction. However, the Scharfshutze kills the Feldmarschall while losing to everything else, and Mines kill anything that attacks them, but cannot move or attack.&#10;&#10;"

It was during that period the conventional &ldquo;correlation of forces&rdquo; between the two hostile alliances most favored the communists.&#10;&#10;The scenario portrayed is the one that was most anticipated and feared by NATO&rsquo;s intelligence analysts at the time. That is, despite their knowledge of the existence of Soviets plans to begin such a war with massive chemical and nuclear strikes, the West&rsquo;s military planners gave those schemes little credence. They knew the Soviets understood such a strategy would bring on immediate nuclear retaliation by the West. That would&rsquo;ve ended the war as quickly as it began &ndash; mostly likely along with all of civilization &ndash; with no winner identifiable.&#10;&#10;What was feared then was, one fine summer day, the Soviet units in East Germany would move out from eating breakfast in their mess halls and roll across the border into West Germany. It would&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;come as you are&rdquo; kind of war, the aim of which would&rsquo;ve been to blitz across Germany &ndash; using only conventional weaponry &ndash; in under a month.&#10;&#10;The Soviets would then have called for a ceasefire before any nuclear or chemical weapons had been detonated or the massive economic power of the Atlantic community brought to bear. With that, West Germany &ndash; the geo-strategic lynchpin of NATO in Europe &ndash; would&rsquo;ve been neutralized and its Ruhr industrial area &ndash; then as now, one of the most important manufacturing centers on the planet &ndash; entirely wrecked. That would&rsquo;ve caused a shift in the global balance of power in favor of the Kremlin, setting them up to deliver the knockout blow later.&#10;&#10;The 50&rdquo; x 35&rdquo; map covers the core area of the Federal Republic of Germany at 6.66 miles (10.8 km) per hex. There are 352 large-size (5/8&rdquo;) unit counters, representing the divisions and brigades immediately on scene at the time, along with the masses of other units that could&rsquo;ve been sent as reinforcements.

Special rules account for heliborne units, Spetsnaz, the ultra-elite Soviet Eighth Guards and Guards Airborne Armies, East German and Czechoslovakian disloyalty, ranged Soviet artillery divisions, air power, supply, the criticality of Frankfurt for US operations, paradrops, German territorials, electronic warfare and variable Soviet victory objectives.&#10;&#10;The overall system is simple, at about 6 on the 1-10 scale.

An auction phase is followed by card playing. Four hands are dealt: one per player plus an additional one which is placed face-up on the table (the &quot;dummy&quot;); initially, one player is allowed to exchange his hand with the dummy. During the auction phase the players attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding; like in Bridge, bids specify how many tricks must be taken and what is the preferred trump suit (or lack thereof); in addition, bids also have a &quot;color&quot; that indicates what is the preferred partnership for that deal. After the auction, the team that has won the bid (the &quot;declarers&quot;) tries to win as many tricks as possible; the other player (the &quot;defender&quot;) plays both his own hand and the dummy's, and tries to take enough tricks to have the declarers fail their contract. The scoring system is almost identical to Bridge, but players have individual scores.&#10;&#10;Swingbridge is presented as a book, written for an audience of Bridge players, which contains the basic rules of the game, some optional variants, and an in-depth analysis of the mechanics and peculiarities of the game.&#10;&#10;"
