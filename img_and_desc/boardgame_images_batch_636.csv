Have you ever imagined leading troops, which included elephants over the Pyrenees and the Alps to try to conquer Rome? Have you enjoyed a good historical novel dated on the old Republic of Rome, and you would like to travel to that time?&#10;&#10;ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is a war game similar to miniatures games in which both sides fight an ancient battle. The game is mainly based on the II Punic war, although battles from III to I B.C centuries can be also simulated. The game concept combines both, orders and events cards, that makes each game different and each combat becomes unpredictable and thrilling. ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm).&#10;&#10;Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants. Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements.  Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated, meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.&#10;&#10;Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters. Both, Hannibal and Scipio, two well-known Generals are included in the game with their unique set of bonuses! Also, Heroes, Veterans and Elite units take part in Onus!&#10;&#10;ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is played in turns, composed by six different phases each:&#10;&#10;1.    Activation of Units: in this phase, the active player can play any number of Order cards from his hand, stating what units are going to be used during the turn.&#10;2.    Movement and Charges: in this phase, the active player may move all those units activated in the previous phase. Those units finishing their movement in contact with enemy units, may Charge against them.&#10;3.    Range Attack: those active units able to carry out Ranged Attacks and which haven&rsquo;t moved or executed a Reduced Movement may shoot enemies within its maximum range. Also, special units like Skirmirsher have this skill, thus they may want to use this ability.&#10;4.      Skirmishers: units having these specific skill can harass enemy units, provided they haven't spent all their movement points.&#10;5.    Combat: All engagements are resolved in this phase, being the active player the one choosing the order of combats.&#10;6.    Flee Movement: units fleeing continue their movement if Morale checks fail.&#10;&#10;"

During the very same day, a battle took place, the battle that after many years later became a symbol of clash of old cavalry formations with modern tank units. Poles from Wolynska Cavalry Brigade bravely resisted the German attack of 4th Panzer Division. Regardless of concentrated tank assaults supported with artillery and airstrikes, Germans hadn`t achieved their objectives. Defenders suffered heavy casualties but retained fighting capability and continued to fight in the days to come.&#10;&#10;Mokra, 1st September 1939 allows not only to recreate those events but also to check different hypothetical scenarios. Players decide about their forces` movement and they organize attacks or defense. Both sides enjoy certain advantages. Germans have large number of motorized units and strong air force.

Though, the pieces and their abilities, in addition to 20-sided dice (called action dice, or AD) are what makes this game maintain its role-playing aspect. Each character has the following attributes:&#10;&#10;Hitpoints: Ranging from 8 to 14. Based on the physical prowess of a character, the Hitpoints of the character can change. for example, the Sorcerer only has 8 hitpoints, while the Knight has 12 and the Warrior has 14.&#10;&#10;Armor Points: Ranging from 1 to 4. The difference between armor and health being that you can roll a D20 to try and negate damage as damage will always go to armor first.&#10;&#10;Accuracy: This is broken up into either melee, ranged, magic, or shield accuracy. You must roll equal to or higher than the indicated number. Rolling a 19 or 20 will cause a CRIT, usually causing double damage. When you have to hit your target you roll however many action dice your weapon allows. Refer to your accuracy, and if the dice you rolled are equal to or above your accuracy, you successfully hit.&#10;&#10;Weapons: Each character has some form of a melee weapon. Most characters will be able to cause either 4 or 6 total damage with their weapon. Though the way it is caused is different for every character. The knight with a flail rolls 1 action dice causing 6 damage. While the Crusader with his longsword rolls 6 action dice each causing only 1damage. The Cleric with his hand mace causes 4damage with 1 action dice, while the Sorcerer and their casting staff rolls 2 action dice each causing 2 damage.&#10;&#10;Movement: Movements between the characters vary based on their maneuverability and battlefield mobility. The ranger holds roots to the Bishop of Chess, allowing them to go as far as they want in a diagonal line. The knight is able to move in the classic 'L-move' associated with knights of Chess. Though when it comes to the Crusader (able to move up to 2 squares diagonally) or Assassin(able to move up to 2 squares in ANY direction) Cathedr'l takes on its own personality as characters must use their unique movement to navigate the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Spells: The Sorcerer, Cleric, and Paladin, utilize magic to support themselves and their allies in combat with powerful abilities only used by the select few magic users of Cathedr'l.&#10;&#10;Abilities: Abilities are what will allow certain characters their unique traits. The Warrior and his Charge ability allow him, like a pawn, to move up to 2 squares on his first movement. The Paladin with the ability of STED, has built extreme strength and endurance and has an extra Hitpoint that regenerates at the end of every turn, essentially ignoring 1 point of damage whenever he is hit.&#10;&#10;Using a system that is as deep and complex, as a tried and true RPG, and the unique strategy offered by chess, both players will use strategy and the role-playing aspect of a 20-sided Action Dice in order to outsmart and gain better positioning against their opponents. &#10;   &#10;   In order to beat the game, you must slay your opponents King AND Queen. After slaying either of the two 'royal' characters on your opponent's team, all of the their characters that started the game on their respective royal's side of the board, go into exile and are removed from play. This allows for another layer of strategy as slaying your opponents king or queen can leave your opponent at half strength and weak against your troops.&#10;&#10;"

After the fall of Mussolini and the declaration of war to Germany, Italy overthrew the course of the war. Playing Resistance you can choose to control the partisans, aiming to spread over the country to get consensus and support. Or you can step into the role of the Axis, trying to stifle resistance or discredit it.&#10;&#10;Resistance is a strategic light wargame with historical and political elements for 2 players, which assume the role of the forces of the Axis or the Partisans. The game map outlines the North of Italy, enclosed to the south by the Gothic Line.&#10;&#10;When playing Resistance you should give up concepts such as the &quot;front line&quot; and &quot;grouping military forces&quot;. On the opposite, Axis and partisan must aim to spread themselves all over the country: the Axis should try to surround and round up the enemies, while the partisan should try to exercise political control over the population.&#10;&#10;The Axis player controls a number of variable military units (about 20): the exact number depends by the political situation. The partesan player controls from 1 to 50 partesan units: the exact number dependes by the consensus coming from civilian population. The partesan player goal is to control the territory, in order to recruit more people than those dying each turn (which is inevitable). On average the partesan player should be able to recruit about 30-40 units of partesan fighters during a play, and lose about 10-20. This implies that the partesan ends the game with about 20 units. Since the Axis players has about the same number of units, the player having the number supremacy at the end of the play wins the game.&#10;&#10;Resistance is based on very light wargame concepts. The actual game engine is the struggle for getting control over territory and raising population support.&#10;&#10;"

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;The new buildings are: Aqueduct, Forest House, Black Market, Storehouse, Guesthouse, Church, Trading Post, Small Wharf, Lighthouse, Library, Speciality Factory, Union Hall, Cloister, and Statue.&#10;&#10;"

The resource roundel is used to control the availability of resources to the players and also to establish which player is in control of the game at any given time.&#10;&#10;Each player is managing one or two IT services, where each service relies upon one application and several technical services (represented in the Stabil-IT matrix).&#10;&#10;Over the course of six rounds, each player performs actions to improve the confidence in their IT services and to life-cycle them to an updated version. Each action takes one or more resources which can be technical specialists, application specialists or analysts/test specialist.&#10;At certain points in the game, stress tests are carried out to find the weakest point in the matrix which leads to a loss of confidence at that point. If there is no confidence to lose, an incident occurs.&#10;&#10;Solving an incident may result in gaining permanent or temporary knowledge which you can use to reduce the resources needed for your actions or retained to give points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"

Using his symbol cards, each player tries to change the layout to match the arrangement of the colors or shapes to the tasks given. The player to have the most symbols on the task cards collected wins the game &mdash; but because everyone plays simultaneously and the task cards can be turned around in your head any way you like, the game forms a solid color challenge for players.&#10;&#10;"
