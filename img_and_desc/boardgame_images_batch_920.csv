The Ranger was built as a warship while the Drake was simply a merchant ship outfitted with 4-pound cannons. Not to mention, Jones had the upper hand in knowledge of the enemy ship, given to him by an area local Lieut.Dobbs.

Lastly it has to at least &lsquo;feel&rsquo; reasonable, I like to get a flavour of the period I am covering.&#10;&#10;I have played WW3 games where largely speaking if you can see the target you can hit it, and if you can hit it you can kill it. I personally do not think in the heat of battle it is that easy to hit and kill a main battle tank. That is of course only my opinion, I have never been in the military and WW3 never happened so to some degree all WW3 rule sets are based on someone's opinion, but it is the basis of these rules, you will find even the hardest tank can be killed, though not necessarily easily, and even the least armoured tank has some chance of surviving long enough to achieve something.&#10;&#10;I have provided army lists for the major armies defending or threatening Western Europe, I have split the period into 3 time periods, effectively the beginning of the 1980&rsquo;s, the end and of course the middle.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
