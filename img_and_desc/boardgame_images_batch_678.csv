In this version of the game, players start with a set amount of money.  They then roll a die and move a pawn along a track.  Each space will instruct them to buy one or more items, buy for a friend, return a previously bought item and collect money, or lose a turn.  If an item must be bought, the player draws a card, passes it through the &quot;secret scanner&quot; and then pays the indicated amount back into the cash register.  Coupon spaces reduce the price of items.  Once one player reaches the end the track, the game ends and the player with the most money remaining wins.  Unlike Shopping Cart Match, there is no strategy to this version of the game, although players must be able to make change.&#10;&#10;"

Players move throughout London marshaling and managing resources, investigating leads, and thwarting the agents of an unknown mastermind before time runs out.&#10;&#10;Players take the role of investigators that have influence within different realms of British society (politics, science, occult, and the underworld).

Leads relating to the conspiracy are represented by facedown cards tied to notable London locations. Players move their figures throughout the city, revealing lead cards, expending their investigator's influence tokens to acquire those leads, and deciding how to apply them toward the conspiracy's hidden aspects.&#10;&#10;Time is not on their side. Mismanaging the clock or their influence tokens causes leads to go cold, traumatizing investigators and bringing the conspiracy closer to its dreadful realization. Worse, as the investigators come closer to the truth, the mastermind dispatches agents to stymie their movements, disrupt their efforts (by forcing them to discard influence tokens), and assassinate them (by causing trauma).&#10;&#10;Identifying the elements of the conspiracy leads the players to a climactic confrontation. If the precise combination of influence is accrued and the investigators assemble at the correct locale, the queen is saved and the British Empire preserved; however, if too many leads go cold, Big Ben strikes midnight, or the investigators are too traumatized, a dire fate awaits.&#10;&#10;"

Nothing beats that moment of suspense as you push your luck to the extreme, only to be rewarded by  glorious victory for your bravery.&#10;&#10;In the light and casual game Queen of the Hill, players are queens vying for control of a celestial hill. Taking turns, they attempt to Gather, Form and Keep the strongest female warriors from different worlds and eras to join their army. However, this is a very dangerous act, and they cannot always control what they Gather. At the end of every round, players compare their total warrior scores Formed and the highest score wrests control of the hill. Control the hill twice and a player wins the game! Watch out though, the Dark One (also the only male in the game) might accidentally be Gathered and he will prey upon all the ladies. If you push your luck too hard, you might end up drawing him, and he will clear all your points and force you to end your gathering phase. How lucky are you feeling today? How far do you dare to push your luck? The more you push your luck without drawing the Dark One, the more likely the next opponent will attract him.

If he Keeps her in his hand, she will not contribute any Battle Points to the player's score this round and be set aside for now. She does not go into the player's hand immediately.

Battles are a large portion of the game since you will deal with them on the way to and during a warlord battle or most end events. During battles, players draw a hand and decide what cards to play based on what their ship and crew enable them to play. They roll for the actions of their enemy and resolve the damage. This process repeats until one side or the other has been destroyed. When you win a battle you take the due rewards which can be used to trade for additional ship upgrades or crew members.

If he uses his Tactics cards, the active player may change the number rolled on his die.&#10;     After that, he immediately carries out an action; e.g., he can substitute a playing figure with a &quot;3&quot; and strengthen his own defense, or he can try to start an offense to get a chance of throwing a goal. Then, with his die, the passive player has a consequent reaction, e.g., guarding opposing offense spaces with a &quot;1,&quot; or fine-tuning his own tactics.&#10;     Both players try to use their &quot;all-rounder&quot; (a playing figure with special abilities) tactically and cleverly; there are different kinds of throws, fouls with 2-minute penalties, yellow cards and just one &quot;Super Glove&quot;; for reinforcement, the &quot;Team Spirit&quot; comes into play&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;The player who has &quot;thrown&quot; the most goals by the end of the game wins. And who else does? Of course, the player with the best tactics, the fastest pace, and with the Team Spirit as the eighth player on his side.&#10;&#10;"

It is intended both for hobby play and for use in professional education about humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.&#10;&#10;The game is set in the fictional country of Carana, but is loosely modeled on disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. It explores approximately three months of humanitarian operations, including both the initial emergency and a later period of early recovery. Because Carana is a fragile, conflict- affected country, relief and reconstruction efforts may also involve issues of social unrest and political instability, especially during the early recovery stage once the initial shock of the crisis has worn off.&#10;&#10;The primary objective of all players is to address the urgent humanitarian needs of the local population (thereby scoring &quot;relief points&quot;). However, players also need to maintain public and political support for their organizations (&quot;operations points&quot;), whether to govern (Carana), sustain the relief mission (HADR-TF), or secure financial support (UN and NGOs).&#10;&#10;&quot;At-Risk&quot; cards indicate the current emergency needs for food, water/sanitation, medical, or shelter supplies in each district of the capital. Players must bring the necessary supplies into the country, and allocate aid teams to deliver them in time. Aid teams might also be engaged in rescue operations, aid coordination, needs assessment, infrastructure repair, public relations or other key tasks. Event cards inject many of the numerous challenges associated with relief operations into game play, but also indicate the self-help efforts of the local population as they struggle to survive and recover.&#10;&#10;Game play is cooperative, but it is possible for some, all, or no player to win.&#10;&#10;"

Start at the base of the pyramid and reach the top to pick up a key to the underground labyrinth. Each player uses a reel to find their starting space and the path they have to take to get to the top. They use the dice to move to each space shown on the reels. The sphinxes can be placed to delay the players - needing to roll the number on the back of the sphinx to pass.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one who has completed the route in the correct way, and if there is more than one who has done this, the one who arrived first.&#10;&#10;"

Game play begins in June 1991 when Slovenia and Croatia proclaimed independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and ends in early 1992.&#10;&#10;There are two players in WRTE: The Federalist player and the Separatist player. The Federalist player assumes the role of the commander of the People&rsquo;s Army of Yugoslavia (JNA), the only Federal institution still working in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s (the Federalist player must fight low morale, politicos, and the Separatists to keep Yugoslavia united, or at least to retain the largest possible tract of Serb-inhabited territory). The Separatist player represents the governments of the breakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia fighting for independence and a free market economy.&#10;&#10;"

It creates an atmosphere of exhilaration, where a couple can experience something similar to those initial &quot;falling in love&quot; feelings. During this process, true intimacy is developed and deepened. That being said, the game is also competitive; the couple competes one against the other as they both enjoy the benefits of their new-found intimacy. It is simply a great date night in a box&mdash; accessible anytime and anywhere&mdash; no costs, no distractions, no preparations, no planning.&#10;&#10;The Discovery Game is effective for the newlywed, the empty-nester, for couples that are very close and those who are struggling. This is possible because the couple controls the content and the pace of intimacy. The discovery game simply provides the environment and the parameters necessary for a great date to take place. Consequently, the game provides the perfect environment for a connected couple seeking an exciting night of physical intimacy, while also providing the perfect environment for a couple hoping to re-establish friendly lines of communication.&#10;&#10;The game is a Focus on the Family &quot;Reviewed&quot; product. It has also received endorsements from FamilyLife, The American Association of Christian Counselors and Shaunti Feldhahn (the best-selling author of &quot;For Men Only and For Women Only&quot;).&#10;&#10;In that there are property spaces one may purchase, and because the Reality Check spaces often impart financial setbacks similar to those encountered in real life, The discovery Game is sometimes said to be similar to Monopoly and the Game of Life. The discover Game is different from those games in that it was designed to generate intimacy in a relationship. To that end, the discovery spaces are among the most important spaces on the board. For when a player lands on a discovery space he or she draws a discovery card. The cards prompt the player to several types of actions&mdash; all of which promote intimacy. The discovery Game is also unlike many adult board games which are purposed on inducing sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is often the outcome for many couples as they play, and The discovery Game does encourage mild physical intimacy and hugs, it is never coercive. Sexual intimacy that is spawned by The discovery Game is always the free choice of the players&mdash; as a couple&mdash; and the natural result of emotional intimacy.&#10;&#10;Spaces unique to the game are:&#10;&#10;     The &quot;Wish Space&quot; (when a player lands on this space, using the included sand-timer, he or she must perform the wishes of his or her partner for two minutes. These wishes might be sexual in nature, but they might also involve household chores&mdash; It is always up to the players and the actions must be mutually consensual).&#10;     The &ldquo;Center Square&rdquo; (is a jackpot where monies from the players are directed at various points in the game. If a player enters the Center Square and rolls doubles, he or she acquires all of the money in the jackpot. If a player cannot roll doubles he or she can use his or her &ldquo;Get Out of Center&rdquo; card. If he or she has already used that card, the player may exit the Center Square by removing an article of clothing (socks, shoes, shirt, it is the players choice). A player can enter and exit this space from any Reality Check or discovery space on the board, and the Reality Check and discovery spaces are located all around the board. This makes the Center Square an extremely helpful way of navigating the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;One of the greatest things about The Discovery Game is, no one feels like they are working on their marriage! It's just fun! This is a tool that has been used by thousands of strong and struggling marriages alike, to move them toward passion. It normally takes at least an hour to complete. However, because much of the game is dependent on the discussions which ensue from the discovery cards, the discussions themselves determine the time it takes to play the game.&#10;&#10;"
