It seems that Aurora's lifeless body was found on the cold, dirt floor of her cell in the Salem Prison for Wicked Women.  The letter &quot;A&quot; had been hastily sewn to the bodice of her dress and a black candle was found in her left hand. Aurora's lips had been stitched closed, coins had been placed on her eyelids and a hazelnut was found in each ear.&#10;&#10;So what happened?&#10;&#10;Many of the townspeople had been witness to strange and uncanny happenings around and about the Nightstorm cottage.  Some say that Aurora could take down a huge oak, chop it into firewood and stack it at her back door....with just the twitch of her nose. Others testify to have seen Aurora levitate to the top of her roof to rescue her curious, black feline....her faithful companion, &quot;Wee Gee&quot;.....and children claim to have seen Aurora fly through the sky chasing vampire bats. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that Governor Giles Bickford was presented with a petition for her arrest. The document had been signed by every man, woman and child in Salem.  Hence, the Governor had no alternative but to bring charges of &quot;Witchcraft&quot; against Aurora Nightstorm.&#10;&#10;The trial was swift, the outcome, evident. Aurora was to swing from the gallows until dead.  But sometime during the pre-dawn hours someone paid Aurora a &quot;final visit&quot;. Alas, the townspeople will witness no vengeance against Aurora, their proclaimed, evil one. Who was it that dared enter her cell?  Who had reason to preempt the hangman?....and why??  To resolve this mystery one must be ready to venture back to the days of witch-hunts and sorcery. So, gather those black capes and broomsticks and come join the &quot;Sisters Three&quot; &ndash; Haggatha, Tabitha and Elain;  the Village Virgin, the Ghost of Lady Bickford, Evil Omen and the Reverend Smiley to name a few.&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to get to the other side of the game board.&#10;2. The game board is divided into squares, but you're not told how many squares wide or long it is.&#10;3. You can only step on a square if it has a tile on it. You can step on any tile, even if it was made by another player.&#10;4. If you step on an empty square, or the tile you're standing on breaks, then you &quot;fall in&quot; and have to swim back to the nearest tile.&#10;5. Each empty square that either borders a tile or the starting edge of the game board has a question visible on it. The questions are very simple and have single answers, such as &quot;why does water flow downhill?&quot; or &quot;why can light pass through glass?&quot; or &quot;what is heat?&quot;&#10;6. The only way to make new tiles is by making-up an answer to the question.&#10;7. A tile will only float if you can verify the answer with a reproducible test.&#10;8. A tile can only be broken by proving the answer is wrong with a reproducible test.&#10;9. A test can't break a tile if its results can't be reproduced, a tile can't float if the verifying test's results can't be reproduced.&#10;10. If a tile is broken, then all tiles ahead of it that cannot be connected back to the starting edge by another continuous series of tiles will be broken as well.&#10;11. A player is defined as someone who obeys the rules. If you stop obeying the rules you cease to be a player until you start obeying the rules again.&#10;&#10;Further explanation of the rules can be found at: &#10;http://www.disenchanted.com/technology/game.html&#10;&#10;"

The combat system uses a combat results table (CRT) and the monthly game turn has several phases.

Pieces can never &ldquo;go through&rdquo; or &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; other pieces, both of the same or different colours.&#10;&#10;Each piece can be oriented in four different ways (one per each side of the piece) enabling it to four different kind of movement.&#10;&#10;The active roles is the one facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;These are the four roles a piece can assume:&#10;&#10;- Warrior:&#10;        it moves 1 square and can't go backwards, in other words it can&#10;        move to one of the 5 squares adjacent to it (W, NW, N, NE, E);&#10;- Blade:&#10;        it moves 1 or 2 square &ldquo;forward&rdquo; (N);&#10;- Catapult:&#10;        it can move up to 3 squares diagonally going only forward, as&#10;        usual (NE, NW);&#10;- Shield:&#10;        the only role that can go backwards, it can move up to 2 squares&#10;        going South or just 1 square going diagonally (SW or SE).&#10;&#10;Begining of the game&#10;&#10;The first player to move will be the one opening the table.

Corners with anchors of a player's own color are his home corners, and corners with anchors of his opponent's color are away corners. A group is an anchor if it touches three or more sides of the board. If a group touches just two sides, it is an anchor only if these two sides do not meet at an away corner. When both players pass consecutively, any group that is not an anchor is ruled dead and is removed from the board.

If there is insufficient money for one of the players, they take nothing from the cemetery, and so do the players after them.&#10;&#10;Apart from money cards, there are also special cards which change the outcome of the robbery:&#10;&#10;     Guard - Prevent the players from stealing the money. Everyone who invested 0 in this robbery receives 5 regardless of the money in the cemetery.&#10;     Bandit - Prevent the players from stealing the money and also steal the money invested in this robbery by all players.&#10;     Accomplice - Reverse the order of players taking the money.&#10;     Widow - Cancels all other special cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;When the deck is depleted, play continues until one of the players uses all of their cards. After that, the players rob all the cemeteries one after another and then the game is over. The player who earned the most coins is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
