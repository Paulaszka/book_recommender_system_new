You buy, sell and trade properties and building plots to win. You will feel at home on the game board, going from Norrliden to Varvsholmen. Cards with pictures and instructions take you from familiar and unfamiliar situations and locations in the historical, contemporary and future Kalmar.&#10;&#10;Players assume the role of landlords, purchasing and trading streets, squares and properties. Players landing on the streets and squares of other players must pay rent depending on if the plot is empty or if properties have been built on the plot. The unique plots for the squares Larmtorget, Stortorget, Lilla Torget and Skvallertorget, and for the local newspapers &Ouml;stran and Barometern, are unbuildable, meaning that the rent is fixed; buying more of the same set garners you more money when players land on those plots.&#10;&#10;Players play the game by rolling two dice, adding the sum together and moving on the game board equal to the sum of the dice. Players may only buy properties that are unowned, and it takes owning all streets of an individual color set to be able to build properties on the streets. For example, to be able to build properties on Norrliden, Funkabo must also be owned by you, as it belongs to and completes the orange set. While moving along the board, players may also land on tile which force you to draw cards, whose effects may be both beneficial and disadvantageous.&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is, by the roll of the dice and mercantile shrewdness, to be the last player left with money, having forced your competitors into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

He controls more than 80% of drug trafficking worldwide. His personal fortune is estimated between 25 and 30 billion dollars. Those who oppose him and refuse to be bribed are murdered by his men. He is one of the most powerful men in the world, and only the DEA and a small group of incorruptible local agents stand between him and his ultimate goal: to become the President of Colombia.&#10;&#10;In Narcos Plata o Plomo one player takes control of El Patr&oacute;n's empire while the other players have to cooperate to surround and capture him in Medellin before he gets enough influence to achieve his goal. For the law forces it is a race against time: the advance of El Patr&oacute;n is implacable, so they must gather all their strength and recover control of the city comuna to comuna, cornering him before the elections turn him into the future President of the country and, therefore, untouchable to the forces of law.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The goal is to build the highest mountains by stacking the various pieces of wood, measuring them and summing these measurements to reach 100 cm. The first player to reach 100 cm or more wins.&#10;&#10;Each player builds his mountain during turn by turn. The smallest player starts. In front of him, he places the base of the mountain (wooden board) and the tokens with the symbols facing down. He randomly turns a first token, takes the piece of wood with the corresponding symbol and places it on the wooden base. The player has the right to place it on the position he chooses, but only on the edge ! This is the first part of the mountain.&#10; Next, he turns a second token, places once again the corresponding piece of wood on the previous piece and continues to build his mountain. The player may, at any time, decide to continue or interrupt his construction. If the player is satisfied with his mountain, he stops, measures its height and writes down the score. The next player can start. If, on the other hand, the player continues and his construction collapses, his score will be zero for that round and the turn of the next player begins.&#10;&#10;"

The most famous one takes place at Aomori, and is considered as an intangible national treasure in Japan. During the festival, huge floats (Nebuta) are paraded through the town, depicting brave warrior figures or kabuki style heroes and gods or just local celebrities, and dancers walk alongside dressed in special costume (Haneta). They perform a sort of bouncing dance as they walk, and call to the mass of tourists to join in.

Each player gets a specific dancer card, showing their colour and their own dance move. The players stand around the table, taking turns to play a card from their hand to the centre in rhythm with the chant. All the players keep up the chant, Rasse ra, Rasse ra, RasseRasseRasse ra, and according to which cards are played (by colour and form), different players must perform their correct slow bouncing dance steps.

Each player is a Summoner, bringing great characters from out of History in order to fight for the Holy Grail. But something has gone wrong with your Summoner powers, and you end up with a mix of parts from different heroes. You must combine them as best as possible and send them into battle.&#10;&#10;Each player puts together their fighter from body parts of legendary people. Each historical figure has been separated into three parts. Starting with a hand of 7 cards, each tries to form a historical figure by combining the right arm (red card), torso (green), and left arm (purple) cards. Each body part card also contains a third of the person's name and their achievement, like &quot;SOC / RA / TES&quot; and &quot;One of the founders of / Western philosophy and the first / Moral philosopher&quot;. Each card also has icons indicating its 'military power' and intellectual power'. There are also weapon cards (blue). The weapon might go on the right arm of the character.&#10;&#10;Before each round, a Holy Grail Piece card is drawn to indicate the victory condition of the current battle, such as 'higher intellectual power' and 'lower military power. In this way, the strongest one is not necessarily the winner.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns to draw and exchange cards between themselves until one player Summons up and announces their chimeric historical figure to enter the tournament, displaying their chosen limbs and torso. That player also announces their opponent. The battle begins when the chosen opponent has also summoned their hero. When the battle is over, the winner announces another player as their opponent and the loser discards their chimera.&#10;&#10;After each player has fought that round, the final winner claims the Grail card as their prize. Turning it over reveals the lower torso which is placed on their champion, to enter the Hall of Fame. The game edns when a player makes the required number of Hall of Fame heroes according to the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game is intended as a party game as much as a serious combat game. It is as much about making a chimera with a name and achievement that fits your sense of humour as about winning the actual tournaments. The game was an instant sell-out hit at the Tokyo Game Market in Autumn 2018.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;In this game, the players are up-and-coming summoners skilled in summoning great historical figures. Once every ten years, the summoners gather at the battle tournament to win the holy grail.&#10;You have carefully prepared yourselves for the battle, but the Holy Grail has suddenly run out of control. Your summoning circles have all fallen to pieces, and you can only summon parts of unidentified historical figures. Still, the battle has already begun.&#10;&#10;Can you combine the parts of historical figures in your hand to create the most powerful one and win through the battle?&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#176;&#134;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#190;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#132;&#170;&#231;&#167;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#230;&#132;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;10&#229;&#185;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#232;&#129;&#150;&#230;&#157;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#177;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#130;&#229;&#138;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#229;&#191;&#181;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#186;&#150;&#229;&#130;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#135;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#170;&#129;&#229;&#166;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#129;&#150;&#230;&#157;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#154;&#180;&#232;&#181;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#176;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#230;&#179;&#149;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#172;&#229;&#150;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#228;&#184;&#141;&#230;&#152;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#151;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#142;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#129;&#137;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#132;&#161;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#230;&#138;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;"

Typically, a separate player acts as a Reader by reading out loud from a separate deck. Players then deduce from what is read which card on display is the target, and move swiftly.&#10;&#10;In this game of Shingon Karuta, the designer aimed to improve the education of Buddhist iconography. There is a deck of Bodhisattva cards and a deck of Shingon cards.  A Bodhiattva is a person on the path to Buddhahood, and such people are widely depicted in temple artwork, in sculpture and painting. Shingon Buddhism is one of the main schools in Japan, and the Shingon deck has sections of mantras that relate to specific Bodhisattva images.&#10;&#10;As the Shingon card is read out, each player tries to identify the matching Bodhisattva card and snatch it or keep it.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 2017, but revised in 2019 to unify the artwork to one style. The designer realised that players could simply learn the deck by the different style of artworks, and not by learning the actual Bodhisattvas. By making all the art unified, the game becomes much harder.&#10;&#10;In 2018, the designer published an explansion set of 10 more Bodhisattva cards and 10 matching Shingon cards. Players could just play with this expansion set alone. This deck was integrated into the 2019 edition too.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Each player strives to become the most powerful ruling force in the kingdom by gaining control of Fiefs and Bishoprics. In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery, and deception!&#10;&#10;FIEF is a classic game and this edition includes a new board (FIEF France: Gameboard)!&#10;&#10;The game board represents the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre. Bishoprics include several different Fiefs' villages.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In FIEF France edition, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl, or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, they gain 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. &quot;your&quot;) fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10;&#10;You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to attain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is &quot;mysteriously&quot; murdered or dies by some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny. Bounty Event cards are beneficial to the Player and include &quot;Good Harvest&quot;, &quot;Good Weather&quot;, and &quot;Added Taxes&quot; cards. But some cards are Disaster Cards that can randomly affect all players in specific Bishoprics. These include &quot;The Plague&quot;, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, &quot;Famine&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Uprising&quot;!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men-at-Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Archers and Bombards. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll. Each &quot;f&quot; rolled is a hit. Men-at-Arms are defeated with one hit, while Knights require three hits to be removed from the battle.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Two to four players can brawl in this mental slap-stick game as they pit their moves against each other. You start out by picking one of four wacky wrestlers; &quot;Glittersaurus Wrecks&quot;, &quot;Mountain Man Rick&quot;, &quot;El Alacran&quot;, or &quot;The She-E-O&quot; with their arsenal of insane moves to take out their opponents. Whoever wins the most cards wins the game and you do that by collecting the most tricks. (Publisher Description)&#10;&#10;Slamorama is a 2-4 player wrestling card game from Binary Cocoa! Players all play their best moves against each other to win rounds, and whoever wins the most rounds by the time the cards are gone wins the game!&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;1. Each player is given a deck of 13 cards that consists of wrestling moves like punches or slaps or suplexes. 1 is the strongest &quot;move&quot; card, while 7 is the weakest.&#10;&#10;2. Players then count to three and throw down what they think will be the strongest move, and whoever that is wins the round! On a tie players throw down an additional card until someone finally wins. No one wins the round if the tie occurs on the last round.&#10;&#10;3. Rounds go until all players decks are empty, and whoever wins the most rounds wins!&#10;&#10;Special Features:&#10;1. Each wrestler has a signature move that fits their persona. For example. Mountain Man Rick's Special move is the Salmon Slam. He literally picks people up and swings them around like a bear on the Snake River. Glittersaurus Wrecks special move is the rise and shine. She will lift you up just to bring you down. Very down.&#10;&#10;2. The game allows for future expansions that will provide more wrestlers! We are planning on calling this first edition the &quot;Red Deck&quot;, and (pending successful funding) we will be coming out with a &quot;Green Deck&quot;. The Green Deck will have all new wrestlers so that you can combine decks and have up to 8 players in a game.&#10;&#10;Alternate Game Modes:&#10;In a standard game of Slamorama each player gets a deck of 13 cards and can have 4 in their hand that they can look at. Each full deck of Slamorama comes with two additional gameplay modes that include the following:&#10;&#10;Full Deck Mode - Where you have all 13 cards in your hand and can look at them. Saves time from having to draw cards. Gives more &quot;tactical advantage&quot;.&#10;&#10;Tag Team Mode - Players choose a partner and play their cards together against opponents to win rounds! They cannot look at or tell each other what they are going to throw down however. Fun with bigger groups!&#10;&#10;Game Contents:&#10;52 cards (13 for each wrestler)&#10;&#10;3 rule cards (each with a unique way of playing the game)&#10;&#10;1 tuck box to hold the cards.&#10;&#10;"

These dice will give you different opportunities like gathering shields and swords, and you will need those if you want to face the dangers between you and the beautiful treasures these islands have to offer! The dice will also let you know the minimum number of dangers you will have to fight to reach the treasures. Each card from the Island deck of cards is either a danger, or an item that you won't be able to get in any other way. If you succeed in beating these dangers, you will get all the treasures! But beware, going by yourself might be very dangerous. Should you invite someone else to go along with you? If so, you have to keep in mind that you won't be able to keep all the treasures for yourself... yes, you will have to share with your lucky partner! Oh, and remember, failing while going through these adventures that await you also means that all your competitors will be able to steal the treasures you put to safety during your run!&#10;&#10;"

When a player can form an integer with the cards in their hand, they play the cards and earn points equal to the integer formed multiplied by the number of cards used.&#10;&#10;The victory point chips show divisions of eighths on them, and players can earn additional points through combining these fractional points into further integers. (e.g. 2 points and 6 points can be viewed as 2/8 and 6/8 and together make 8/8, so an additional point is earned.)  The game ends when the victory chips or cards are gone, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"
