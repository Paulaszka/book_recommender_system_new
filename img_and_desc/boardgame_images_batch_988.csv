Players move their pawns around the track by means of dice rolls or to specific spaces specified by &quot;strategy cards&quot;. Players acquire an estate or property by being the first to land on it. After acquiring an estate or property, they may be able to charge a trespassing fee to players who land on it. Players also acquire Status Symbols and points (money) by landing on any of the eight Status Symbols spaces.&#10;&#10;Players gain or lose points and Strategy Cards or Status Cards as they land on spaces around the track. Any player who cannot pay their debts is eliminated. Once a player has all the requirements for admission to the Blue Book, they proceed to one of four Country Club Lane paths to the center of the board. Once a player is in one of the Country Club Lane paths, they roll the dice to advance. At the last space before the Blue Book, the player rolls one die and specific rolls determine whether they lose a turn, return to their estate, or win the game. A player in Country Club Lane may also be &quot;Blackballed&quot; by another player in which case they return to their estate space on the board.&#10;&#10;"

On their turn, a player may draw one card from their deck, up to a hand limit of five, or play a card to the table.&#10;&#10;Along the bottom of each card is a set of numbers, one for blue and one for red. These say what card can be played after this card. For example, the blue 5 can be followed by a blue 2,3,4 and 6 or by a red 4 or red 6-12.&#10;&#10;As players go through their deck, they must carefully decide which cards to hold and which to play, in order to push more cards out of their opponent's hand.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

You can play it casually (even while drinking beer). The players take turns to place a bottle cap face down on the board. Under each cap, a disk with a faction symbol is attached by magnet. The faction may be that of you or your opponent. Since the bottle caps are placed face down, the players do not know which symbols their opponents have placed. The object of this game is to connect the opposite sides of your color with your symbols. There are two ways to obstruct your opponent's moves. One is to place your symbol on your opponent's route to block it. The other is to &quot;attack&quot;. To attack, choose and reveal 3 facedown bottle caps, and if all three have the same symbols, remove them from the board.
