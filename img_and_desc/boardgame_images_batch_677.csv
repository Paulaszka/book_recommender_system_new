You start each Year by constructing a stone circle of four pairs of standing stones, gariadons, and then use the magic (dice) from those stones to attack your enemies or build up your defenses.  You'll need to pick carefully and roll well, though, to balance aggression and defense, and to do the most damage to your enemies.  Each game Year has four Seasons for a total of 12 turns, and takes approximately 20-30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;Thematic introduction:&#10;King Alwan is dead and the Kingdom of Draig has been torn asunder. Year after year, the dragon-riding knights of King Alwan&rsquo;s former court clash in bloody battle in the skies over Draig. The mystical forces that give dragons flight and imbue magical weapons with astonishing power play a key role in these battles, and woe be to Lords who go into battle without their own cabal of Druids wielding the elements for their army.&#10;&#10;But four times each year, when the seasons are in flux, the world&rsquo;s magic surges, crackling in the air with deadly potential. On these days, the Druids don the mantle of war, calling down torrents of wind and rain, conjuring firestorms that scorch the&#10;land, and shaking the earth itself.&#10;&#10;Stones crack. Mages fall. Kingdoms are lost. And won.&#10;&#10;"

Players collect cards, sabotage opponents, and compete to create roadkill.&#10;&#10;The deck is made up of three kinds of cards: vehicle cards, animal cards, and roadside cards. Players collect vehicle cards and animal cards. If the combination is right, a player will use a vehicle card to run over an animal card and score points.&#10;&#10;Roadside cards provide an element of randomness. Some affect an individual, and some affect the group. Some are beneficial, and some are punishing. Beware of offramps, rush hour, and the police.&#10;&#10;Lastly, players have the option to sabotage their opponent's strategy by attacking, forcing their opponent to discard. Strong animal cards can kill weaker ones, and large vehicle cars can run smaller ones off the road.&#10;&#10;"

Through action selection and dice manipulation, players will plunder, attack, and sail the seas in their quest to bury enough treasure and enjoy a decadent pirate retirement!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Features:Les Petits Pirates is an easy game to expand for more players or larger games.  A single 5.5&rdquo; x 8.5&rdquo; game board can support 2-4 players with 3 ships each.  Multiple game boards can be combined, or a larger board used to easily expand the game for 5-6 players.  Special rules and map also allow for solo play.  More variety can be easily introduced by simply printing new maps that can be used alone or combined with other maps.  The game can easily be re-themed for a variety of genres, like Vikings, Space, High Fantasy, etc.  Les Petits Pirates can easily be played with just the game board and typical household items, like dice and coins, but the game lends itself to having a &lsquo;deluxe&rsquo; edition that includes nicer components.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Overview:Les Petits Pirates is played in two phases per round.  In the first phase all players roll Action dice for their pirate ships and then place them in turn order.  In the second phase each Action die is resolved from the lowest to the highest.  This means that the player order for the second phase changes every round.  Each die provides a choice of Actions, from attacking other pirates to plundering ports to burying gold.  However, players are able to manipulate their dice by spending gold and resources to take their desired action.  The first player to successfully bury twenty gold coins is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Accolades:Les Petits Pirates has been tested at Protospiel and other game design meetups.  Les Petits Pirates won 2nd place in the 2015 MicroGame Print and Play Contest on Board Game Geek.  Les Petits Pirates was a finalist in the KBG Design Contest.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Print &amp; Play:Print &amp; Play files are available in the Web Links section at the official page (at http://georgejaros.com/LPP )&#10;&#10;"

He is stranded on a cliff after all the bridges have collapsed after him. Each player has to find 5 bridge steps among the tokens to build his or her own hanging bridge, and get over the gorge to help Sniff. A lot can happen on the way: one might get caught by the officious Constable, who wants to know who stepped on Hemulen's flowers, bridge steps might fall from a backpack, and the nimble Nibling eats them at once. Luckily Too-Ticky is enjoying the sunny day and if one is lucky he or she might get a lift from Too-Ticky on her hot air balloon. There are also some shortcuts along the way, but it takes a bit of luck to find them. The winner is the player who first completes his hanging bridge and gets to Sniff's rescue.&quot;&#10;&#10;Seikkailu vuorilla (&quot;Adventure in the Mountains&quot;) is a Moomin-themed roll-and-move game for 2-4 players.&#10;&#10;"

This was easy to do since Berlin itself lay deep in the Russian zone. Two million civilians dependent on allied supply watched delivery slow to a trickle. Requiring a daily minimum of 5000 tons of food, fuel, and other necessities, Berliners began dipping into their reserves. American officials estimated they would run out of fuel in 45 days but would run out of food long before that.&#10;The Allies faced a difficult decision. Abandoning the city would be a huge loss of face that could lead to the eventual loss of all of Germany to the communist bloc. On the other hand, with all land routes into Berlin cut the city could only be supplied by air, and was such a thing even possible? The Soviets didn't think so. When the blockade commenced, Americans were only capable of delivering 300 tons of supply a day. Together with the British who could manage 400 daily tons. Officials admitted the tonnage still fell woefully short.&#10;&#10;Supplying a major city by air for an indefinite amount of time? Nothing approaching it had ever been attempted. Despite the overwhelming odds, the Allies determined to give it a go. Veteran pilots and aircrews were recalled as disbanded cargo units were refitted and flown back to Europe. The effort was massive... no, it was beyond massive, nevertheless, Stalin was certain the operation would fail. His determined opponents proved him wrong. This Herculean effort is remembered as the West's most selfless accomplishment.&#10;&#10;Over the course of 12 months the airlift provided 2,225,510 tons of cargo for the city's survival. At one point an airlift plane was lifting off every four minutes. In the end, more supply was provided to Berlin by air than could have been provided by rail. The Soviets did not stand passively by. There were 726 recorded instances of Soviet harassment involving everything from aerial buzzing, and ground fire to rockets, chemicals, smoke and balloons. In the course of the airlift 25 aircraft were lost, costing the lives of over 100 American, British and German personnel. And during the course of the airlift, many curious and heartwarming incidents enhanced the legend of their effort, including the candy bomber, the tour of Clarence the camel and the Easter Parade.&#10;&#10;The Berlin Airlift is a historical treasure begging to be gamed and here we attempt to fit the bill. But a game is only as enjoyable as the conflict it portrays. The game pits players against each other in a race against the clock. Can players overcome accidents, miscommunication and soviet interference to achieve their goals? Who can deliver the most tonnage, and will it be enough for Berliners to survive? Naturally, Berlin Airlift is only representative of the larger enterprise, but in it, players will enjoy tense competition as they face all of the elements these brave allied aircrews faced when the war ended and - the blockade began.&#10;&#10;Players will command either a British or American air squadron. Each squadron consists of up to three flights depending upon the number of people playing. Each flight contains from 3 to 5 period aircraft depending upon the scenario and the faction being played. Individual planes have a rated capacity and in some cases are restricted to carrying fuel. The object for each player is to attempt to carry his squadron's tonnage goals in fuel, food, medicine and spare parts into the city and carry refugees and finished products out (cargo is represented by colored cubes). Each turn the ACTIVE player rolls two dice, consults either the Personality chart, the Help &amp; Hindrance or the Soviet Harassment Chart to determine effects, then begins drawing flight chits to determine who moves when. Strategy enters into the Active player's assignment of problems, decision making as to what to carry and who to fix, what base to return to and how to block opponents from reaching their goals. Oh, but players must be careful, for there is a cooperative aspect to the game. Players have to keep up the Berliner Morale for if it remains in the negative range after the final flight has delivered its cargo Berlin loses and so do all players.&#10;&#10;"

Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.&#10;&#10;The Bloody Inn is a card game in which you play one member of a family of greedy, murderous innkeepers. At the start of each round, cards are placed face up to fill the inn with guests. Each card carries a cost representing how many cards a player must discard from her hand in order to take an action related to that card. Certain guests have an affinity for particular actions, so those cards return to a player's hand after being discarded. Cards also show how much money, in francs, each guest possesses. A round has two phases in which players take one action each, in turn order. Players choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;     bribe a guest into becoming an accomplice (take a card from the inn to their hand)&#10;     build an annex (move a card from their hand to their player area; it now represents a structure under which a victim may be buried)&#10;     kill a guest (move a card from the inn to their player area, awaiting burial)&#10;     bury a victim (place an unburied victim card under an annex card and take the money from the victim's pockets)&#10;     launder money (players may only have a certain amount of cash on hand; excess must be converted to 10F checks by the local notary)&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, if any room of the inn contains one of the police, then they conduct an investigation; if a player has any unburied victims, then he must pay 10F per victim to the local gravedigger to hurredly &mdash; and quietly &mdash; bury the bodies!

180596,,"Moneyball combines euro-style mechanics and the latest in advanced analytics (Sabermetrics) to build a true 21st century tabletop baseball simulation. Moneyball plays faster, smoother, and more accurately than anything before it. Player cards are not jammed with complicated and unsightly dice tables, just 5 straightforward 1-10 ratings for hitters (Contact, Patience, Power, Bunting, Baserunning) and pitchers (Control, Velocity, Repertoire, Move, and Stamina). There are no dice rolls with multiples charts to reference, just a simple card draw for the pitcher and chit draw for the batter.&#10;&#10;Run your front office like a real front office by evaluating talent using the same metrics actual scouts and GMs use today. Not the stats of yesteryear. With advanced Sabermetrics, we've learned there are just a handful of underlying statistics that determine a player's performance. For pitchers the only stats that really matter are his walk, strikeout and fly ball rate. It&rsquo;s been statistically proven that a pitcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; has very little influence on the outcome once a ball is a play. It&rsquo;s much more dependent on the stadium, weather, the defense behind him, and pure luck &ndash; all factors beyond his control. For hitters, strike out and line drive rates, more than anything, determine their batting average. Moneyball has been built from the ground up using these underlying principles.&#10;&#10;Pitchers are streakier than hitters and are therefore modeled differently in Moneyball. Their performance is highly volatile and can vary greatly from game to game because your starting pitcher&rsquo;s draw deck is constructed before each game. The pitcher deck, which determines strike outs, walks, and home runs consists of 108 cards. Your starter&rsquo;s deck has only 36 of those cards and it is typically reshuffled several times each start. One of your roles as the manager is to evaluate his &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; as the game progresses. This creates fantastic &ldquo;heat of the moment&rdquo; decision making that does not exist in other baseball sims. If your starter is wilder than usual or has served up several gopher balls, it&rsquo;s probably because he didn&rsquo;t have his best &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; i.e. his draw deck has more walk and home run cards than usual. So recognizing when your starter doesn&rsquo;t have his best stuff and yanking him is CRUCIAL to your success as a manager. Starters in Moneyball are not purely random dice rolls with a backwards cause-and-effect &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo; modifier added after they&rsquo;ve already gotten lit up. Manage your starting pitcher like a real manager, not a dice roller&hellip;&#10;&#10;"

However, you can also bluff about having those combinations and hope that others will not call on you. At the end the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each player has three dice, a shield and tokens for marking. There are several combination cards in the middle of the table as well as three common dice that will be used by all players. In each round the starting player rolls the middle dice and then all players also have up to three rolls for their own dice, which are rolled behind player's shield. However, if you want to make a roll after your first one, you have to set one die aside, visible to other players. However, if you roll three times your last roll must remain behind the shield - thus each player will have at least one die that is not visible to others.&#10;&#10;When everyone is done with rolling, all players claim, which of the visible combinations they have. The trick is - you can also lie and try to claim a combination, which you don't have. When a player has claimed a combination then all other players in clockwise order have a chance to either accuse him of lying or pass.&#10;&#10;1) If everyone passes then the player scores this combination and receives the points it provides. If he lied and didn't have this combination he can now reveal this fact to others - he still scores the combination as if he had it and he also receives one Successful Liar's card, which gives extra points.&#10;&#10;2) If anyone accuses the player of lying, then he has to reveal his dice, which creates two possibilities:&#10;&#10;If he was not lying then he scores the combination, but the player who accused him takes a False Accusation card, which gives minus points. However, if he was lying then he was accused correctly and doesn't get to score the combination, effectively losing his turn. The accuser doesn't get anything apart from the good feeling that he didn't let the lie slip through.&#10;&#10;Thus each player in a round claims one combination. At the end of the round you add a new combination card from the draw pile and begin a new round. After certain number of rounds you tally up the score and the winner is the player with most points.&#10;&#10;"

For three players each plays one of the three letters.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: On each turn, players write one of each letter into any empty cell on the board (the center is not a playable cell). When the board fills up then the scoring begins.&#10;&#10;Scoring: Palindromes are checked along the horizontal and vertical axes.  For each palindrome containing your letter, score points equal to the palindrome's size minus the number of opponent letters therein. The neutral letter 'N' (2p only) is not considered an opponent letter. In addition, palindromes may also contain sub-palindromes that are scored separately.&#10;&#10;Examples: The palindrome QAQ for the Q-player is worth 2pts. However, the palindrome QNQ is worth 3pts. The player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;The palindrome QQQQ is worth 4-points, but also contains sub palindromes QQQ, QQQ, QQ, QQ, and QQ, making it worth a total of 16-points.&#10;&#10;"

Each card depicts a unique hazard and a hazard rating. Players then take turns moving the card around the table using &quot;Side-Effects&quot; on the cards in their hands.&#10;&#10;If a player is caught without a useable side-effect, that player has to roll a die and try to beat the hazard rating on the card. Side-effects can also help add to your die roll, or, take away from an opponent's die roll. If the hazard is not avoided by rolling higher than the hazard rating, that player recieves a death. 10 deaths to any one player ends the game and the player with the least amount of deaths wins!&#10;&#10;Special Death cards are also included in the deck and pop up at random times to deal out an instant death or two to the active player, a random player, and sometimes, a player of your choosing.&#10;&#10;Don't Die! also has multiple ways to play and encourages coming up with new ways to win.&#10;&#10;"

The spies are hidden on the indexed underworld turntable below the playing surface. In turn, Agents make secret investigations with the DetectiMeter, which will register the presence of a hidden spy.  Using these readings, each Agent marks his own findings on the plastic plotting chart in his notebook.  Players send their turns by reindexing the turntable, which changes the locations of the spies.  All Agents must adjust their notebooks accordingly, in order to &quot;shadow&quot; the spies as they move about in the underworld.  When an Agent can arrest a spy in the act of committing espionage, he uses the Limousine to pick up the spy and drive him out of hiding. The Agent is rewarded with the point value assigned to the crime where he made his arrest.  When all seven spies have been captured, the Agent with the most points is THE WINNER.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game makes extensive use of magnets.  The spy disks contain magnets, and the Detectimeter detects their presence.  The Limousine, which is played on the upper board, has a magnet with which it picks up a spy below the board.  When the Limousine is brought back to the Agents home base, the spy disk falls out of an opening under the upper board.  Cool game!&#10;&#10;"

Unfortunately you can't do this alone, and you need the help of the other magazines, but they are interested only in launching the models in their portfolio. Can you trick the other magazines in covering the models that help you achieve your goal and crush their dreams to become the most prestigious magazine?&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game is played in seasons. Each three months make one complete season, and after each season, a season special is published with your top model. To select a model, a player always has a selection of possible models available (his portfolio). Based on the selections of the different magazines you influence the public and determine the trends for the season. By anticipating the selections of your opponents and selecting the right model for your own magazine you can try to put a model on one of your covers that is completely in line with all trends so it can be your star in the season special. If you manage to do this, you keep the model in your score pile and you score points. If you haven't managed to cover such a model, you don't score points this round unless you managed to put three models on the cover that don't have anything in common with the fashion trends. If you manage to have such alternative models you can score multiple models, but this isn't easy to achieve.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately it is impossible to keep your star models as they will look for other opportunities, so during the game you will see many models leave and the selection of new models is also a key aspect of the game.&#10;&#10;After three years (12 seasons/rounds), the game ends. You count the points of the models you scored during the game. Not all models have the same point value. The later the model enters the game the more points she's worth, because such a model is more difficult to score.&#10;&#10;The game features 162 unique highly detailed models, a catwalk with public that also serves as a storage solution, a scoreboard and markers to achieve a realistic gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Who'll be the star on your cover?&#10;&#10;"
