All our cargo was thrown overboard, and now we must save that precious cargo &mdash; as well as our captain! &mdash; and escape from the raging gigantic octopus from the deep.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Crash Octopus, players race to collect cargo that's floating in the ocean, while surrounded by a horrifically giant octopus. The first player who collects all five types of cargo on their ship wins.&#10;&#10;The game is played by using the table as the landscape, with a string perimeter around the playing area. To set up, place the octopus head at the center of the playing area, surrounded by the tentacles spread out at an equal distance, then the player ships and anchors outside of the tentacles near the perimeter. Finally, you drop all the cargo onto the playing area by bouncing it off the octopus' head.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player uses their flag to either navigate &mdash; by flicking the anchor next to their ship, then moving their ship to touch the anchor &mdash; or flick cargo. Cargo comes in five types &mdash; goblet, chest, gem, gold, and captain (yes, really!) &mdash; and you can flick any type of cargo that's not on your ship toward your ship. The only exception is that you can't flick the single cargo item closest to your ship. If the flicked cargo misses your ship, your turn ends; if it hits your ship, you load that cargo, then advance the cargo tracker, which is a string of beads on the perimeter.&#10;&#10;If you advance a black bead on the cargo tracker, the octopus attacks! Each player takes a turn dropping a die and bouncing it off the octopus' head, possibly moving the head or a tentacle to get in the way of others picking up cargo and possibly knocking cargo off a ship. What a setback!&#10;&#10;"

The games end when the last objective is triggered, or a player reaches 7 points.&#10;&#10;Movement is tight, requiring you to second guess your opponents plan. Timing is crucial, triggering objective scoring only when it benefits you. Like a sparring match, every move should be chosen with precision and efficiency, or your opponent will strike.&#10;&#10;"

The dice have 1-3 stars on three of the sides and the numbers 4-6 on the other three sides. Each other player then secretly selects a color, whether the color they think you'll choose or the color they themselves are interested in. You then name one of the colors, and if anyone else has selected that color, they reveal this information. If the matching die shows stars, they move their seer figure on the scoring track this many spaces, and if it shows a number, they take a card of this color. You either take the die (if it shows stars) or the card, placing this object in your &quot;area of uncertainty&quot;. You then continue your turn by naming another color or end your turn.&#10;&#10;If no one choose your named color, then you pick either the die or card of this color, placing the object in your area of uncertainty. If you took a card when the die showed stars or took a die with a number, then you must continue your turn; otherwise, you can choose to continue or end your turn.&#10;&#10;If all other players have revealed their color choices, then you lose everything in your area of uncertainty, receiving only a bowl card as consolation. If you end your turn &mdash; whether voluntarily or after successfully choosing four of the five colors &mdash; then you move all the cards to your oracle board and advance your seer a number of spaces equal to the sum of all the dice.&#10;&#10;Players take turns in this manner until the first player reaches 30 VPs. Only then are the victory points on the cards counted as well &mdash; but the player who has collected the fewest cards of any particular sort won't get to count the neighboring kind of cards at all.

All players try to build castles on land they claim, and the game ends when someone has built four of them. Castles of different sizes score differently, and the winner is the player with the highest total score. Often the winner is the player with four castles, but not always.&#10;&#10;The game is played with cards, where each card shows a land symbol matching a space on the board. Further some of the cards show a sword that can be used for attacking castles, some show a shield that can be used for defending the same castles, and some show both a sword and a shield symbol. The players only hold five cards each, so hand management is required.&#10;&#10;The game play can be divided into two parts: the peaceful claiming of land and building of castles, and the aggressive conquering of castles built by the opponents. The claiming is very straightforward: at any point in the game, four separate castle patterns are available. On your turn, play a card from your hand and claim a matching space on the game board. You try to claim spaces that create the available patterns. As soon as one of the patterns is built, the player can place a castle tile over those spaces. By claiming spaces next to an opponent's castle tile, you open the possibility of attacking it for yourself. To attack a castle you also play one or more cards from your hand. But now the only thing that matters is whether the cards you hold show the attacker's sword symbol or not. Play and discard as many sword cards as you want, and hope the defender is not holding enough shields to stop your attack. If the attack is successful, the castle's ownership changes. May the most cunning clan chief win!&#10;&#10;"

Nice that you have taken an interest in wargaming. These rules have been developed for people who have no previous experience in wargaming, yet like to play games. BelloLudi designed these rules especially for teambuilding purposes. During our sessions we received feedback that people liked our game, but it was initially too complicated. Now, we have a ruleset of eleven pages, no more than the game of RISK. From page thirteen on, we included some extra rules. You will not be needing them at first, but we can imagine that you would like some variations as your experience grows. Start with that page when you have some battles under your belt.&#10;&#10;The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players. The same goes for the number of miniatures involved. We have collected huge armies over the years but, as you are new to the game, you&rsquo;ll probably do not. Do not fear! The army structure that is presented in this writing, can be easily adapted to the number of miniatures that you have available. Albeit that a large army look suitably impressive. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies.&#10;&#10;This rules-set simulates battles in the period of 1700 to 1900, the age which historians call the long 19th century. Units were drawn up in line in order to maximise the effect of their weaponry. The musket, the type of gun that the troops were supplied with, was only accurate on short distances. During a volley all muskets were fired simultaneously at the same target. Off course, this required iron discipline of the men. Soldiers of that age were drilled to fight formed up into line formation and to march in columns. During the game, your troops will do likewise.&#10;&#10;In an ideal scenario the enemy was pinned in place by fire of artillery, the threat of cavalry or the fire of infantry. Once the enemy was pinned, other units could deliver the coup de grace. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage, indicated by chips, that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry charges and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades and as such, the whole army.&#10;&#10;Your role will be that of a brigadier in a nineteenth century army. Should more players be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
