Tales describe the land as an idyllic paradise filled with marvelous dragon-made wonders and surrounded by a flourishing wilderness. The only portal to that world is the Wonder Book, an ancient tome locked away in an abandoned tower. It sleeps, covered in dust, awaiting the one thing it desires most: you.&#10;&#10;Wonder Book is a pop-up game for 1-4 players in which each player takes the role of a teenage kid in a group of adventurous friends. This is a co-operative game in which you all win or lose as a team.&#10;&#10;The game is split into six consecutive scenarios (&quot;chapters&quot;), each composed of a specific deck of pre-sorted cards that contain the rules, the story, and the challenges you have to face. Each chapter has you explore a new part of the interactive 3D cardboard pop-up book and reveals more about the world in which your adventure is set.&#10;&#10;Starting with the first card of the chapter deck, the story unfolds until you reach a goal card. These cards show a goal that must be achieved to proceed and explain how the players' and enemies' turns take place. Each hero can perform three actions per turn, including moving and fighting, using their individual skills, collecting sparks of magic (used to perform special actions), and interacting with cards and pop-ups. Once all heroes have taken their turn, a Wyrm card determines how the enemies will respond by moving, attacking, spawning, or doing something unexpected.&#10;&#10;The basic mechanisms are easy to grasp, but the game keeps changing as each scenario offers different things to do. You will find yourself exploring, fighting bosses, solving riddles, playing little minigames, looking for clues...anything is possible during the story!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player represents one of the Mining Corporations that has managed to obtain a concession of exploitation in Khurland, south of Ariadnan territory. The goal of these Corporations is to obtain as much Neomaterial as possible, whether it is Teseum or the prized T-Bezoar, and they will stop at nothing to get it. These mining operations are no easy task and not just because of Khurland&rsquo;s hostile environment or the possibility of bumping into a MegaBeast, the greatest danger lies in the Corporations&rsquo; own greed that players will face in lethal combats and raids.&#10;&#10;Tactical Armored Gear, commonly known as TAGs, are single-manned armored weapon platforms that have a broader range of maneuverability and mobility than the human body. They are smaller than light armored vehicles designed for infantry support, and almost as fast-moving. Deep in the inhospitable and unexplored southern territory of the Ariadnan continent lies Khurland. It is here where mining companies use modified TAGs for prospecting tasks in the search for precious Teseum. However, they are still TAGs, and they will always be ready to fight. Be it with another TAG that crosses their path or a dangerous Megabeast that wanders into their territory.&#10;&#10;Each Mining Corporation will have full control of a Prospecting Crew. This team of workers will be made up of one TAG and up to two other Miners from the Corporation like the Prospectors and the Remotes. Together they compete against other teams to obtain as much Teseum and T-Bezoar as possible.&#10;&#10;A TAG Raid match finishes when no more Event cards can be drawn. When the Game Round in which the last Event card was drawn ends, players will compare how many Neomaterial Units they have (Teseum and T-Bezoar); the player with the most Neomaterial Units wins the match. Some Campaign scenario may modify this victory condition.&#10;&#10;"

As the last field battle of that campaign, however, it deserves closer study. Volume 10 in GMT&rsquo;s award-winning Battles of the American Revolution series by designer Mark Miklos provides such a much-needed analysis.&#10;&#10;The game includes three scenarios: the historical fight for Chatterton Hill, an October 31 scenario that explores what might have occurred if Howe had pressed his grand assault that day as planned, and a full four-day campaign game spanning 42 game turns beginning with the arrival of the British army on the field on the morning of October 28 and culminating at 5:00 pm on October 31.&#10;&#10;Each player has 26 Opportunity Cards subdivided into three decks to enhance play and add elements of variability and historical flavor. As with previous games in the series, some special rules represent the unique circumstances of this battle. Among these are rules governing American sortie restrictions and tactical doctrine, rain game turns, restoring army morale, scorched earth, and additional handicaps for American militia, American fieldwork construction, and an off-board movement mechanism for Tarrytown on the Hudson River, seven miles away where British ships lay at anchor. Even Washington&rsquo;s own combat prowess at this early stage of the war is randomized.&#10;&#10;In Volume 10 of the Battles of the American Revolution series, players command two titanic armies: Washington, desperate to salvage something from the otherwise disastrous defense of New York, and Howe seeking a coup de gr&acirc;ce against the &ldquo;Old Fox.&rdquo; You will have to manage your forces over the span of four days with lots of inclement weather to contend with. Can you, as General Howe, break through the American line to deliver a decisive blow and end the rebellion? Can you, as General Washington, hold your own on superior ground, hampered as you will be with some 6,700 militia of dubious quality&mdash;fully 46% of the total American force?&#10;&#10;"

They wandered aimlessly in need of a true leader to guide them. Are you the king who will lead them the way? Do you have a strategy to acquire their trust, and are you cunning enough to challenge other would-be kings? They cannot be trusted as they will do anything to claim the crown you deserve. No sacrifice is too big or small for them. They may think being king is as easy as summoning subjects to their side, squeezing the gold from their pockets through taxes, and arranging some marriages, but only a true king will be able to keep up the morale and lead the inhabitants through the ever-changing circumstances in the valley and the hills.&#10;&#10;In King of the Valley, you must obtain the highest reputation of all the kingly contenders, with reputation being determined by influence, bonuses, and gold. To set up, lay out 25 of the character tiles from age I in a 5x5 grid, with each king starting on a different tile and with 2 gold in their reserve.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can first choose to acquire a tile from the &quot;hill&quot; for the listed gold price; the hill has two columns of six characters, with the characters costing 2-10 gold based on their height on the hill. When you acquire a tile, add it to your personal castle board. Characters have 0-5 influence, with the 1-5 influence characters being sorted by type and with the 0-value jester standing in for a character of your choice (but still being worth 0 influence). You then move your king orthogonally or diagonally, stopping on the character tile you want to claim; alternatively, you can move across 2-3 identical characters in a line, stopping on the space after them in order to collect them all! Add these character tile(s) to your castle board, and if you now have face-up characters with influence from 1-5, you can turn them face down to claim a kingdom bonus of points and coins.&#10;&#10;To end your turn, refill empty spaces in the grid by choosing one column of the hill, then drawing characters from it as needed to fill empty spaces. Finally, draw character tiles from the stack to refill the hill, thereby giving everyone a glimpse at what can come on the playing area in the future, not to mention what can be acquired if you have enough coins in hand.&#10;&#10;Specialist characters show up on the board &mdash; the priest, the wizard, and the tax collector &mdash; with you receiving immediate bonus actions should you collect them.&#10;&#10;When the hill can't be fill completely, the game ends. All characters in your collection add their influence points to your score. Collecting 3-5 knights in the same order grants you bonus points, as does each pairing of a farmer with a farmer's wife.

The steamship SS Atlantica is two days out from port on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.&#10;&#10;Lurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.&#10;&#10;If you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes. Everyone shares the same resource pool, but humans will try to preserve them while traitors will strive to subtly deplete them. Being able to tell when someone is purposefully draining the group's resources is harder than you think, especially when you take crises into account!&#10;&#10;At the end of each player's turn, that player must draw a mythos card. Each of these cards represents a crisis that the whole group must try to resolve together. Some of these crises, such as &quot;Food Rationing&quot;, call for a choice that could potentially put the ship's passengers or resources at risk, while others, such as &quot;Hull Leak&quot;, call for a skill test in which failure could have disastrous consequences.&#10;&#10;During a skill test, each player contributes skill cards from their hand to a face-down pile shared by the group. Once everyone has contributed (or chosen not to), the cards are shuffled, then revealed. If enough of the correct skills were contributed, then the group passes the test! But if the wrong skills were contributed, they can actually hinder the results, leading to failure. Thus, skill tests are dangerous opportunities for traitors to sabotage the humans' efforts, so you have to stay on your toes at all times.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

More troops on the field might amplify your battle presence, but holding onto cards can increase your available actions. Success hinges on strategic foresight and timely decisions.&#10;&#10;With its initial release, Astraea: The Seraphim Paradox provides an ever-rich tapestry of lore and strategy, featuring five distinct factions. The &quot;Shields of Genmar&quot; stand as the stalwart defenders of the capital city's ideals, ever-ready to lay down their lives for the realm. Opposing them are &quot;The Risen,&quot; Genmarian rebels who've embraced forbidden magics to challenge the very fabric of their world. Meanwhile, the &quot;Seraphim Kestral's,&quot; sky-toned enigmas from beyond, bring with them a paradox that not only fractured the realm but thrust them into this relentless war. New contenders await your discovery... Choose your allegiance, and let the battle to restore Astraea begin!&#10;&#10;"
