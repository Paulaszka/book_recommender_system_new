On each turn, you will have an amount of energy (action points) that you can use to maneuver and move your ship around the board.  However, any leftover energy is converted in cargo cards, that you draw into hand.  Asteroids will then semi-randomly move around the board, blocking your way or revealing your hiding space.  Then, the aliens will move and attempt to destroy you.  Each time you get hit by an alien you will have to lose cargo cards- or else you will have to start your smuggling run again.  Upon a successful run, you will score notoriety points based on the cargo you brought and can spend it to increase your maximum energy, maximum cargo (hand size), and number of special powers (mods), or to buy new mods.&#10;The most notorious smuggler at the end of 10 rounds is the winner!&#10;&#10;"
