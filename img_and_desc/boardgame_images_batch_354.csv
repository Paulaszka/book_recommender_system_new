Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition &ndash; Bite Size is intended as a portable travel game. The game is packaged in a wedge (&quot;piece-of-pie&quot;) shaped box.&#10;&#10;The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the colour coded die, and answers a question matching the colour rolled. The colours correspond to categories that include geography, entertainment, history, arts &amp; literature, science &amp; nature, and sports &amp; leisure. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next players turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.&#10;&#10;"

Players score colored markers by placing cards next to each other on the grid in such a way that one or more of the dots on their card line up with similar dots on other cards. For each dot that matches, that player scores a colored scoring marker for the card that their dots matched (not the card they just played).&#10;&#10;During scoring sessions, scoring markers are converted into point chips depending on the current layout of the 3x3 grid. Once a scorecard is drawn, play immediately pauses and scoring begins. Of the 4 types available, the one that is represented the least among the 9 currently on the 3x3 grid is worth the most. This means that each colored score marker of that type that a player has may be converted into a 2-point chip. The most abundant type represented on the 3x3 grid is worth negative 1 point. All other types are worth 1 point. Players may never have a negative total. If there are 2 or more types that are both the least represented type, they are both worth 2 points, likewise, if there are 2 or more types that are tied for being the most represented type, each of them are then worth negative 1 point.&#10;&#10;After scoring has completed, play resumes where it left off and the game continues until the next scorecard is drawn or the draw deck is exhausted. Once the draw deck is exhausted the third and final scoring round takes place. Players then total all of their scoring chips. The player with the highest value wins!&#10;&#10;"

A d6 and a d100 is rolled for each side.  The d6 determines how many officers(state) or leaders(guerrillas) are present; the d100 result is the number of troops.  The two rolls together determine the force's mission.&#10;&#10;For example, a roll of 3/13 gives the state forces one major, two captains, 3 lieutenants and 13 troops.   Their mission reads, &quot;You have captured one important guerrilla leader and must escort him, alive, from one corner of the table to the opposite for a show trial. Convoy.&quot;  A roll of 6/50 gives the guerrilla forces 6 leaders (and, as a 6 was rolled, one of them must be secretly designated the chief leader of the war) and 50 troops.  Their mission reads, &quot;Funeral of a fighter, now a martyr, being used to whip up support.  The three most senior leaders are at the graveside with both parents of the victim.  Next the enthusiastic fighters form a ring, surrounded by the reliable and unreliable fighters mixed, who are in turn surrounded by the fanatics and remaining leaders. Company.&quot;&#10;&#10;The way in which troops are deployed on the board is determined by cross-indexing the mission type of each side on a table.  In the above example, the state's mission type is &quot;convoy&quot; and the guerrillas' is &quot;company,&quot; which gives &quot;deploy company first then start convoy.&quot;&#10;&#10;A d10 is rolled to determine the location, which can range from &quot;Steep hill country&quot; or &quot;dense woodland&quot; to &quot;city back streets&quot; or &quot;market town, market day, very crowded.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

The game dates to the 15th century and is based on earlier large board shogi games. Before the discovery of Taikyoku Shogi in 1997, Tai Shogi was believed to be the largest playable chess variant, if not board game, ever. One game may be played over several long sessions and require each player to make over a thousand moves. It was never a popular game; indeed, a single production of half a dozen game sets in the early 17th century was a notable event.&#10;&#10;Like other large-board variants, but unlike standard Shogi, the game is played without drops, and uses a promotion-by-capture rule.&#10;&#10;Tai Shogi is a gargantuan of a game both in terms of strategy and playing time. A serious game of Tai will require several long sessions to complete and may need over 1000 -moves per player. The game is simply too big to be played strategically, and therefore the game typically proceeds as a series of local skirmishes as both players try to develop their pieces and improve their position. Flat out rapid play will typically take at least three days (takes an hour or so to setup!).&#10;&#10;While most of the 101 different pieces in Tai Shogi are also found in other variants, one unique feature of Tai is the presence right from the beginning of the game of the all powerful Emperors.&#10;&#10;Tai Shogi is played on a board of 25 x 25 squares and each player has 177 pieces (including 25 pawns) ! A unique feature of Tai Shogi is the presence right from the start of the game of the all powerful Emperors. The Emperor has the greatest power of any piece in any of the Shogi variants as it may move in one turn to almost any square on the board, jumping over any number of pieces of either side in the process.&#10;&#10;While you might think that the power of the Emperors would have a great impact on the course of the game, their powers tend to offset each other. It should be noted that any otherwise unprotected piece is always protected by its own Emperor.&#10;&#10;"

I know little about the game except that I did see an artist's rendition of the game being played in the book &quot;SAFE RETURN DOUBTFUL - The Heroic Age of Polar Exploration&quot; written by John Maxtone-Graham. The game is about racing sleighs to the south pole and uses pencils to map out the route. From page 259 of the book. &quot;The game was played on a large circular papier-mache board, painted white and grooved with concentric ridges of miniature sastrugi   (SASTRUGI = Wind eroded snow, which often looks rough, like frozen waves. Usually found on windward slopes). Each player assumed the identity of a famous explorer and, equipped with special magnetic pencils, coaxed miniature sledges through the maze of tracks toward the central pole, False leads led to dead ends, and any player thus stymied could extricate his sled only by using a magnet of reversed polarity marked &quot;Dr. Cook&quot;&quot;&#10;&#10;"

To start the game, a sheep is drawn on the page, preferably in the middle, then one person decides to go first and draw something on the page. Remember, the sheep is trying to escape the traps of the killer while the killer is trying to kill the sheep.

In the role of Knights the players have to search for the imprisoned Queen of England and return her to her beloved husband, the grieving King. An original game after an original novel.&#10;&#10;In this game the game board is constructed from tiles (initially put face-down) and is revealed throughout the game as Knights move on the tiles. Each tile is divided into 9 segments which are used for the movement and there are 3 Terrain types to be found - Roads, Forests, and Mountains. Each Terrain allows for a different Movement speed.&#10;&#10;The Goal of the Knights is to uncover and get to six Castles and find out on which of them the Queen is held (by secretly checking upon a castle card when they enter a Castle, eventually coming to the last card under a small stone, that shows the correct Castle). During their journeys they can use various helpers, for instance Horses, Boats, Eagles or their special versions (awarded from the King for capturing Traitors, that can be found in Taverns).&#10;&#10;All-in-all the concept and production quality of the game is fresh and outstanding and is well worth the moderate-to-low price.&#10;&#10;The game is language independent, only the manual would have to be translated (currently in Czech only, as of February 2009).&#10;&#10;"

Tiles come in five colors numbered 0-10, and when you place the second tile of a color, you lock in whether you're ascending or descending in that color. For example, if you take a blue 2, then a blue 4, you can place only blue 5-10 in the future. Some tiles have a symbol that grant you another turn immediately.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is flipped, the game ends after that player finishes their turn. If you've collected only 1-2 tiles of a color, you lose points; the same applies if you collect fewer than two &quot;wishing stones&quot;, a symbol scattered across multiple colors. Sum your score for all five colors and wishing stones, then add any bonus points on tiles you collected. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

Each player controls one or more of the major powers that presided over European politics in that day. Spain is the juggernaut, able to draw upon the vast riches of their global empire. But such a dominant power is sure to have many enemies. The Ottoman expansion towards Spain's Mediterranean outposts remains unchecked. Elizabeth's English sea dogs are poised to raid Spain's overseas empire. And the forces of Protestant reform will soon drag Spain into eighty years of rebellion in the Netherlands. Will Spain find aid from its Catholic allies? Perhaps not from France, where the Catholic Valois dynasty is soon to engage another group of Protestant believers in the bloody French Wars of Religion. And even Philip's relatives in Vienna who rule the Holy Roman Empire may dabble in the Protestant faith instead of remaining loyal to their Catholic heritage and Spanish brethren.&#10;&#10;The six powers in Virgin Queen are:&#10;&#10;     Ottoman&#10;     Spain&#10;     England&#10;     France&#10;     Holy Roman Empire&#10;     Protestants (Dutch &amp; Huguenots)&#10;&#10;&#10;Virgin Queen: Wars of Religion 1559-1598 is the sequel to Here I Stand, another card-driven game of grand strategy that covered the previous forty years (from Martin Luther's posting of his 95 Theses in 1517 through the abdication of Charles V in 1556). Players familiar with Here I Stand will find much that is familiar in Virgin Queen as over half of the rule book remains unchanged. New game systems have been put in place to emphasize the changing nature of the conflicts here in the late 16th Century:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Religion: Streamlined from Here I Stand, the new rules for religious conversion and rebellion allow actions to be resolved quickly, reflecting the already entrenched presence of both Catholic and Protestant factions across the key areas of religious struggle.&#10;     World Map: Oceanic expeditions are now under direct player control as they sail to the Caribbean and beyond to seize plunder, found colonies, and attempt to circumnavigate the globe.&#10;     Diplomatic Influence: Alliances with minor powers (and major powers that can be activated in games with fewer than six players) are now made through a unified system where players buy influence at each of these foreign courts.&#10;     Weddings: Here I Stand&rsquo;s secret negotiation phase is still present here in Virgin Queen, but with a new twist. Now you will want to arrange marriages for each of the princes and princesses of your family dynasty with a suitable foreign royal. Will even the Virgin Queen succumb to love and take a husband, or will she jilt that suitor at the last minute once again?&#10;     Patronage: Your royal court will be visited by artists, writers, scientists, and architects, who all want you to invest in their endeavors for the glory and advancement of the realm. Will you sponsor Galileo, Cervantes, or Shakespeare or instead spend your treasury on a fruitless quest for the Philosopher's Stone?&#10;     Espionage: Beware, there is also a dark side to this period &ndash; a time of espionage and spymasters. In Virgin Queen you can ask your ambassadors to spy on foreign courts, send out handgun-armed assassins, invest in cryptology, and even recruit Jesuit priests for undercover missions of conversion. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are several different scenarios included allowing your play sessions to be tailored to the number of players and time available:&#10;&#10;     Two-Player Tutorial: Great for new players just learning the series, this 90-minute game pits the Ottomans against Spain during the time of the Siege of Malta and Battle of Lepanto. Uses a subset of the full rules so you can dive in quickly.&#10;     Campaign Scenario: The full Virgin Queen experience, this eight-hour game can last up to seven turns and is normally played with from 4 to six players. Variant rules allow you to play with just two or three players if desired.&#10;     Armada Scenario: A quicker game focused on Turns 3 to 6 of the full campaign, this 4 to 5-hour game is ideal for tournament play. Once again supports from 4 to 6 players.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
