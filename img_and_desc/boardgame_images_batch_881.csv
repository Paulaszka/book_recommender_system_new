He studied art in Munich under Franz von Stuck and Karl J.

That story was Robinson Crusoe. Now this timeless tale is brought to life once more in a dynamic card game, but this time you are the one who needs to survive and make it off the island.    &#10;This ancient tale it&rsquo;s alive again!&#10;&#10;In 1651 a young man leaves home for an adventure at sea. He is shipwrecked on an island, 40 miles out to sea. He spends the next 28 years on this island, gathering food, resources, and tools, and battling against insurmountable odds to stay alive. He hunts, raises animals, reads the bible, and begins to turn his focus and attention inward. He becomes a man of God, and learns to accept his fate, growing spiritually. He realizes that he has everything he needs to survive and live in peace.&#10;&#10;Combining themes of hope, strength, and resiliency, this strategic, multi-layered game will test your skills in more ways than one, as you navigate through cannibal attacks, deadly storms, and your own inner turmoil.&#10;&#10;Robinson Crusoe: Escape from Despair Island is a fast-paced, family-friendly game for 1-4 players, ages 14 and up. Offering a new gameplay experience every time, with vibrant art on 160 cards, push-your-luck mechanics, and the age-old theme of survival and escape, it will leave you wondering if you have what it takes to make it home alive.&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10; The deck is shuffled, and every player is dealt five cards face down. These cards represent the players&rsquo; food supply, with one card being equal to one day's worth of food.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds in a clockwise direction and includes two phases of play during each player&rsquo;s turn - the exploration phase, and the market phase.&#10;&#10;During exploration phase the active player draws cards from the deck in order to take one card either food card or some camp cards to their camp. Market phase opens for other players once the active player has chosen what card to take.&#10;&#10;Pay every turn&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every turn, a player must discard one food card into the discard pile. This is the cost of playing the game and represents one day's food supply being used up.&#10;&#10;Exploration turn&#10;&#10;During exploration turn, players take turns flipping cards to find the resources they need. You can think of each flipped card as a new resource or ability your character has uncovered. A player can flip up to 10 cards. The aim of the exploration phase is to find food and resources and to build the camp and character. Ultimately the goal is to escape from the island.&#10;&#10;After a maximum of ten cards have been flipped, the active player chooses which card they are going to keep, leaving the remaining cards on the table for the other players to buy.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to take cards from the drawn cards&#10;&#10;1) Harvest food cards i.e cards with a green palm tree symbol on the top left and a food icon on the bottom right. When harvesting, take the indicated amount of food from draw deck and place the food card on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;2) Take camp cards such as construction cards with a brown upper left corner symbol on the top left, character cards with a blue upper left corner symbol, or resource cards with upper left corner left green palm tree corner symbol, other than food cards, to your camp if you meet the requirements.&#10;&#10;The camp can consist of items like a hut, palisade, box or boat, as well as resources such as a rifle, an axe or gunpowder. Character growth and actual character cards are also placed in the camp. When a player builds an item in their camp, the card is placed image side up on the table in front of the player.&#10;&#10;A player can continue flipping cards until either:&#10;&#10;a) they have flipped a total of ten cards, in which case the player is forced to decide what card to take, or &#10;b) they decide to stop and take some of the flipped cards to their camp, or alternatively harvest food when the food card is discarded and food cards are taken from the draw deck, or&#10;c) they flip a total of two threat cards which from the player cannot defeat the more difficult one.&#10;&#10;Defeat the threats&#10;&#10;If a second threat card is flipped, the player must then defeat the greater of the two threats (denoted by 1, 2, or 3 skulls in the top right corner of the card) if they want to take some flipped card from the table to the camp.&#10;&#10;The threat is defeated by having the cards listed on the card&rsquo;s &quot;requirement row&quot;. Each card has its own symbol. In the above example player have no any cards in the camp, so the exploration turn is over for that player and player do not get to keep any of the cards they have flipped.&#10;&#10;If the player is able to defeat the threat, the card is placed on the discard pile, and they can either continue the exploration phase and drawing cards, or take the indicated amount of food cards and add them to their pile. The options available after defeating the threat are visible on the bottom of the card where there are card deck icon OR food icon with number.&#10;&#10;Build your camp&#10;&#10;When building the camp by taking a construction unit like a boat using an axe and wood, the wood is discarded (it has the finite symbol '1') while axe is not discarded (it has the infinite symbol &infin;).&#10;&#10;With every draw you risk encountering threats and losing food, but the one thing you need the most could be waiting under the next card. How far will you go to survive?&#10;&#10;There are many decisions to be made:&#10;&#10;1) Stop flipping cards earlier, and minimize the chance for other players to buy the cards they need during the market phase.&#10;2) Keep flipping, and you have a better chance of finding the cards you need, allowing you to gain more food from other players who want to buy these cards from you later. But push your luck too far and you will be defeated by the second threat card, which you cannot defeat. &#10;3) Push for consistent development of your resources and character, or grow your food pile first and purchase more helpful cards later?&#10;4) Grow your food pile aggressively, and risk losing half of them if a bad luck card shows up. &#10;5) Use up your food supplies as you go, and you may find them doubled if a good luck card appears.&#10;&#10;Market phase&#10;&#10;After player has done his exploration turn, the market phase starts. Moving in a clockwise direction, all other players are now given the opportunity to buy any cards that are left from the exploration phase.&#10;&#10;The cost of each card is denoted by a number in the top right corner, which represents the number of food cards the buying player must then discard to acquire the card. On top of this number, the buying player must also give one food card to the selling player.&#10;&#10;If there is no number in the top right corner (as with the goat card) then the buying player does not need to discard any food cards, but they do still need to give the selling player one food card as payment.&#10;&#10;The market phase continues until all the cards have been bought or the players do not want to buy any more. Any cards left on the table at the end of the market phase are then placed in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Grow your character&#10;&#10;It will take more than just food and shelter to keep player alive. Player will need to teach, pray, and read to build up character, and better the odds of escaping alive. By collecting character growth cards, a player can get characters, which give effects and open up paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Victory paths&#10;&#10;a) Beacon Campfire victory path, either with the Man of God character card or with a camp of 18 victory points &#10;b) Escape the Island victory path, either with the Teacher character card or with a camp of 18 victory points &#10;c) Victory point strategy, by having the Wise Man character plus 25/20/17 VPs (4/3/2 players)&#10;&#10;Beacon campfire&#10;&#10;You could draw the attention of a rescue ship, but you will need to become a Man of God OR build a camp with at least 18 VPs and find wood and gunpowder to build a fire.&#10;&#10;Escape from the Island&#10;&#10;You can set your sights on building a boat, but you will need to find Friday and teach him how to help you.&#10;&#10;Victory point&#10;&#10;Finally, you can pray and read to become a wise man and build up your victory points to beat the other players.&#10;&#10;Game ends&#10;&#10;The game ends in either of the following situations:&#10;&#10;a) When the draw deck has been played through twice, in which case the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins&#10;b) When any player achieves one of the three winning strategies: Beacon Campfire, Escape the Island or Victory points.&#10;&#10;Explanation of card types&#10;&#10;Food cards: There are two kind of food cards, regular food cards and food &amp; resource combo cards, such as wood and goat, that player can use either as a food card (harvested like other food cards) or as a resource card (placed in the camp like regular resource cards). These are necessary in order to maintain an adequate food supply.&#10;&#10;Resource cards: Resource cards have two kinds, regular resources like axe and wood, and food &amp; resource combo cards (see above).&#10;&#10;Construction cards: There are two kinds of construction cards, regular ones and combo ones, combo having two construction units in the same card. These cards are important for protecting yourself and also enabling some victory paths.&#10;&#10;Exploration cards allow a player to take extra cards or double the amount of food collected, which boosts the exploration phase significantly.&#10;&#10;Good &amp; Bad luck cards: Good luck cards give 4 food to the player with the least food cards. Bad luck cards force players with more than 6 food to lose half of their food cards. Both of these cards are enforced as soon as they are drawn.&#10;&#10;Character cards: There are two types of character cards, character growth cards and character cards. Growth ones are important prerequisite cards for the actual character cards, Man of God, and Wise man cards. They are necessary not only for protection, but are also requirements for special victory scenarios.&#10;&#10;The special character card Friday helps to protect the player against many threats. It also allows for an additional card to be drawn when exploring, but it also forces you to pay one more food when you buy.&#10;&#10;Victory cards: Cards like Beacon Campfire and Escape the Island are key victory cards.&#10;&#10;Said about the game&#10;&#10;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for something that re-creates the high drama of it&rsquo;s subject matter&hellip;it does a really great job.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ndash; Rahdo&#10;&#10;&ldquo;The design and the art...

Like your brothers and sisters, you will spend a huge part of your life preparing for your journey towards the Afterlife. Getting the support of loyal nobles and talented artisans, building a magnificent burial chamber, making offerings to the Gods&hellip; here are the main tasks set for you. But the gods are looking at you and you will have to do your best in order to satisfy their demands. Each of your actions will be judged during the weighing of your heart.&#10;&#10;Pharaon is a game mixing resource management and worker placement into a single mechanism, thanks to its Wheel of Actions. It is located at the center of the gameboard, surrounded by 5 areas, representing the 5 actions featured in the game. Each round, the Wheel indicates which resource has to be spent for accessing the matching action. As the wheel rotates from one segment by the end of each of the 5 rounds, this access cost to actions fluctuates throughout the game. As a consequence, players have to plan their actions, anticipating which resources they may need for the next round. But there are a limited amount of available spots on the wheel, forcing you to watch your opponents, which resources they have, and what they may intend.&#10;&#10;How to play ?&#10;A game of Pharaon is played in 5 rounds, during which the players take turns one after the other, until everyone has passed. On their turn, a player performs one of the 5 actions on the board. The actions can provide Prestige Points (PP), determining who wins at the end of the game, but they can also help getting new resources for further turns. To be allowed to perform an action, the player has to pay its Access cost, by spending the resource indicated by the Wheel of Actions for the area in which they want to act. They then pay the Action Cost by spending the corresponding resources. The resource spent on the Wheel to access this area gets deducted from the Action Cost, if it can match. So, it is useful to anticipate the rotation of the Wheel for taking the actions at their best cost. But there is a limit on how many times an action can be performed, and your opponents may need the same as you. Moreover, the game will be closely watched by the Gods. You will have to fulfill as many of their demands as possible to get their support and some extra PP.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players start by randomly selecting 5 level cards (this is your cartridge) and inserting them into their Retro Gamer Device. Each level has a predetermined number of turns so players must try and make the best with the options they're presented.&#10;&#10;The goal is to collect points while navigating across levels, moving with the help of shapes chosen from the options rolled on your adventure dice. Points are mainly collected by covering as many empty spaces as possible (venture points); defeating creatures scattered across the levels; and using a key to open the lock. There are also several other ways of accumulating points such as Treasure Cards and Side Quests.&#10;&#10;Items found in a level are collected when covered, adding to your player board or wallet. When covering creatures, players attack by drawing cubes from a bag. Successful attacks earn you points while taking hits will cost you health. Players can press their luck to earn maximum points but risk dying in the process.  If a player does run out of health during an attack, they lose a point as consequence but are revived on their next turn, continuing from where they left off.&#10;&#10;The Treasure Cards that are collected are added to the limited slots on your player board to help you along the way. Their content ranges between Spells, Companions, and Special Items.&#10;&#10;Bombs are a vital part of the game as they enable players to take shortcuts and sometimes access items that are otherwise unavailble. If a player wishes to cover a brick with their chosen shape, they will need to spend a bomb. Bombs (like all items) are either collected or purchased.&#10;&#10;Retro Hero is a truly unique dungeon crawling experience with up to 40 levels to choose from and 11 different shapes to dictate your every move. The player with the most points becomes the Ultimate Retro Hero!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Uncontaminated water on Earth is scarce and so it is the chosen commodity and the benchmark used to evaluate your success in competition with the 5 other Corporations.&#10; Your Earth Corp is sending you, on a yearly basis, a diminishing amount of water from Earth for your use on your satellite. You utilize this water to activate &quot;Squishy&quot; (men) and &quot;Crunchy&quot; (robots) stored on your satellite. You use Squishy and Crunchy to drop down from your satellite to a constantly rotating planet Mars to explore the hidden terrain and discover water resources. Each Squishy that holds a terrain hex at the end of the fiscal year will provide water to send back to Earth in a running tally with the highest total at the end of the game being awarded the Monopoly of Mars for their Corporation.&#10;&#10;Each Fiscal Year is divided into 4 Quarters and a Fiscal Year End. During the turn order players: receive water from Earth and roll for safe transit; active Squishy and Crunchy units; bid on the Chair; resolve storm movement and damage; determine and wait for Mars rotation; move units down to and around on Mars; resolve hex control through conflict; resupply their units on the surface with water from the satellite; accumulate profit points for terrain held; attempt to discover Alien Tech; and generally mess with the competition whenever they can using MarsNeedsYou Cards.&#10;&#10;MarsNeedsYou Cards are held by players and used to benefit themselves or mess with the competition. Players also bid with water for a &quot;Chairmanship&quot; which allows them to roll to determine the amount of rotation of Mars before players are allowed to move their Squishy and Crunchy to the surface. &quot;Chairman&quot; also get to decide which of all the players will go first, with play proceeding in a clockwise order. This allows them to decide where they would like to be in the order of play. Where conflict occurs between multiple players for a terrain hex the &quot;Chairman&quot; also decides who fights first, even if they are involved in the conflict. And speaking of conflict, players who move their units onto other player occupied terrain hex are now in &quot;Strenuous Negotiations&quot; and must roll dice to determine who will hold the terrain and reap the profit from it and who will die and be rendered back into water for collection. If a player is not involved in any conflict they may pay water and roll for the chance to collect an Alien Tech Card which will provide them with an advantage courtesy of found Mars Alien Technology.&#10;&#10;At the end of the last Fiscal Year, players count up their profit and any game bonuses for things like holding specific terrain or having the most Squishy on Mars and see how much total profit they have sent back to Earth.

Players play the role of a warrior that must combine different grips, guards, and blades to create a fantastical weapon!&#10;&#10;Game Prep:&#10;Each player has a space in front of them known as the Forge where they place different card types including blades, grips, guards, shields, and gadgets. Each player starts with an Adventurer blade and wooden grip in their Forge. Each player starts with an attack die (starts at d4) and a health die (d20 set to 20). The Armory (draw pile) is shuffled and 6 cards are dealt to each player. A starting player is chosen.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;The objective of the game is to be the last player standing after all others have been defeated. The goal as the game progresses is to place grips and guard onto your blade in order to Reforge. This allows you to upgrade your attack die (d4-&gt;d6-&gt;d8-&gt;d10-&gt;d12), giving the benefit of more possible damage and allowing you to use more powerful blades (Forge level requirements are marked on cards).&#10;&#10;Attacking is done by selecting a target player and adding up all the attack modifiers (red number) on your blade, grip, and guards. This is your base attack. You then roll your attack die and add it to your base attack to determine the total attack. Subtract your target's defense (blue number) to calculate damage dealt to the target player.&#10;&#10;Blocking can be performed if the defending player has at least one part (guard or grip) in play attached to their blade. To block, both players roll their attack die (blade and part modifiers are ignored). If the defending player rolls higher, they take no damage. If the attacking player rolls equal to or higher, the defending player takes the damage they would have AND discards a part of their choice from their Forge.&#10;&#10;Shields can be placed on a player's turn. If an attack meets or exceeds the shield's stability (marked in the corner of the card), the shield is discarded and the defending player takes no damage (there is no overflow damage to player). If the attack is less than the shield's stability, the player takes no damage and the shield remains. The stability of the shield is reset after each player's turn (it does not decrease like health).&#10;&#10;Turn Flow:&#10;1) Draw a card.&#10;2) Recycle (discard two cards to draw one).&#10;2) Use gadgets (as many as you'd like).&#10;3) Place or replace a part (one per turn).&#10;4) Reforge or attack (you cannot attack if you Reforge).&#10;&#10;When a player's health reaches zero, that player is out.

You can play with cards, blocks, or counters -- the game comes with them all.  The cards/blocks/counters represent the units of the German and Russian armies in 1942 around Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players will move their units, optionally play an event card, and fight battles in an attempt to gain control of the two ferry points and and tank factory.  Each turn you will replace eliminated units using replacement points, but for each unit you bring back one of your &quot;dead pile&quot; units is permanently eliminated.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by the player who controls the ferry points; if each player controls one, then control of the tank factory will determine the ultimate winner.&#10;&#10;Playable by 1 to 2 players in under 1 hour.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players then take it in turns to make two moves each turn.&#10;Individual discs can move one square at a time or two squares with your two moves, either forwards, backwards or sideways and in any combination of these, but no disc can ever be moved diagonally.&#10;Rows of linked discs can be moved together lengthways, like train carriages, one square at a time, which counts as one move, but you can&rsquo;t move rows widthways.&#10;To nudge an opponent&rsquo;s disc, you have to out-number them lengthways &ndash; 2 against 1 and so on.&#10;The game ends when you nudge an opponent&rsquo;s disc off any edge of the board. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Then you rack it up and you play again&#10;&#10;"

The 5th place player does the same.&#10;&#10;The player with the third most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"
