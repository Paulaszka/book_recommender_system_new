The object of the game is to use your cards to create hilarious insults that score damage points that remove the &quot;lives&quot; from your opponents. The last player left with lives wins.&#10;&#10;Each card has two words are phrases on it and an associated point value with each one. Play proceeds clockwise starting with the player left of the dealer.&#10;&#10;Each turn the player can either play an insult on anyone at the table OR exchange any amount of cards from their hand for new cards. An insult is 4 or more cards that when read aloud, form a complete sentence that insults another player. Example:&#10;&#10;YOUR JACKED, BUCK-TOOTHED GRANDFATHER LIKES TO SPOON WITH A NEUROTIC, TINY CHICKEN!&#10;&#10;The player lays down the cards that forms their insult, points to a player they are insulting, and reads the sentence aloud. You imply the punctuation with how you speak the sentence. So say it like you mean it!&#10;&#10;You then total the points on the read side of each card in the insult (upper right corner).&#10;If this total is 5 or more, the insulted player loses 1 life.&#10;If the total is 10 or more, the insulted player loses 2 lives&#10;If the total is 15 or more, the insulted player loses 3 lives, AND the insulting player takes one of the lost lives and adds it to their own lives.&#10;&#10;There are &quot;Reversal&quot; and &quot;Redirect&quot; cards that the insulted player can play to deflect an insult. The insulting player can play a &quot;BOOM&quot; card at the end of their insult to make it unreversable and unredirectable.&#10;&#10;Argle Bargle is a casual game, but it takes more than luck to best your opponents. It requires creativity and strategy.&#10;&#10;There are no dirty or offensive words in this version.&#10;&#10;"

Can you use your wits to deduce who your patron is and elevate him or her to rule the city?&#10;&#10;The Council of Colbridge is based on a unique combination of imperfect information, deduction and constrained action. Each player knows the patron of at least one other player, but not their own. Each turn players select actions (charity, bribery or violence) and how these balance with the previous actions of the other players determines which councillor advances in power. By watching and analysing the actions of others, players may deduce who their patron is and push them to power. But what if someone was bluffing? The resulting atmosphere of calculation and suspicion is reminiscent of a political thriller.&#10;&#10;"

Otherwise the non-spy player with higher victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#172;&#161;&#230;&#156;&#159;&#230;&#142;&#140;&#233;&#150;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#183;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#10;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#156;&#157;&#229;&#187;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#151;&#165;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#228;&#191;&#174;&#231;&#183;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#139;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#164;&#150;&#231;&#149;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#228;&#187;&#182;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#167;&#163;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#10;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#229;&#163;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#144;&#141;&#229;&#163;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#229;&#163;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#142;&#140;&#233;&#150;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#140;2&#228;&#189;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#131;&#133;&#229;&#160;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#157;&#229;&#187;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#172;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Who can buy and sell his products and goods on the domestic market profitably or take in the most on the trading ships? Who can send the right delegate to parliament in order to influence the government legislative process, or erect distilleries, hotels and banks at the right moment to the benefit of his village?&#10;&#10;Whoever has accumulated the most victory points in Cuba by the end of the game wins. Players earn victory points by shipping merchandise from the harbor, but also by erecting and using buildings, and by abiding by the law.&#10;&#10;El Presidente:&#10;&#10;The expansion to be used by 'Cuba'. An additional game board, more and different ship cards, laws, buildings, new character cards to be used with the other characters, and a whole new phenomenon: Cuba - the Arrival of the President!&#10;In their turn, players may take and play a character from the 'El Presidente' board: the worker, dancer, attorney, warden, revolutionary or musician. They all have different effects.&#10;The worker puts your goods into the warehouse; all your goods are safe this turn. The revolutionary gives you one victory point, the musician two money. The player with the dancer card becomes immediately the new start player; the old rule for determining the new start player is no longer in effect.&#10;&#10;With the attorney a player may use a building even when his supervisor is not on the row or column of this building, paying one money. The warden may change two adjacent ships in position. There are two mule cards being used when playing with less than five players; these cards cannot be chosen. When all players have chosen a card, the car of the president moves to the position of the remaining card; remember, there are six cards that each turn are shuffled and randomly placed.&#10;&#10;Under each card on the board are symbols that come into effect when the car of the president stops there. The first makes all law proposals go into effect; the second makes it possible to move the supervisor anywhere on a player board in the next round. The next symbol also is in effect for the next round: it allows you to pay one money and overbuild a building with another; the difference in resources must be paid as well. One symbol makes the leading player to go back two points on the score track; another allows players to purchase market wares at discount prices. Players must now not only consider which role they would like to take, but also which position they likely want to be visited by the president.&#10;&#10;There are 2 additional laws in each of the four categories, so that the game can now last up to 8 rounds instead of just 6.&#10;&#10;"

That of the eighties, that of John Carpenter. You liked it, did not you? Well, look no further. If you want to relive the best moments of the film (if you suffer a horrible death you consider a good time), then The Creature is your game.&#10;&#10;The Creature is a competitive card game in which you will all have to fight against all to escape with life from the scientific base in which you are locked together with an Being from Another World known as The Creature.&#10;&#10;In this hidden role-playing game you will not have friends, because anyone can be infected. The only thing that matters is to survive and to escape in the only available place of the rescue helicopter ... although that supposes to finish with your companions.&#10;&#10;The Creature is a card game for 3 to 10 players in which no one is who they seem to be and where paranoia reigns throughout the game. Use your event cards to beat your teammates, vote against them to sedate them, collect weapons for the final showdown and try to prevent The Creature from taking over your body. Does it feel like little stress? Then wait for the helicopter to land and you have to fight everyone to occupy the only seat.&#10;&#10;A game of The Creature lasts from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;The game is not recommended for children under 13, we do not want children to become accustomed to crushing their friends.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to escape from the research base on the helicopter. The bad thing is that there is only one place for a scientist, so only one of the players can escape the horror. Will it be a human who gets on the helicopter, one of the infected scientists or the creature itself?&#10;&#10;The helicopter will arrive when all the turns of game are finished. There are as many turns in a game as participating players minus one, which are controlled in the time marker with the clock tab. The minimum number of turns to play is 2, and the maximum 10. This represents the difficulty or ease of the creature to infect scientists when the group is more or less numerous.&#10;&#10;It can neutralize the Creature so that it does not continue to infect the scientists, sedating it twice (the first time the silk manages to escape).&#10;&#10;The scientist who escapes in the helicopter wins the game, even if it is the creature or one of the infected will mean the end of humanity ...&#10;&#10;Overview.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into turns, and there are as many turns as players are present in the game minus one (maximum 10 turns), plus the final turn of the game, the helicopter phase where everyone fights against everyone to sit in the available seat and Escape from base. Each turn is divided into three phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Event Phase&#10;     Voting phase&#10;     Movement phase&#10;&#10;&#10;During the events phase players put their event cards into action to produce effects during the game.&#10;&#10;In the voting phase players use their voting to decide which scientist they will sedate.&#10;&#10;The movement phase is played after the voting, and in it all players deliver their character cards (including that of The Creature) to the boss, who shuffles them and re-allocates them among the players, in such a way that the Creature moves from one scientist to another, infecting them.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to escape in the helicopter. Players who have had the creature's card at some point become infected, and therefore will try to help the creature carry out its plans, complicating the existence of other players who are still human. The bad thing is that there will be moments during the game in which no one will know who is who, further sowing chaos in the game.&#10;&#10;"

This is done by constructing equations producing the number to which they wish to move before drawing replacement tiles from the bag to replenish their stock.&#10;&#10;A modular board, an optional dice determining the number of spaces a player may move, and the choice of exponent, allow for a variety of levels of difficulty.

At the start of play, all colors are neutral and do not belong to any player. During the course of the game, both players must choose two colors. The goal is to make piles of five pieces of different colors whose top color is their own.
