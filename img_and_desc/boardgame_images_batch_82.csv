Don&rsquo;t forget to charge up your cannons to shoot down your enemies&rsquo; sails. Galeone Galeotto is a game of luck and memory.&#10;You first have to try and pick up from the table your four pirate cards with different colors, before forming the ship crew.&#10;Pay attention, if you pick up a pirate in a color you already have just put it back on the table... then try and recall where your enemies have put them, one never knows!&#10;Once your crew is recruited, the whole staff is completed and you can start firing at the enemies&rsquo; galleons. You pick up cannon cards that allow you allow to hit other sails with a given color: the yellow cannon hits a yellow sail, the green cannon a green sail...&#10;Yet you have to set the strategy and decide which galleon you want to shoot at.&#10;Sail before the wind and... fire!&#10;&#10;Available as pdf download on the Kidultgames Homepage.&#10;&#10;"

There is even a Reduced copy of the Game map if players should feel the need for using one.The cardboard Game Counters are Dark PINK with BLACK &amp; WHITE print for the Soviets, and Light GRAY, GRAY, Light PURPLE, and BLACK with WHITE &amp; BLACK print for the Germans using mostly NATO style symbols &amp; a few silhouettes for Type designations with some Informational markers also provided. The Errata sheet has some misprinted Counters information, Tiger Battalions Breakdown &amp; Jammed Rules, Set-up clarifications, and the Terrain Effects on Combat table.&#10;&#10;The 3 Scenarios are: (1)Operation:WINTER TEMPEST-an Historical depiction with up to 6 Variants; (2)Manstein's WISH:the Early Attack; &amp; (3)The Maximum Effort. The SCALE of the Game is given as (4)-Miles across for each HEX, each TURN equals (1)-Day, and Units are Battalion to Divisional level with Headquarters for Division to Army level. The Sequence of Play is as follows: 1.Mutual Supply Determination Phase plus possible Mud Conditions die-roll; 2.German AIR Phase; 3.German Movement; 4.German Combat; 5.German 2nd Movement; 6.German Special(Mech) Combat; 7.Soviet Artillery Barrage Phase; 8.Soviet Movement; 9.Soviet Combat; 10.Soviet Special(Mech) Combat; 11.Mutual Disruption Removal Phase; 12.New Turn-Move the Marker 1 box to begin again.

GERMANS:There are Objectives set up for the NON-Player side centered around the 3 PANZER Divisions involved and when some are accomplished or moved to, then NEW ones are determined that they'll have to achieve and this process continues throughout the game. The entrapped 6th ARMY has it's OWN Breakout Decision Table as well. &#10;SOVIETS:The various Soviet CORPS/Armies have differing Objectives according to their COMPOSITION and the GERMAN's Units near them which produces a Modifier which is then applied to the SOVIET die-roll on the Objective Table. This can result in the subject CORPS/ARMY adopting an Elastic-Defense, Fighting-Defense, Hold-at-ALL-Costs, Advance-to-Contact, Limited-Assault, or All-out-Assault which are further explained in the RULES Booklet in greater detail.&#10;&#10;THIS is one of the more professionally produced Games by Perry Moore, et al, and takes an unusual tact in that the Units have Movement Designations using LETTERs instead of NUMBERs for them. These are H-horse drawn~[6]-Movement Points, L-Leg powered(Infantry)~[4]-M.P.s, T-Track equipped~[9]-M.P.s, &amp; W-Wheel based~[10]-M.P.s. Units will also have a Troop QUALITY letter with E=Elite, D=Depleted and NO letter=LINE. This can affect COMBAT &amp; RETREATS, which result in Disruption for Depleted Units although Elite &amp; Line Units are not so affected. The SOLITAIRE Rules have been extensively detailed to allow Players to experience the game system and formulate some strategem which they can apply in some future game against a worthy opponent.&#10;&#10;"

Each player owns a ship.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds in two phases. &#10;In the first phase the object is to trade and acquire wealth as quickly as possible. To that purpose, each player sails from harbour to harbour: in a harbour a commodity can be bought [wheat  - gold - wood - cloth - wool - fruit] &ndash; in some harbours no goods can be bought.&#10;Sailing can be short distance &ndash; form harbour to harbour which are connected by dotted lines or long distance using a &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; card.&#10;Selling goods can take place in any harbour &ndash; player rolls the dice which determines which good can be sold &ndash; always at three times the cost.&#10;Using a &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; card a player can organise a storm in one of the six areas forcing the ships in that area to leave behind their goods in the harbour &ndash; available for the next ship that visits the harbour.&#10;The ships will return again using the dice as this determines to which area the ship will return &ndash; player can choose the harbour.&#10;When 2 ships are going to the same harbour the 2 captains need to fight each other using &ldquo;Squabble&rdquo; cards damaging the opponent more and more [pretty funny descriptions]. The loser of the fight looses his money.&#10;However, cards played do NOT return so there&rsquo;s limited supply. And you will definitely need some of these later in the game.&#10;&#10;The second phase starts as soon as a player is rich enough to acquire the corsair ship &ndash; the corsair ship is auctioned with a minimum cost. The player will then try to eliminate all of his or her adversaries. The dice decides in which area the Corsair ship starts. On the turn of the player &ldquo;owning&rdquo; the Corsair ship he can sail 3 steps &ndash; as opposed to the other players who can only sail to the next harbour. The &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; cards are very valuable now.&#10;When the Corsair ship catches a player&rsquo;s ship that&rsquo;s the end of it: goods return to the bank and the owner of the Corsair gets the money. The Corsair ship has done its job and returns to the bank &ndash; available for another player to buy it.&#10;The Corsair ship is sensitive to the &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; cards and will sink.&#10;&#10;The winner is the one remaining player.&#10;&#10;The rules are simple, but the characters are limited in what he/she can do each turn. Also all eliminated players have to wait until there&rsquo;s a winner and are no longer participating in the game.&#10;&#10;"

These cards depict colored (one-color or rainbow) turtles and movement (1 or 2 steps forward, 1 step backwards; also, in case of some rainbow-colored turtle cards, moving the last turtle forward). When a turtle moves on a space where another turle is waiting, it is placed on the top of that turtle. When a turtle with other turtles on its back is moved, all the other turtles on top of it are carried with this turtle.
