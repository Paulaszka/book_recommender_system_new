Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.&#10;&#10;Along the way, the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, traps, and terrors. From cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms, each challenge is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.&#10;&#10;As these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete the task before them.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to complete every chapter, and then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive; if any player is killed, the game ends immediately!&#10;&#10;"

Each player takes control of an international space agency which must build and launch rockets to the other planets in the solar system. The game features simplified orbital mechanics to generate a constantly changing but predictable board that the players must adapt to.&#10;&#10;Game-play consists of 2 phases per round. The first is the player phase in which players launch and manoeuvre their rockets as well as conducting an action at their base. Once all players have had their turns the second phase is to move the planets and the landed/orbiting rockets.&#10;&#10;The game is won by the player with the most points. These can be earned by completing achievements, where the number of points corresponds to the advancement of a player's space agency, or through completion of specific missions which can be collected throughout the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

A black hole that hungered to consume everything. This darkness is called Demogargano. But there was also light, glimmering and blinding, known to man as God. Existing separate from each other until by chance, or fate, they collided stealing energy from each other creating a new existence. Life blossomed, evolved, and thrived. Like two sides of a coin the light and dark coexisted and influenced man. As time went by the light created Hell as a means to quarantine evil caused by the darkness. Lucifer&rsquo;s fight with God and his ultimate exile resulted in his right to rule Hell.&#10;&#10;Lucifer enjoyed his rule for a millennia until he started to sense the rise in darkness and the existence of Demogargano. After having visons of Demogargano he experienced fear for the first time and left the Golden Bastille in Hell to go into hiding. With his absences many saw the opportunity to seize the power of Hell and three factions were formed. The order of the Devil lead by Belial, seeks to preserve Lucifer&rsquo;s rule for his eventual return, maintaining the power structures as they are. The Council of Hate consists of the armies and legions of hell, military class demons, ruled by Beelzebub. The Council of Hate seeks to bring order to the chaos of Hell no matter the cost, but they also want to destroy Lucifer&rsquo;s legacy and shift the balance of power. The Horde are the embodiment of chaos and pandemonium. They are ruthless, mindless demons who want to overrun Hell and destroy everything in their path. Astaroth is the only one that can control them and keep their bedlam at bay.  Baal, a powerful sorcerer, and second in command of the Horde, turns on Astaroth and casts a spell banishing him to another dimension.&#10;&#10;Lilith, the queen of Hell and estranged wife of Lucifer, senses that Astaroth has vanished and she fears the Horde will over run Hell with Baal at the helm. She finds Baal and challenges him to a battle to the death and wins. By doing so she left the Horde with no leaders, in turn granting them greater power and increasing Demogargano&rsquo;s grip on the world. Lilith could travel through dimensions but she could not sense or locate Astaroth from Baal's spell.  In that moment, Demogargano&rsquo;s presence strengthened and Lilith is seized by the same visions that Lucifer suffered. In effort to preserve Hell and stop Demogargano from destroying everything, she forms the HellBringers. They are a rag tag group of demons, men, creatures, mercenaries, wizards, cyborgs, and the most bad ass pug ever. They are tasked with stopping Demogargano and raising a little hell along the way.  (The story continues in HelllBringers #0, which can be found in the Art of Mark May Volume 1)&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;HellBringers is a card game stemming from the HellBringers first appearance in comics back in 2015 which can be found in the &quot;The Art of Mark May Volume 1&quot;.  Since then the universe has grown to not only include a wide range of intriguing and powerful characters. The villains are what make HellBringers unique.  Set in deep culture and a plethora of mythologies from around the world, HellBringers brings characters from all walks of existence.&#10;&#10;The full 52 card deck comes with 42 characters to introduce you to the HellBringers universe and 10 special weapons cards for multipliers to help you with those BOSS battles! There are 3 ways to play #HellBringers!  Gauntlet Mode, Survivor Series Mode, (Both due in August) and the Game Board mode coming in October!&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;You need two dice, a paper pad, and something to write with to keep track of hit points.  To enhance the hellish experience, 2 skull dice are included with the full game with mat if you buy that reward option. The cards themselves have SILVER FOIL on the front to make everything shiny! Oh....shiny!  Fun to look at. Cards have 6 stat categories that make up a character&rsquo;s total hit points.  The game is played by rolling the dice and using total rolls to take off hit points as an attack. There are weapons cards that act as multipliers and every time you roll doubles it means something different.  Can you get through the first battle of gauntlet or map mode?  Are you ready to bring hell upon your enemies?&#10;&#10;Here are the rules for the game!&#10;&#10;There are three ways to play HellBringers. Survivor Series (Card deck needed only), Board Game mode, or Gauntlet mode (Card deck needed only)&#10;&#10;First take out any card with a 666 or 000 attached to it and put it in separate pile for later. Here are the rules for doubles and the categories for stats.&#10;&#10;Rolling Doubles:&#10;&#10;     1&rsquo;s Into the Snakes Eyes : Instant kill&#10;     2&rsquo;s Double Deuces: Restart battle (All HP reset)&#10;     3&rsquo;s The Tribus &ndash; Attack is 3 times what you roll for the next attack roll. &#10;     4&rsquo;s The Four Highwaymen Cometh &ndash; Choose a card from the deck to help you attack for the rest of the battle. This card cannot be attacked by opponent and will be put back in deck after battle. Do not get to keep for future battles. &#10;     5&rsquo;s The Five have Risen &ndash; Gain back ALL HP&#10;     6&rsquo;s One More to Summon Him &ndash; Roll again , If you can roll a 6 on either dice than you summon Demogargano to fight for you for the rest of the battle. &#10;&#10;&#10;Stat Categories:&#10;&#10;     Evil Within&#10;     Magic&#10;     Durability&#10;     Strength&#10;     Fighting Ability&#10;     Intelligence&#10;&#10;&#10;All categories are added up for total HP of any character.&#10;&#10;Survivor Series mode:&#10;&#10;2 players draw 6 cards a piece. One each until 6 are laid out. They then use 2 dice to roll and determine how much an attack has taken of their opponents HP (Health Points). Overall HP is determined by the combined total of the stat categories on the back of the card. The attack is subtracted from that total number until it reaches zero in which case the opponent is defeated. A notepad is suggested to keep up with HP and attack subtractions. In Survivor Series mode you face off 6 vs. 6 and you can choose to attack anyone in the deck for your turn. Once the card for the opponent is eliminated he goes into a defeated card pile. This continues until the player has defeated all of his opponents cards. The player then gets to revive any fallen cards he may have endured as well as the opponents cards and choose any 6 out of them to proceed forward to fight Demogargano. However, before you do that you must first draw a weapon card from the deck of the weapons cards. Weapons cards act as multipliers for attacks which you will need against Demogargano who will vastly out number you in HP. You also now get your 7th member of your team to help you defeat Demogargano. This is where you will roll one dice. If you get a 1 you get the &ldquo;Bum Jesus&rdquo; card, if you get a 2 you get the Norgren card, if you get a 3 or 4 you get Attila, and finally, if you get a 5 or 6 you get Astaroth. These cards feature different results. Norgren, Attila, and Astaroth all have 666 in one stat category making their total HP brought to the group a welcome asset and required in order to defeat Demogargano as he has 3 over 666 categories. Bum Jesus who you will receive if you roll a one has a 000 stat category making him able to sacrifice himself in order to defeat Demogargano without even rolling the dice. Meaning if you roll a 1 with the dice you win the game instantly.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two people or by yourself battling yourself to see who goes to fight Demogargano.&#10;&#10;Gauntlet Mode:&#10;&#10;In Run the Gauntlet mode the game play of HellBringers is the same except that when you and your opponent draw your first cards you instantly battle them. When the opponent&rsquo;s card is defeated you will then put that card in a separate pile for later. The player then keeps the card with the battle damage of HP that was suffered from the battle. The opponent then draws another card and the battle damaged card from before fights that card. Both players get 6 cards in total and they battle this way until no cards are left for the opponent. The player then chooses 6 cards from his pile and the defeated pile to fight Demogargano and the rules are the same as Survivor Series for the final battle. See above.&#10;&#10;Board Game Version:&#10;&#10;Players rolls one dice.  Player moves spaces until reaching weapons card pick up slots, team builder slots, and also battle zones. Players have the option of killing player and gaining double attack or having player join their team in the battle zones. Weaker players would be a reason you would kill of a player in order to double your attack. At this point you are choosing the bolster your attack rather gain HP of total team. Weapons cards act as modifiers. Team building is the goal of the board along with minor battles before you make it to the end of the game where you fight Demogargano.  Unlike the card deck game version, you do not have the option of rolling for a special character at the end.  You must make up your team as you go and if you are defeated in battle you have to start over.  Game is 1-3 players and you can play by yourself as you just need to roll for the opponent as well during battles.  During battles doubles mean the same as in regular card deck versions of the game.&#10;&#10;Amazing Contributing Artist&#10;&#10;Incredible art from the likes of Mark May, Marat Mychaels, Bob Camp, Chris Giarrusso, Ed Smith, Sean Forney, Steven Pulawa, Ryan Kincaid, Phil Spaulding, Cara Nicole, Brady Overstreet, Rick Lozano, Russ Casseday, and Sara Frazetta (Her first published work, granddaughter of the GOAT Frank Frazetta)!

Shovel Knight: Dungeon Duels  is a 1-4 player side-scrolling, miniatures board game based on the popular video game Shovel Knight by Yacht Club Games. Players will venture into a dangerous dungeon filled with enemies and traps themed to one of the infamous members from the Order of No-Quarter to compete against rival Knights for treasure.  Whichever player has the most treasure at the end of the dungeon is the winner!&#10;&#10;In  Shovel Knight: Dungeon Duels , treasure is earned by rolling dice to defeat enemies, digging up the scattered dirt piles, and finding gold dropped by other players!. As players advance through the dungeon, they're likely to find powerful one-shot items called Relics as well as a friendly merchant named Chester who's willing to exchange some powerful equipment for some of your treasure. When defeated by enemies or falling into deadly spiked pits, players will drop half of their treasure, allowing the other rival players to come by and collect it. Don&rsquo;t worry though, if a player&rsquo;s Knight has been defeated, they spawn back into the game in the following round! Though a player&rsquo;s Knight may be able to wound enemies, they cannot hurt another rival Knight as it is against their chivalrous code (or shall we say...shovelrous code?) The code of shovelry says nothing about pushing each other around, however, as Knights may knock each other into deadly spiked pits, enemies, or otherwise disadvantageous positions!&#10;&#10;Not only will enemies and Knights be moving, but the dungeon itself will too. Like a level you'd see in a classic video game side-scrolling segment, the dungeon will constantly move along with or without you, so make sure to keep up! Each round, the leftmost tile will fall off while a new tile moves on from the rightmost side of the board, and any enemies, treasure, or Knights are then defeated and removed from the board! Once players have dealt with the minions and lethal terrain, they will  face off against a boss from the Order of No-Quarter as the final challenge of the dungeon. Bosses from the Order of No-Quarter are controlled by their own unique AI Deck,  randomizing their attacks for an unforgettable fight. Each time damage is done to the boss players will gain gold, but each time the boss damage them they'll lose gold.

In real-time, the other players bid an amount of money they would pay for these fish. The auctioneer can choose to accept the highest bid or pay that bid themselves. Money from the auction is paid to either the auctioneer or the highest bidder, and can be paid by fixed value money cards, bartered with fish, or both.

These are double sided and chosen randomly each game. Any players who gained fish from an auction in a turn are able to sell fish to the restaurants.

There are countless islands to explore and treasures to seek in these uncharted waters. Go out there and make your fortune, but beware, you&rsquo;re not the only one out there seeking their fortune. Pirates are scouring the waters looking to claim what you&rsquo;ve found, sea creatures lurk in the deep ready to devour you, and your fellow privateers could either help you, or steal your booty for their own purpose. These are lawless and dangerous waters, and you must be prepared for anything. Will you find the treasure you seek, or will you meet your doom? Adventure awaits!&#10;&#10;Each player takes a turn to explore into new tiles, sail through existing tiles, or remain on their current tile and try to get as much treasure as they can. They can find treasure on islands, while diving, after defeating pirates or sea creatures, or even by attacking other players! When players draw a tile while exploring, they place it in any free space adjacent to their ship and move there immediately. There are five special types of tiles that can be drawn: Islands (where you'll find the majority of your treasure), Diving Locations (you need a diving bell to access them), Pirates (the scourge of the seven seas), Sea Creatures (mythical beasts wanting to destroy your ship and eat your crew), and Shops (places to upgrade your ship and crew). The first player to get to 100 treasure in their stash wins the game!&#10;&#10;Buried Treasure is a world building, open world sandbox game that is built as the players take their turn. Instead of using a standard playing board, players build the game board by drawing tiles when they explore the world. If the tiles are ever used up, players can still sail throughout the map trying to find more treasure on islands, by diving, and attacking pirates/sea creatures/other players. Outfitting your ship and crew allows you to specialize your ship to be better at attacking, exploring, defense, or speed. We've also added in storms which can rip parts off of your ship and throw you and other players in range of the storm off course. You never know what to expect when you play this game!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Each player has a hand of twelve cards and tries to work towards a winning hand. Hands are formed based on the sequence of red and black cards in your hand, so you can't freely rearrange the order of your cards. The other catch is that you draw cards two at a time, insert them next to each other, and always discard two adjacent cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring follows this rule: a set is a sequence of N cards starting from one edge of your held cards, followed by the same number N cards of the other color. You may only use one set to calculate your score. If the leftover cards not in the set would form a set on their own then the point value of your hand is half the number of leftovers; otherwise it's the full number of leftover cards.&#10;&#10;Points are to be avoided. You can go out if you have four or fewer points in your hand. When someone goes out, players compare hands and the player with more points is the loser, and takes points equal to the difference in points with a bonus for a perfect hand (0 points) or undercut (where the person who went out had the worse hand). The first player to collect nine points loses the game.&#10;&#10;-- user summary&#10;&#10;"
