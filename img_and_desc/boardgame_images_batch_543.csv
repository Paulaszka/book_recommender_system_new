Each strand connects any two of eight positions spaced equally around the perimeter of the square, with no two strands sharing edge positions.   The images on the two faces of each tile are mirrors of each other.  In addition to the 144 unique tiles there are 6 single stranded tiles that each appear twice, forming a 150 tile set.  Tiles have a colored background that indicates the number of strand crossings contained on the tile:&#10;Blue - no crosses - 50 tiles, 44 unique&#10;Green - one crossing - 40 unique tiles&#10;Yellow - two crossings - 30 unique tiles&#10;Orange - three crossings - 10 unique tiles&#10;Red - four crossings - 6 unique tiles&#10;Purple - one each of five, six, seven or eight crossings&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF GAME:&#10;The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.&#10;&#10;HOW TO SCORE POINTS:&#10;(1) Each player scores points whenever they arrange one or more tiles, alone or in conjunction with other tiles already played, such that some of the strands on the tiles meet up to form a closed loop. Points scored are equal to the number of times the loop crosses itself or any other strand.&#10;(2) Bonus points are awarded when tiles are placed in such a way as to form a ring of tiles enclosing an empty space.  Bonus points scored are equal to the number of free strands pointing into the empty space, but only if it is an even number.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;1. Each player draws twelve tiles at random from the box.&#10;2. Players attempt to arrange their tiles to form a closed loop. The first to succeed places his loop in the center of the table, counts his score, and then draws enough tiles from the box to return his pile to twelve.&#10;3. Play continues to the left until some player reaches an agreed upon value or until the last tile in the game has been drawn.&#10;&#10;RULES OF PLAY:&#10;1. Adjacent tiles must always be placed edge-to-edge and corner to corner, and strands along touching edges must always line up - no dead ends or jogs are allowed.&#10;2. If you cannot build a loop you must forfeit your turn.&#10;3. You may build more than one loop on a single turn, but you cannot place any tile that is not part of a closed loop.&#10;4. If you forfeit your turn you may set aside one or more tiles from your pile and draw new tiles to replace them, returning the others to the box.&#10;5. You may, before placing tiles, swap any tile in your pile with any other tile on the board as long as the swap does not break any closed loop or strand.&#10;&#10;"

The game takes additional inspiration from the Legend of Zelda game series.&#10;&#10;In Wings of Lightning, you play as Skoros, a soldier of Daleko desperate to defend his city from a massive siege by Ahdeen, the demi-god of deceit and his armies.

If you guessed the color correctly, add the card to your strike pile.  If you were incorrect, add the card to your maneuver pile.  Continue this process until you decide to stop or until you have cards in your maneuver pile equal to your Speed.&#10;&#10;The number of cards in your strike pile then determines which combo abilities you can activate, as well as the amount of damage you deal to your enemies.

If the number on that card is equal to or less than that enemy's Aim, you take damage from that enemy.  You can prevent this damage if you have a maneuver card of the same suit.&#10;&#10;The contest version is a 78-page gamebook with a very linear storyline.

For example, Fasts has three cards - Lent, Advent, Fridays; but Prayer has five cards - Adoration, Thanksgiving, Confession, Petition and Intercession. There are 10 sets in all and List cards are provided to help players know how many cards are needed.&#10;&#10;The procedure for collecting the cards is traditional. In your turn, you may ask any player for any card from a set that you already have at least one card from that set. You go on until you are unsuccessful, then the turn passes to the left. There are minor extra rules relating to courtesy and mistakes. Full sets are laid out on the table and are now 'Safe'. It says that once all sets have been collected, each player scores for each set in front of them, 1 point for every card in your collection (which means the larger sets are more difficult to collect but will score more points.)&#10;&#10;The presentation is very unusual. There is no doubt that this is a properly published game, not an amateur production. Yet the cards have very basic illustrations and all text is as if it had been handwritten. I suppose they wanted to give the impression that it was illustrated at Sunday School (which might actually be true).&#10;&#10;THE CHURCH GAME&#10;RULES&#10;1. The cards are divided into sets numbered 1 to 10. Each set consists of a LIST card (no picture) and PICTURE cards, whose names appear all together on the LIST card.&#10;2. Different Sets contain different numbers of cards. The Winner of the game is the person who has collected the greatest number of cards (not sets) after an agreed number of hands.&#10;3. Players cut for deal, the person cutting a card bearing the highest number is the dealer but should two cut the same highest number they cut again until one is&#10;higher than the other. Thereafter the deal passes to the original dealers left.&#10;4. The cards are dealt out singly beginning at the dealer's left. This may result in one or more players having an extra card to begin with but this is immaterial.&#10;5. The game begins with the dealer asking any player for ANY card by name belonging to a set of which he already has one or more cards. E.g. having in his hand the List Card &quot;Greater Sacraments&rdquo; he might ask someone for &ldquo;Baptism&quot;; or having Maniple he might ask for Vestments (the List Card); or Alb (which belongs to the same set).&#10;6. Before every request the player making it must say &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and after a successful one he must say &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;. If he forgets to do either his turn is immediately forfeit; if the latter he must also return the last card so obtained.&#10;7. After a successful request a player may make a further one and continue until either he is unsuccessful or forgets to say &ldquo;Please&quot; or &ldquo;Thank You&quot;. In this case the turn passes to the player on his left and so on round the group.&#10;8. As soon as a player has a complete set he lays them on the table in front of him and they are thenceforth&#10;&quot;Safe&quot; (i.e. none can take them from him).&#10;9. A player must not (with the single exception of Rule 10 below) ask for a card belonging to a set of which he has not at least one card already. Should he accidentally do so (i.e. by imagining that an Amice is a Greater Sacrament and asking for the latter on the strength of possessing the former) he must return the card and forfeit his turn.&#10;10. If a player whose turn it is to ask finds himself without a single card in his hand he may ask for ANY card still in play (i.e. he is exempt from Rule 9). But as soon as he is successful and has a card in his hand Rule 9&#10;applies again.&#10;11. When every card is &quot;safe&quot; the hand ends and players count the cards to their credit and score appropriately. The deal then passes as explained in Rule 3.&#10;NOTE: When players are new to the game it is a help to familiarize them with the sets by giving them a list of the sets&rsquo; names and the numbers on them. These should be withdrawn as players&rsquo; become more familiar with them.&#10;&#10;"

It's easy to learn, but tough to master!&#10;OBJECTIVE: Starting at a Base Station, you build structures, add Oxygen, Water, Crops and other items needed to create your new colony on a distant planet. You may even encounter hostile or friendly aliens. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game claims the planet and victory!&#10;SETUP: Separate all Base Station cards from deck. One per player. This is your starting point. Set aside any unused Base Station cards and out of play in a Discard Pile. Shuffle the deck and deal five cards to each player. Place the rest of the deck face down. This is the Draw Pile. Each player will need a total playing space of approximately 14&rdquo; across and 16&rdquo; down to create a grid of 5 cards across and 4 cards down. Place your Base Station at the top center.&#10;STARTING THE GAME: The player who had their birthday most recently goes first, then play continues around clockwise.&#10;FIRST ROUND: During your turn, draw a card from the Draw Pile.&#10;Lay any card in your hand with a Level of 1, or an Alien Visit, next to or above your Base Station.If you cannot play a card, place one face up in the discard pile.

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player.

This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner.
