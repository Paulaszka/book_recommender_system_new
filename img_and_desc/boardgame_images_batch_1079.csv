Suddenly you hear a commotion around the corner. It seems that EVEYRONE is pouring into a house! One of your neighbors has suddenly left and they are having an ESTATE SALE!  You and your family jump on the opportunity to pick up some art; books; furniture; silverware; and clothes from the home. Over the course of the day you all explore the house in an attempt to find long lost treasurers and some hidden gems. You also stop to participate in some instant auctions against the other families in the home. Of course, one person&rsquo;s trash is another person&rsquo;s treasure as you learn to dumpster dive for some discarded items. No matter what, you always have to remember to move and buy wisely! At the end of the day the family that scores the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;Summary&#10;&#10;Estate Sale is a 1-6 player table top game involving buying; auctioning; and acquiring different items from an estate sale. Players represent families competing against one another to score the most victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;What is an Estate Sale?&#10;&#10;An estate sale is a method of selling ALL (or most) of the contents of a home. Estate sales usually happen after the death of an occupant or other event that causes the inhabitants to quickly move away from the home. Estate sales usually take place over several days and are generally open to the public. An estate sale is like a garage sale or a tag sale. The main difference is that an estate sale is meant to dispose of all of a home&rsquo;s possessions in an orderly manner. Estate sales are much more than a yard sale as EVERYTHING has a price tag. Everything is up for sale.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Expeditions will gather new resources discovered on the island and return them back to the ship. Your goal is to score as many resource points as possible before the end of the game. But your opponent might have other ideas. Both players have to decide when to return back to the ship with the current resources or press your luck, trying to weather the events and retrieve a much bigger load.&#10;&#10;Your ship has five expeditions to send out and collect resources. When it is time, collect the resources and return back to your ship and count the booty. Events may alter the success of your expedition.

It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square grid (board). The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 10x10 squares.&#10;&#10;Both players must have access to a sufficient number of disks of their own color and a sufficient number of neutral blocks.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA group is a disk along with all other like-colored disks one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent disks of its color.&#10;&#10;Similarly, a patch is a square not occupied by a block along with all other such squares one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent squares not occupied by blocks. Note a patch may contain any number of groups, as well as empty squares.&#10;&#10;The size of a group or patch is the number of squares it spans.&#10;&#10;A mound is a set of four blocks occupying a 2x2 area of the board.&#10;&#10;A barricade is a set of three adjoining blocks in a straight diagonal line.&#10;&#10;Mounds and barricades are illegal formations. For the purpose of spotting them, the edges of the board count as lines of blocks. In other words, the real board is considered to be the middle section of an imaginary board with sides two squares longer, and all edge squares on this larger board are considered to be occupied by blocks.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, make exactly one of these board plays:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a disk of your color on an empty square.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move a disk of your color any number of squares in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any blocks or enemy disks, to a square occupied by an enemy disk. Then, remove this enemy disk and place a block on the square from which you just moved your disk, without forming a mound or a barricade. Note a disk can jump over friendly disks.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you have no board plays available on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, for each patch on the board, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from it until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over in a patch owns the patch. Empty patches are owned by neither player.&#10;&#10;The player with the higher score in the resulting position wins. Your score is the sum of the sizes of the patches that you own. If there is a tie, whoever made the last board play loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means Orange will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Blue instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;"

Captain a seven player Gridiron team in the local leagues to develop your favorite Plays, learn to manage player positioning, and how to maximize the impact of your Action Cards.
