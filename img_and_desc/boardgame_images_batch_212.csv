The possible heirs are: the sparing sister Lady Scrape Humbug, the poor old friend of the family Sir Humpty, Trickenham the butler, Miss Fuzzy the careless daughter, Spoiler Humbug the prodigal son,  and Vanity the ambitious mistress.

It could be regarded as an early form of Pinball, but despite its erstwhile popularity, it was all but forgotten in the latter half of the 20th century. Recently replica boards are making a bit of a comeback, and &quot;het Hamertjesspel&quot; can be seen again at village f&ecirc;tes and other occasions that encourage nostalgic throw-back entertainment.&#10;&#10;Four players sit on each side of a square wooden board with raised edges, defending their goal. A marble or small lead ball is dropped in the centre, either by hand or, on the more evolved board versions, through a &quot;fair&quot; central dropping device. Players try to get the marble into an opponent's goal, and keep their own one safe, by using a small wooden mallet (&quot;Hamer&quot; is Dutch for &quot;Hammer&quot;). To make life difficult for the players, the goal is split up in two by a centre isle, and spanned by a rail, so that it is impossible to block both halves simultaneously, or swap the hammer between goal sides easily. The board itself has a few obstacles (usually exposed nails) that deflect the marble.  Game play is best typified as frantic fun.&#10;&#10;The boards tend to have a slight slope towards the centre point. The square versions commonly use 4 wood sections in a pyramid style. The &quot;Karrewiel&quot; (Cart Wheel), which is the round board version usually had more panes to create a nicer circular slope. Occasionally it would also be able to accommodate more than the standard 4 players, or have each player's goal area split in three gaps, rather than two. Most boards would have only one marble in play, but, reportedly, there are variants that had multiple balls simultaneously in the battle arena. If less people were playing, parts of the board could be blocked off using temporary wooden walls.&#10;&#10;Traditionally, the first player to lose a certain amount of goals would have to buy the next round. Like all pub games, it was also played for money, and onlookers placed bets on the game's outcome.&#10;&#10;In 1995 Battle Dome appeared, which is a modern flipper version of this traditional game, with a few added bells and whistles. In 2000 Felsburger produced the traditional Karrewiel version under the name Ch&uuml;ngel. Needless to say, most versions of the game keep coming from the Low Lands wood crafts cottage industry, that is slowly &quot;rediscovering&quot; this lost gem. And since the dimensions have never been standardised, quality and appearance are as diverse as the woodworkers making them.&#10;&#10;"

Play alternates between the Offense and the Defense. The ball is advanced by passing dribbling and heading. When a defensive man is within specific distances from the ball and attempt can be made to tackle or intercept.

Goal tries are similarly determined by die throws adjusted to the positioning of the goalkeeper and other defensive players.&#10;&#10;From Designer's Notes:&#10;KICK-OFF Soccer has been developed to follow as closely as possible the real game of soccer.  The strategy and tactics are the same, as are most of the rules.  Soccer is not a complicated game.  There are very few set plays, these mainly arise on Corners, Free-Kicks and Throw-Ins.  The game is played through with the skills, flair and innovation of individual players working together as a team.  And so with &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, by using simple Basic Moves, the flair and innovation has been left up to the individual player.&#10;After playing one or two games of &quot;KICK-OFF&quot;, the method of play becomes easy and only brief reference is necessary to player and ball movement, and die throws.  The die throws do not determine the outcome of the game, they merely simulate the chances played in real soccer.&#10;&quot;KICK-OFF&quot; has been play tested by enthusiastic &quot;youngsters&quot; aged from eleven to adult.  For the young enthusiasts, some adult assistance was found advisable at first, but once advised, they were at home with &quot;KICK-OFF&quot; as they were on the real field!&#10;&#10;"

Players roll and move around the board. On some spots on the board you will be given the opportunity to enter the SHOW RING and score points for how your horse does. Those points can be traded in for some of what you need. Necessary money is accumulated as you go around the squares on the board.&#10;&#10;"

Object of the game is to move 2 of the 4 pieces on the opposing side of the board.&#10;&#10;The name of the game comes from the moving mechanism of the playing pieces: they can move 1 field in all 4 directions, but they are flipped over every time when they move (I guess they &quot;flop&quot; when moving to the left or right side).&#10;&#10;All playing pieces are numbered from 1-4 on one side and from 5-8 on the other side. Since the pieces are always flipped over, the value of the pieces is changing with every move and it needs much thinking in advance to find the best moves.&#10;&#10;Another problem is, that the pieces should always look in the same direction. To assure this, each piece has 2 dots on the front and 2 on the back, but when comparing the pieces on the game-box with the ones included with this game, it is obvious, that this designing problem is not solved very well.&#10;&#10;"

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;"

If the train is on connection between two stations it must move back to a station to re-coal. If the train is at a station, it may move onto a track connection to make a delivery. Deliveries are payed out based on the goods at the source and the type in demand at the destination (timber, sheep, ore). All stations have spaces for goods to be delivered too. When these are full, that station can receive no more goods. However, space can be made for more goods by delivering passengers.&#10;&#10;The tiles players lay represent track, which they are paid to lay (land grant railway style).

Each child gets a colored shoe as well as a matching shoelace. The shoe has holes which have colored edges. Now, the color die comes into play. The first player tries his luck: If the die shows his own color, then he gets to thread his shoelace into one of the next two free holes in his shoe. If it&rsquo;s a different color, then he has to look carefully: If red was rolled and a free hole is also red, then he gets to thread the lace. If, however, none of the next holes are red, then he gets to give away the color by choosing an opponent who needs the color and can use it to continue threading his lace. As soon as a child has succeeded in completely threading his shoelace, he wins the game. If he can then also tie a knot, he&rsquo;s laughing. The others can practice via the illustrated instructions.&#10;&#10;Ages 4 and up. Artwork: Kerstin V&ouml;lker&#10;&#10;"
