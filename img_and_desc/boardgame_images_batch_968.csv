This is an opportunity to harness the cosmic energy and win the prolonged war between 2 powerful forces: The Virtues and The Sinners.From around the world come the most powerful heroes from both spectrums. They travel to the dangerous shadow realm to claim the power and to keep it from falling into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. Whoever shall claim the millennium gate shall win the war, the Millennium War.&#10;&#10;In the Millennium War, there are two game modes: competitive mode and cooperative mode. In competitive mode, players go head to head while building their strategy by selecting teams of legendary heroes, buying items, preparing passive spells to counterattack, and most importantly planning their actions by managing mana resources and movement across the Millennium Arena. &#10;There are 3 ways to win in competitive mode: eliminate all your opponents' teams of heroes, destroy all your opponents' ancient structures or claim the Millennium Gate by hunting powerful mythical beasts. &#10;Millennium War's competitive mode is inspired by the popular MOBA games but adjusted to be one of a kind as a board game.  You don&rsquo;t win by speed and accuracy, or control of your keyboard, but by how you think and plan your strategy with a combination of choices. Similar to Chess but way more fun. Whether crushing your enemies with extreme power, trapping them with self destruct explosives and sacrificing one of your hero's for a few of theirs, brain controlling enemy hero's or even switching positions, there are endless ways to gain a strategic advantage. Build combos with 35 special Millennium Hero's and their endless combinations of weapons and spells.&#10;In contrast to the swift pace of Competitive mode is the journey to the Millennium world in Cooperative mode, where players must work together to defeat Millennium Bosses. Each Boss presents a unique way of attack and has its own topography that&rsquo;ll require the entire team to solve the puzzle to defeat the powerful Boss.&#10;The game offers countless excitement, it&rsquo;s fun and full of surprises, easy to play and tracks game play because of uniquely designed and patented smart dials, dealer shoes, hero cards and icons. Offering a supporting website featuring hero skills diagrams for easy learning, along with in depth character design inspired by world cultures and game mechanics. The game miniatures are lovingly made with highly detailed craftsmanship by talented artists from around the world. They also magnetically attach to the smart dial.&#10;&#10;"

In this game, players control a rock band attempting to escape demons from Hell, or the demons tracking down the cheapskates trying to skip out on their deal with the devil. It is a diceless 2-player game played on a hex map, involving movement and strategic placement of playing pieces.&#10;&#10;Rock Band Fights Evil is a simple diceless game, with no luck or chance elements.&#10;&#10;Setup - The Hell player places one demon in each hex that is not a corner (three hexes per map edge). The Rock Band player places the relic in the center of the map. He then places one member of the rock band in each hex adjacent to the relic, so that the band surrounds the relic.&#10;&#10;Goal - The Rock Band player's goal is to move the relic off any map edge. The Hell player's goal is to get past the rock band and destroy the relic.&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence - The Rock Band player chooses one token and moves that rocker any number of hexes in a straight line up to its Move trait. Under most circumstances, rockers cannot enter occupied hexes. After that rocker moves, he may attack. Each token has a unique method of attacking and defeating opponents, e.g. &quot;kill each adjacent demon that has no Hell tokens next to it.&quot; When that rocker's move and attack have been resolved, play proceeds to the Hell player. The Hell player's turn sequence is identical to the Rock Band player's.&#10;&#10;Move: Different pieces have different Move values, so the humans have to stay on their toes. Some people are a little quicker than others. We all had that one kid in school who always ended up on our team, but never could pull his own weight. For most of my childhood, I was that kid. Also, demons tend to be a lot quicker than humans. Life's like that.&#10;&#10;Attack: After a unit moves, it can then Attack. This is a diceless act that depends entirely on the positioning of your unit.&#10;&#10;Win Condition: The rockers are trying to retrieve a relic that they intend to use to free themselves from their contract. I won't ruin the surprise; read the books! Anyway, if the rockers can move the relic off the map, they win! If the demons ever are able to maneuver into a position to destroy the relic, they win!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

These forces must be ready to fight and prevail should deterrence fail against a variety of threats in an evolving and uncertain global security environment, and they must be able to do this with acceptable risks &mdash; both in the present against today's threats and in the future against threats that might emerge. Key audiences for these capstone documents include defense planners, programmers, budgeters, managers, analysts, and policymakers who support the development and management of forces that can be postured and employed in alignment with a given defense strategy to accomplish objectives.&#10;&#10;Against this backdrop, RAND researchers developed Hedgemony, a wargame designed to teach U.S. defense professionals how different strategies could affect key planning factors in the trade space at the intersection of force development, force management, force posture, and force employment. The game presents players, representing the United States and its key strategic partners and competitors, with a global situation, competing national incentives, constraints, and objectives; a set of military forces with defined capacities and capabilities; and a pool of periodically renewable resources. The players are asked to outline their strategies and are then challenged to make difficult choices by managing the allocation of resources and forces in alignment with their strategies to accomplish their objectives within resource and time constraints.&#10;&#10;Hedgemony can be played in a modestly sized conference room equipped with a projection screen and a table big enough for the game board and ten to 12 people. Assuming trained players and facilitators are available, a game session of the length necessary to complete a useful number of turns for the session&rsquo;s learning objectives will typically require a half-day or full-day commitment.

Earlier in February the German&rsquo;s Operation Cerberus saw the battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gniesenau, as well as the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen sail up the channel to ports in Germany, beneath the very noses of the RAF and Royal Navy. New German radar and anti-aircraft and shore batteries installed along the north coast of France were making life more dangerous for Allied shipping as well as increasingly dangerous for their bombers crossing the channel to conduct bombing raids in occupied France, Belgium as well as Nazi Germany.&#10;&#10;In May it was decided to conduct a raid on the channel port of Dieppe. Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbattan, commander of the British Combined Operations Center, was charged with planning the raid. It was hoped the raid could cause serious damage to the German&rsquo;s defenses, demonstrate to the Soviets that the Allies were earnest in their desire to quickly take the war to the Germans on the European continent, as well as demonstrating the feasibility of large scale amphibious operations. The RAF was counting on the Luftwaffe also rising up to aggressively defend the skies above Dieppe in a battle the RAF leadership was confident they could win. It was also hoped that intelligence agents, that would land with the 5,000 Canadian and 1,000 British  assault troops (along with 50 US Rangers), could perform &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; operations to capture German code books, samples of their new radar technology, and perhaps an Enigma code machine (this aspect of the raid was overseen by Ian Fleming, the future author of the James Bond novels). An earlier raid to be launched in July, dubbed Operation Rutter, was cancelled but the raid was resurrected in the first week of August and called Operation Jubilee.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your opponents?
