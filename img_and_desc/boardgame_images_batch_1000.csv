If a star comes out on the roll of the dice, the three balls are advanced as many squares as the other dice indicates, and if the two stars come out, the Discomatic mechanism moves in the direction indicated by the arrow.&#10;&#10;Game system:&#10;On each game turn, after the dice are rolled, each player must advance three balls consecutively placed on the board: if the ball located in advance is advanced, the two balls immediately behind must also advance; if you want to advance a ball located in between the heading ball and your boat hold, you must advance those located at its same point of advance or immediately behind it; if you want to play a ball that has not yet entered play, you must advance two others that are still in your own boat (in your side of the board).&#10;&#10;The balls, which can only circulate in one direction: towards the opposing boat, can go ahead passing one over the other (even if they are from opposing sides).&#10;&#10;In each square there can only be one ball, and if it falls on the square occupied by an opposing ball, it is taken prisoner and placed in the hold of the own ship. This rule also applies to orange squares.&#10;&#10;Prisoner rescue:&#10;When, with an exact roll of the dice, with no remaining points, a ball manages to reach an orange square on the opposing ship, it frees as many prisoners as there are points indicated by the immediate roll of a die. If a star appears, the roll is repeated. The ball that has reached the opposing boat is removed from play.&#10;&#10;End of game:&#10;The first player who manages to get six balls to the opposing boat wins.&#10;&#10;"

As a result, it became possible to produce wines of superior quality, particularly in white wines made from black grape varieties. While Dom Pierre P&eacute;rignon initially felt the sparkling of the wine was a negative feature, the consequent increase in both quality and quantity created the path that lead to the appreciation and recognition of champagne.&#10;&#10;Throughout the 18th century, several &quot;champagne houses&quot; &mdash; or Champagne Maisons &mdash; were founded, and a new business dynamic grew in the region. These houses replaced small farm and monastery production in leading the evolutionary process of champagne, and by planting more vineyards or buying grapes from other producers or both, they mastered the specialization. To promote their product, the houses hired sales agents to take samples of their champagne wines to the Royal Courts of Europe, a crucial factor in generating the glamorous fashion of drinking champagne.&#10;&#10;Despite production growth, improved quality, and increasing popularity, trade did not reach spectacular rates during the 19th century &mdash; which is why the game Dom Pierre is much more about winning prestige than earning money. In the game, you are responsible for one of the oldest Champagne Maisons, producing and selling wine all over Europe, not to mention the other side of the Atlantic. The local economy will be boosted, employment increased, and your brand will become universally recognized.&#10;&#10;To make all this happen will require a chain of actions that starts in your vineyard. You will need to look for continuous improvement, constantly react to your opponents, and optimize your choices to build the most prestigious Champagne Maison. In game terms, on a turn you move up a disc on the winery game board and perform an action, with the actions become more powerful as the game progresses. You will plant in the vineyards, harvest crops, buy grapes from neighbors, make wines in your cellar (some more valuable than others), allocate salespeople on four market routes and workers in the vineyard and cellar, and acquire the necessary accessories to improve production.&#10;&#10;"
