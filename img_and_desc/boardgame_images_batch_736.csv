Only half survived the winter. Who will you eat to be one of them?&#10;&#10;Each player has a family of settlers (color coded), and a few hirelings or settlers outside that family. While individually named, all of these actually represent several people (you are not playing all 81 settlers).&#10;&#10;You get points for each settler you have alive at the end of the game, with bonus points for healthy settlers, oldest settler, youngest settler and an intact family. Things you do in the game cause you to accumulate &quot;Shame&quot;, which are cards with random values that you draw but do not look at, and whoever has the highest Shame at the end of the game loses, regardless of their score.&#10;&#10;Play proceeds in rounds, moving through a chronologically stacked Forage deck that represents the winter of 1846. Each round a player has a personal forage step, and then there is a group forage step. In the latter, players bid to acquire extra food and the bid is how much Shame they are willing to draw to get that food. The number of group forage cards available in a turn is always less than the number of players, so someone gets left out every time. Additionally one of the group forage cards is dealt face-down, so you do not know what it is. Ties in bidding are broken by the party leader, a role which rotates around the table. Players who do not get a forage card in the group step get to draw an Action card instead.&#10;&#10;Then, everyone feeds their settlers, with weakened settlers costing less food than healthy ones. But weakened ones also do not forage as well. Losses from hunger have to follow a few simple rules, like none of your settlers can starve to death until all of them are weakened.&#10;&#10;In addition to forage, there are action cards that players can acquire through the foraging process. These are the nasty things like murder and grave robbing and such. These can be played at any time and generally give you food, but unlike Forage cards, have an inherent Shame cost to play them.&#10;&#10;This process continues until either the Forage deck empties or the &quot;final rescue&quot; card is drawn during March 1847. Since some cards are randomly removed from each game before play, you never know exactly when the game will end or what the weather will be and thus cannot plan for it.&#10;&#10;"

Using the unique dice mechanics of the game, you will scheme, bribe, extort, recruit, and command syndicates in order to fulfil your persona agenda, winning only if you meet more conditions stated on your hidden Mafioso card than other players by the end of 5 rounds. There are many paths to victory; strategise by building your empire with filthy lucre, or recruit&nbsp;various soldati to carry out your dirty jobs and dominate the syndicates early. To emerge triumphant, you must learn to negotiate and manipulate your opponents ruthlessly.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player is dealt a hidden mafioso identity (E.g. Godfather, Don, Informant) at the start of the game. Scoring conditions are specific to each identity, and the score for each player will be tallied after 5 rounds of gameplay.&#10;&#10;Much of Lawless Empire revolves around dice placements. Dice are tactically allocated to the various plans in the fight for bribery tokens, lucre tokens, new soldati, and control of syndicates. Players can ask for assistance from other players after they gain control of a syndicate. Controlling or assisting a syndicate will allow players to give hidden orders to the syndicate. There are 2 types of orders with varying strengths: to secure or to sabotage. Orders given to syndicates will be revealed at the end of 5 rounds to determine if each syndicate is secured or sabotaged. Depending on your mafioso, you will score based on how many syndicates are secured or sabotaged, and/or whether you control or assist the syndicates.&#10;&#10;The distinctive feature of Lawless Empire shines through its workings of dice control and interactions, abetted by soldati power and scheme cards. Concealed scheme cards are played on each plan by the players, sneakily altering how each individual plan is won. For&nbsp;example, a plan is normally won by the player with the highest total value of dice allocated to it, but the &ldquo;Underhand Attacks&rdquo; scheme card dictates that the player with the lowest total value wins instead. On the other hand, your soldati will grant you the ability to control the dice (including your opponent&rsquo;s) after their placement (e.g. to move or exchange dice around plans, or even rotate a dice to any value). This combination of allocation, scheme cards, and soldato abilities presents a fresh take on the otherwise luck-dependent dice mechanics, thus ensuring a thrilling and compelling game without repetition. The hidden elements in the game (mafioso, scheme cards, syndicate orders) provide a good setting for players to bluff, negotiate, persuade, and trash talk. However, players who are intimidated by such interactions can be assured that the game can be won by outwitting everyone.&#10;&#10;"

Some of the new concepts are:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Superior armor and status when battling&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cavalry units increase to 4 blocks&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Heavy infantry battle dice are reduced from 5 dice down to 4&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Light Bow Cavalry units can employ the Parthian Shot when they evade&#10;&#10;&#10;Still, some Commands &amp; Colors game mechanics remain familiar to players of other games in the system, like the deck of Medieval Command cards that drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war,&rdquo; and the battle dice that will resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The stylized battlefield scenario maps emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible, and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a unit may represent a Chiliarchy of soldiers, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. The battlefield tactics, however, that you will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various medieval unit types, their weapons, the terrain, and history.&#10;&#10;The medieval battles showcased in the scenario book focus on the historical confrontations between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persians (530 to 627 AD) with a slight detour to battle the Moors and their rebel allies (645 - 648 AD). The Byzantine Empire during this period of medieval history was one of constant transition and reorganization. Its army tended to mirror its eastern adversaries by deploying an increasing number of armored cavalry formations (Cataphracts) and more missile troops. Yet, it was how the Byzantines adapted their battlefield tactics in relation to the enemy it faced that is perhaps the chief reason for the longevity of their Empire.&#10;&#10;Although the Byzantine army fought on other frontiers, against a multitude of opponents, Visigoths, Vandals, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alemanni, those conflicts are beyond the scope and space of this one package. Additional expansion modules that address those battles will be forthcoming.&#10;&#10;"

It can be played in various size boards: 8x8, 10x8 or 12x8.&#10;&#10;The objective is to stalemate the opponent or to capture his entire army.&#10;&#10;Classical captures (custodial and corner) apply to Petteia XXI in addition to the following capturing tactics:&#10;&#10;     Push and Crush Attack&#10;     Flank Attack&#10;     Phalanx Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;Aditionally, Petteia XXI has locked soldiers (similar to blocked pawns in Chess) which strategically limit pieces mobility to increase capture opportunities, and to minimize the chances of draws.&#10;&#10;http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/petteia-latrunculi-xxi&#10;&#10;"

The two dragons are controlled by both teams in turn.  Whenever a player moves a dragon they remove the tile that it came from, thus shrinking and changing the layout of the board over the course of the game.  A wizard is eliminated if a dragon moves onto the wizard&rsquo;s tile.  Play continues until one team is eliminated and the surviving team wins.&#10;&#10;"

The earliest of the four battles collected herein saw two of William's sons duking it out. The other three battles are all drawn from the reign of Stephen of Blois, the Conqueror's grandson, and the long period of instability and intermittent civil war that has come to be called The Anarchy. During the twelfth century, armies tended to avoid giving battle to one another, and when it did come to blows, neither side exhibited much endurance; there's none of that &quot;they fought from sunrise to sunset&quot; stuff here. Nor was anyone involved particularly renown for any special military genius. As a result, the battles here are short, small, and uncomplicated affairs, ideal both for solitaire study, and for a quick game with a friend. That's not to say the battles are lacking in flavor, however, as each brings something unique to your table.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Tinchebray (1106) gives each player Wings composed of both cavalry and foot soldiers, and arrayed in echelons. S &amp; S vets know that horse and non-horse units don't support the other's attacks, which makes things tricky. The battle turns on the timely (or not) arrival of a hidden English Wing.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Standard (1138) is a matter of English quality versus Scots quantity. The English have a good defensive position, and are mostly arrayed into a single Wing (with all the pluses and minuses that come with it). Successive waves of Scots will usually be forced to attack the English piecemeal. The English have the advantage in the early game, but the longer the game runs, the more Scottish numerical superiority will rule the day. To recreate the spectacularly lopsided victory that the English enjoyed historically, the English player will have to seal the deal in the early going.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Lincoln (1141) might be described as a game of &quot;press your luck&quot; for poor King Stephen. He has some good units, but as soon as one Wing defects, the others might follow, turning an even contest into a slaughter. His Angevin opponent must make good use of not only his horse, but also his Welsh infantry, which is fearsome but brittle.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Wilton (1143) commences at dusk, and ends at nightfall. This means the battle has a time pressure element, quite unusual for the S&amp;S system. Neither player knows exactly when the battle is going to end. Will the Blesevins break through the Angevin line, or will Stephen's retreat be covered by his gallant rearguard?&#10;&#10;The SHIELDS &amp; SWORDS II series builds on, and improves, the Shields &amp; Swords series of games (We Happy Few, Stamford Bridge, A Hill Near Hastings, and Our Royal Bones), with a greater variety of unit types, revised suppression rules, and a new D8-based CRT. S&amp;S II revolves around the activation of Wings using double-sided Command Markers, with a flexible scale and simple, easy-to-teach rules.&#10;&#10;"

The things to be mimicked fall in one of four categories, each one of which has an associated mask to be worn by the player that will attempt the mimicry: actions (mime mask); places (Indian mask); animals and things (tiger mask); and school (teacher mask).&#10;&#10;Teams advance their tokens along the game board by rolling one die, as long as they keep succeeding in guessing the mimicked concept after each throw of the die.&#10;&#10;The goal is to be the first team to reach the last space in the game board (number 36).&#10;&#10;Game contents:&#10;-Game board.&#10;-Hourglass.&#10;-4 masks.&#10;-144 word cards.&#10;-12 joker cards.&#10;-4 team tokens.&#10;-1 die.&#10;&#10;"

The card you draw will tell you to place the card on another player somewhere on their body and it may tell you to touch them with a head, hand, or foot. If you're given a card you must keep it in place and not let it fall even while you're placing cards on other people.
