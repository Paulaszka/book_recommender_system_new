The game uses a board, a cup and a plurality of cards. The cards are randomly transferred to and from the players. The players use the cards to form words. In the best mode, a game board defines a flat surface bounded by a peripheral wall upon which the cup freely travels about. A player begins a turn by spinning the cup, which eventually lands upon a card transfer space. The card transfer space dictates whether the player either draws or passes cards. The player transfers cards either from the deck or to a discard pile or to or from another player during a turn. Then the player attempts to spell a word by selecting cards in his hand and laying them face-up in front of him. Opponents may challenge the player's word. Any player who transfers all of his cards during a set becomes empty-handed and may not challenge words. The number of points earned by each player is dependent upon their performance both in forming words and in manipulating the number of cards in their hand. Preferably, a chance card multiplies the number of points a player can get. The set ending player's total score is doubled if the player ended the set with the chance card. Other player's scores are multiplied by zero if they held the chance card when an opponent ended the set.&quot;&#10;&#10;In English, players use a cup shaped spinner that will move around the 5x5 board to determine card movement between the players. Players have to build words from their available cards and score points displayed on the cards.&#10;&#10;"

The game is a race from the bottom of England to the top of the mainland of Scotland with progress made by the roll of a dice. Players have to abide by the instructions on the board which may aid or hinder progress.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the Lands End to John O'Groats cycling competition which is not strictly a race but a time trial competition. The cyclist pictured on the game box is Sir Hubert Opperman (known as Oppy), considered as one of Australia greatest sporting heros in the 1920's and 30's. In 1934 is set a new record from Lands End to John O'Groats cutting more than 4 hours of the previous time.&#10;&#10;At least 2 versions of the game box exist with a smaller rectangular box and a larger more square box. Both versions have the same game board layout and rules and a photo of Hubert Opperman on the game box, although the photos differ.&#10;&#10;The game rules indicate that the game is included in a series of games that were produced by the National Games Company and may imply this game was also manufactured by National games. No reference to National games is on the board or box but playing pieces are similar in style to boxed National Games and National games did produce many of their games in 2 sizes.&#10;&#10;"

The other player(s) become the mob. The mob divides one hundred mob tokens as evenly as possible. One mob player, acting as host, reads a question and its three possible answers aloud. The mob players use their tokens to secretly choose one or more answers.&#10;&#10;When the mob players have finished distributing all of their tokens, the contestant may ask for one of three helps before giving a response to the question. The helps one response of the contestant&rsquo;s choosing), Trust the Mob (the contestant is forced to choose whichever response has the most tokens on it) or Ask the Mob (this eliminates one wrong response). The contestant can use each help only once.&#10;&#10;If the contestant gives the correct response, the money is added to the bank equal to the level the player is on multiplied by the number of tokens the mob has put on the wrong responses. The levels start at $1000 and ascend to $10,000. The mob tokens that are on the incorrect responses are out of play.&#10;&#10;The game is over when the contestant gives an incorrect response. This means the money in the bank is divided among the mob players who still have tokens.  The contestant wins $1,000,000 when the mob loses all its tokens. The contestant can quit the game before ascending to the next level and keep whatever money has been accumulated in the bank.&#10;&#10;Players continue the game until each player has been the contestant. A running total of the scores of each game is kept. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Considering that the television series uses 101 contestants, this is reasonable faithful translation of the television series.&#10;&#10;Intended for 2 - 4 players Ages 12 and up&#10;&#10;"
