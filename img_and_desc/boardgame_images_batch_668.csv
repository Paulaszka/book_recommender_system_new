Players take control of the cities of Athens and Sparta and train soldiers, construct buildings, capture cities, and engage in epic battles for the future of Greece. Players control their empire from a full campaign perspective on the game board, but once a battle begins, players can command their soldiers in tactical, unit-by-unit combat on separate battlefield maps.&#10;&#10;Game turns are divided into the four seasons of the year. Each season has four phases in which players: 1) Build up their empire by recruiting units, constructing buildings and conducting diplomacy. 2) Move their units around the Campaign Map and besiege cities. 3) Engage in battle and command their soldiers in tactical, simulation combat. 4) Protect themselves against revolts of the people and the stormy seas of the Aegean.&#10;&#10;Every triumph brings your city more glory, and closer to victory, until all Greece kneels before you. Throughout the game players earn things called Glory Points for doing things like capturing cities, winning battles &ndash; even just by proving that your enemy is too cowardly to come out and fight. Whichever player is the first to get to 75 Glory Points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The events cards play the part of creating an additional element of the unknown into every game so that the same scenario can only rarely ever play the same way twice.  Mahdists are on larger style crafted bases for ease of movement and each base represents 100 men (scale of 1:10) even though there could be as few as 5 figures on a base if desired.&#10;&#10;The Imperials are all played by the gamers.  &quot;Us&quot; against the Umpire is great fun!&#10;&#10;This is also the perfect game for Solo play.&#10;&#10;Organisation is based on five companies to a regiment each company consisting of 12 figures.  Once again, you can use 12 or as few figures as you wish as figures are never removed from bases but marked off on an easy to use Roster sheet.&#10;&#10;Cavalry work in squadrons and Troops and artillery batteries in sections up.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a 44 page gloss laminated booklet and a deck of random event cards.

(Climb ON!) is a Japanese board game produced by the doujin circle Kichikichian.&#10;&#10;Climb ON! is a tile placement game with a theme of lead climbing. You assume the role of a climber and create climbing routes by placing wall panels on the board. Several squares are drawn in a wall panel. You roll dice and advance the number of squares, heading the top of the wall.&#10;&#10;Every action consumes stamina, so you need to rest during your climb. You can try to make a challenging climb to the top without a rest, but it comes with a risk of falling down. To save you from falling down, a belayer controls a rope tied with you. You win the game if you climb up to the top of the wall first.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with the game Climb On! which is completely separate.&#10;&#10;Publisher's

The coconut cards have powers on them that come into effect when that card is active during the game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts nine rounds. Each player has a deck of monkey cards numbered 1-10, and to start play, they each shuffle their deck, lay two cards at random face down in the front of them (looking at them whenever they like), then take a hand of three cards. In a round, the players look at the coconut card for this round (as indicated on the Las-nut card), choose a monkey card in hand, then reveal them simultaneously. If two or more players lay down the same card, they're out for the round. After taking into account the coconut's power, whoever played the highest card wins the round and places a token on the card.&#10;&#10;The Las-nut card is claimed in the final round, with whoever has the highest total in the two cards set aside claiming it. (These cards can possibly be swapped during play.)&#10;&#10;If a player has ever placed three tokens in a line on the grid, that player wins immediately. If this doesn't happen, whoever has placed the most tokens (with the Las-nut counting as two) wins.&#10;&#10;"

Before starting the game, each player can exchange their Emperor pawn with another of their pawns elsewhere on the board. On your turn, you must do both phases in this order: the action phase, then the reinforcements phase. During the action phase, you must perform one single action:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move: Move to an empty space, regroup or attack; you can attack only a stack of enemy pieces that contains strictly fewer pieces than the attacking stack &mdash; except that a stack of four pieces can be attacked and destroyed by a stack of one piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Construct: You can construct only one building per space; subsequent construction on the same space replaces the existing building. Each terrain type allows specific types of construction. In order to construct a building on an empty space or on a space already containing one of your buildings, you must sacrifice pieces from a single stack adjacent to this construction space. &#10;&#10;&#10;Once per turn, you can take an extra action by sacrificing three stackable pieces. A stack that contains the Emperor can attack an enemy stack even if it contains an equal number of pieces, and even if it contains another Emperor. Each enemy Emperor you have captive is worth 3 VP.&#10;&#10;During the reinforcements phase, if you have pieces in your reserve, you must return at least one piece to play if you can.&#10;You can place up to three pieces onto a single stack of your color on the board (never on an empty space), respecting the following rule: You cannot place reinforcements on a stack if it is adjacent to another player's building.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when a player has amassed 12 VP by adding up the values of his buildings on the board and any Emperors they have captured &mdash; each village is worth 1VP, each tower 2VP, and each castle and captured Emperor 3VP &mdash; and they have at least one palace.
