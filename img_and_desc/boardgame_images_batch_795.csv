While inspired by that game, the rules have been simplified allowing for an easy-to-learn game that still has elements of chance with a need for strategy.&#10;&#10;Like the original game, Fours is a race to move checkers through a course.  Opponents can knock each other off the course, but there are 'safe' spaces.  The 'fours' theme is evident throughout the game - dice yield a result of 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Safe spaces occur every 4 spaces. Each player has four checkers to run through the course.  A roll of 4 allows a player an extra roll.&#10;&#10;One of the most unique design elements of the game is the portability.  The game 'board' is actually a fabric game mat with a rubberized backing.  This allows it to conveniently fold and pack into a small pouch easily carried in a purse, backpack, or briefcase.  Unlike modern recreations of the game, a large, bulky wooden board is not required.&#10;&#10;"

For the single Megacorp player, to acquire all the Platform Coops transforming them in its subsidiaries. For all other players, who play as Platform Coops, to earn 5 happiness points. Players can decide whether the game ends as soon as one Platform Coop reaches their goal, or all are required to reach the 5 happiness points.&#10;&#10;How is it won or lost? Players win when they reach their goal.&#10;&#10;What do players do in their turns? Each player picks a new card which goes in their hand, and also may play a card as a new service of the coop or Megacorp. Each player has then to pay taxes and compute earnings, which are determined by the cards that they have played. For coop players, the effects of the cards of their deck are integrated with those of the shared service which require all coops subscription to become effective.&#10;&#10;The game is available as print and play, all materials available on Github with the rules.
