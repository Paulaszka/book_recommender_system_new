During the day, players travel around the magical city of Elysia to work towards one of two main objectives: accumulating energy at The Origin, or banishing opponents from the council. Both are accomplished through voting, so securing the trust and cooperation of other players is key to victory. Players can also draw and play spells or magical artifacts to gain a strategic advantage.&#10;&#10;At night, players further their agendas by Mindwalking one of their opponents. Mindwalks are issued by passing written commands to the victim, hidden from their opponents' view. These commands are open ended and completely up to the player's imagination!&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player or faction completes their hidden win condition. Will you be the one pulling the strings over the council, or will you end up dancing to someone else's tune? Control your opponents. Control destiny.&#10;&#10;"

Rummy style game where you make kits or runs, make the right combinations, and be the first to go out - then watch your opponents scramble to cut their losses. The goal of the game is to be the player with the lowest score at the end of the 10th round by making your entire hand into kits and/or runs.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two 44-card decks. Each deck has four WILD cards and four colors: Blue, Gold, Green, and Purple. Each color has ten cards, 3 through 12. Wild cards can be considered any number or color that you wish. There are also rotating wild cards that change every round. The rotating wild cards depend on the number of cards dealt that round. When 3 cards are dealt, the 3&rsquo;s are wild, when 4 cards are dealt the 4&rsquo;s are wild and so on until the last round when the 12&rsquo;s are wild.&#10;&#10;A kit is three or more cards of the same number and can be any color. You can have as many wild cards in a kit as you want. A run is three or more consecutive cards of the same color. A wild card can replace any card in a run. You can have as many wild cards in a run as you want and they can be adjacent to one another.&#10;&#10;Dealing: &#10;1. Shuffle both decks of cards together. &#10;2. For the first round deal 3 cards to each player, dealing one card at a time. Note: For each round of play, the number of cards dealt increases by one card. In the second round 4 cards are dealt, in the third round 5 cards are dealt, and so on until dealing 12 cards to each player in the final round. The dealer position rotates after each round. &#10;3. Place the remaining cards in the center of the table and turn over the top card. The stack of cards is the draw pile and the card turned up is the start of the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Playing: &#10;1. The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues clockwise. &#10;2. Start your turn by taking the top card on the discard pile or drawing a card. &#10;3. Complete your turn by discarding one card. &#10;4. Continue to make kits and/or runs until you are able to go out. &#10;5. Going out: Once all of the cards in your hand are part of a kit or run, lay down all of your cards face up on the table before discarding your last card. &#10;Note: you must be able to make kits and runs from the exact number of cards dealt in the round. You must have one card left to discard. You can go out on your very first turn. &#10;6. Once a player has gone out, all other players have one final turn. Start your turn as normal and after discarding, lay down your kits and runs. Any cards that do not fit in a kit or run will count toward your score. &#10;7. The cards that are in kits and runs do not count toward your score. Players add up only their unused cards. The card values are equal to the number on the card and Wild cards are worth 20 points. The player that goes out first gets a score of -5. The scorekeeper records and adds up the score for each player. &#10;8. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left shuffles all of the cards and deals the next round. &#10;Note: Increase the number of cards dealt by one card and keep track of the rotating Wild cards&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

In the first phase, players stand around the box and try to throw everyone else's  stones in the box. This phase ends when all the stones of one player/color are in the box. Players get a point for each of their stones in the box.&#10;&#10;At the start of the second phase, someone chooses a handicap card and everybody tries to pick their stones out of the box with this handicap at the same time.

Antonio Vivaldi would have composed the oratory Juditha triunphans devicta Holofernis barbarie to celebrate this great victory.&#10;&#10;In Corf&ugrave; 1716 you will find 12 Venetian combat units, divided into 6 German Mercenary units, 3 Italian infantry units and 3 Ultramarine infantry and 20 Ottoman combat units, divided into 4 Janissaries units, 9 Kapikulu infantry and 7 auxiliary Serhaddkulu units representing the regiments and units employed during the siege. &#10;There are two Morale chits for a total of 34 pieces, 2 d6s, a map, 9 Special Event Cards and the rules.&#10;&#10;The map represents the area where the battle took place; it is used to register the orders and the consistency of the two armies. &#10;The map is divided into Area, where to deploy the units and where the actions take place during the 20 turns. &#10;There are the Combat Tables, with the result of the Combat and the Morale Track, which registers the Morale level of the two armies and the Turn Table.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Numerous guests had accepted the invitation to the funeral service for the late queen, and now await the mourning king&rsquo;s eulogy. After all, he is now without an heir to the throne &ndash; and many of those present sense an opportunity for themselves. When the king finally rises, there is a hushed silence. He raises his goblet and lets his keen gaze wander from face to face. &ldquo;Few of you are here to mourn my beloved wife with me,&rdquo; the king begins, and takes a sip from the goblet. Suddenly he begins to cough and puts his hand to his throat. He collapses, knocking food from the table. A murmur goes through the crowd as orders are shouted frantically for aid. The king is carried out of the hall in a hurry, and minutes of dismay pass. Then the personal doctor emerges and announces to all, &quot;The king is dead!&quot;&#10;&#10;In UNDO: Long Live the King, players learn the rules and encounter the starting situation of the case on the first few cards, which also guide them through the setup. Once the setup is complete, players carry out nine time jumps. Every jump takes them to one independent moment from the past and allows them to change that moment in one of three ways, which may change the starting situation for better or for worse. The players need to discuss what they know and try to come up with theories about the story, using the clues they gather from the different time jumps.

The concept behind Mur's game design draws inspiration from the book of Genesis. The Mur board is a round grid with 25 intersections and the playing pieces are small checkers engraved with ancient galleys making the game set reminiscent of the ancient city of Atlantis as described by Plato in his Critias dialogue.&#10;&#10;There are a total of 15 game pieces: 14 ships and one kraken. Seven ships are black and belong to the first player, seven ships are white and belong to the second player, and one piece&mdash;the kraken&mdash;is red and is a neutral piece. On their turn, a player may place, move, or withdraw a ship. Ships that have been surrounded (closed on) by an opponent must be removed by its owner but may return to play on a later turn. Since there is no capturing and therefore no permanent elimination of material or territory, the game of Mur functions as a perpetually shifting puzzle. The goal is to be the first player to execute three closes, OR the first to execute a close on the Kraken. Visit murfederation.com to learn more!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

But the value of the currency depends on how much faith each trader has in the religions. Players are trying to promote the worship of one deity, whilst also preparing to switch allegiances if the deity falls from favour.&#10;&#10;The game has a market board to show the relative exchange rates, and a track board to show how the faith is fluctuating, using small cubes for each religion (the rulebook is called Prayer's Guide).&#10;&#10;There is a deck of cards which is used to calculate the player's score at the end of the game. At the start of the game, two cards are dealt up to move two prices. Then the deck is shuffled and players are dealt three cards. Four more cards are dealt up to form a draft.&#10;&#10;The game has a huge stack of crisp bank notes, beautifully illustrated in the style of real banknotes, to represent each religion. The Esoteric Order Of Dagon is the US dollar, and the Euro (Zeus), Yen (Amariti) and Yuan (Communism) are also used, along with a Flying Spaghetti Monster coin (banknote). The backs of the notes are blanked, so players cannot know what anybody is holding. Players are dealt two notes of each of the five types at the start.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of rounds, one more than the number of players. In a round, a player may trade currencies with the bank, or change their faith, or adjust the market prices.&#10;&#10;When a player trades currencies, they sell what they want from their supply and buy from the bank at the current rates. The number of banknotes exchanged then alters the faith in each currency.&#10;&#10;For example, a player might sell 2 Communism at 12 each, and buy 3 Amariti at 8 each. This moves the Communism cube along the faith track two places, and the Amariti cube moves three places. The Communism cube is now on a +1 space, so the price rises to 13. The Amariti cube is now on a +/-2 space, so the player can move the price up or down two places, for example up to 10.&#10;&#10;Moving these cubes triggers the round ending. When a faith cube has lapped and reached its starting point, the day's trading ends and a new round starts.&#10;&#10;A player can change their faith by discarding and drawing cards from the open supply or the top of the deck. Each religious card shows an effect on the value, dependent on the number of cards held (1,2 or 3). The value of the religion is based upon different factors, such as how much the price is, or how much total currency is held, or for the FSM, how many sets of notes you can form.&#10;&#10;The final action a player can take is simply to move a faith cube, and adjust the market price accordingly.&#10;&#10;Players continue to take turns carrying out these actions, until the round ends, and after the final round ends, players calculate their scores. A player's score depends on how many of which faith card they hold, and the relative prices, and how many banknotes they hold. Once calculated, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;By the open trading of banknotes and open adjusting of prices, other player's might deduce what hidden faith cards a player holds. But a player could be bluffing and trying to manipulate the market whilst holding different faiths in their hand. As the market develops, a player will want to switch their faith to maximise their final score.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

The secret orders can be as simple as occupying three red squares (which can be occupied by moving pieces and entering red squares), or as complex as having the hero piece, which is one's alter ego, defeated first among all players (usually, the player loses when the hero piece is defeated).&#10;&#10;Therefore, for example, if you forcibly aim at a red square that is not necessary, other players may find out about your secret order and interfere with it, and if you unnaturally leave the pieces that protect the heroic pieces empty, they will also find out and it will be difficult to achieve your secret order. The key to the game is how to approach the secret mission secretly and inconspicuously.&#10;&#10;The board may be unfavorable, but...&#10;&#10;There are two special squares on the board: the red square is a recruiting base and the yellow square is a treasure base. When you occupy a recruiting base, you can add your own pieces to it every turn. When you occupy a treasure base, you can draw strategy cards that allow you to perform special moves such as double moves.&#10;&#10;These recruiting bases and treasure bases are the conditions for many secret orders, so you have to guess whether other players are simply occupying them to gain an advantage in the game, or whether they are actually close to achieving their secret orders. Of course, you can use your own pieces and strategy cards to interfere with other players, but it is also very effective to make use of the fact that the secret orders are undisclosed to encourage other players to interfere without getting your hands dirty.&#10;&#10;In addition, since all players want to have a useful base of troops and treasure, alliances will be formed early in the game, either by using pieces and strategy cards to fight for the base, or by spontaneously forming alliances to share the base. There are no penalties for betraying alliances, so don't hesitate to betray an alliance if you think you can fulfill a secret order and get closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Repeatable and fun!&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, in addition to the secret mission card, seven different hero cards are dealt to the player in public, and each of the seven heroes has various characteristics: some are good at power play by sending out many pieces, some are good at trick play by making use of strategy cards, and some are good at slowly accumulating strength in a safe area. Since seven types of secret mission cards are combined with these unique heroes, the fighting style changes every time, so you can enjoy the game for a long time without getting bored.&#10;&#10;Also, the initial placement of the hero pieces is determined by the hero cards. It is quite advantageous if the initial placement is close to the base which is the victory condition. However, if other players think that the victory condition is too early, you will be attacked from many directions or receive a concentrated fire of strategy cards, and it is not easy to win. Try to avoid letting your opponent know your victory condition.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, you will be at a disadvantage if the base that is the victory condition is far from your initial placement. Use all possible means to achieve a victory on thin ice, such as boldly attacking and destroying the opponent's heroic pieces, making alliances with other players using the opponent with an advantage on the board as a common virtual enemy, or forcing them to fight each other.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Dragon CEOs run pharmaceutical companies while flame demons prowl the back alleys and kobold zealots trade shots with an elf hacker.&#10;&#10;CHA features a full campaign game where your punks gain experience, find new cool gear and hopefully don't end up face down in a rainy alley when a security guard finally frags them.&#10;&#10;Random events, extensive lists of gear and abilities and a huge array of creatures are present in the book, allowing for you to really immerse yourself in the world of cyber fantasy.&#10;&#10;The combat system is based on Squad Hammer and Chrome Hammer allowing fast, colorful combat without being bogged down by complex rules, letting you focus on the scenario you are playing and the enemies you are facing down.&#10;&#10;Intended from the ground up as a solo game, all you need is a handful of miniatures to get started doing battle on the blood-slick streets, in VR space or the astral plane! Each campaign sees you fighting the mega-corps leading to an epic showdown against their monster CEO.&#10;&#10;All of this is supported by included random tables to add flavor to the game experience.&#10;&#10;This is a fantastic opportunity to use some figures you have not had a chance to use yet, plan some wild new paint jobs or conversions or bring some beloved old favorites back.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The core mechanics use a 2D6, pick highest roll to determine how many characters can activate each turn with characters being able to perform an array of actions.&#10;     Ranged combat is resolved with a 2D6 roll trying to exceed a target number, with enemies in close range being permitted to return fire.&#10;     Physical injury, squad casualties and morale is all merged into a single damage score, which can be reduced through the use of certain actions. This allows a fast-playing but tactical feeling experience.&#10;     Mechanics are included for stealth missions, spells and more.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The rules are intended for solo play and are stand-alone. You do not need a copy of Chrome Hammer or Squad Hammer to play.  &#10;     The intended play space is roughly 3 x 3 feet though smaller tables are manageable. &#10;     Game scale is agnostic but will play fine in both 15mm and 28mm+. &#10;     Record sheets are included. &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The new games include a devious abstract strategy game (Oasis), a crazy version of Senet in which you move both forward and backward on every turn, and can move not only the pawns but also the spaces on the board itself (Sand), an ultra fast and exciting push-your-luck game that plays in under 5 minutes (Caravan), and a 4-player multi-species strategy game (Ostriches and Alligators).  The ancient games include the Royal Game of Ur, the Advanced Game of Ur, Senet, and Aseb.&#10;&#10;All games are played on a modular wooden gameboard into which different tiles are inserted in a different pattern for each game.  Some games make use of a modular &quot;board extension&quot; that consists of an extra two spaces for tiles.  Most of the games make use of throwing sticks as randomizers, though one game, Oasis, involves no luck at all.  Playing pieces include hand-painted wooden discs as well as pawns cast in resin from clay sculptures and then hand painted.&#10;&#10;The Ur Variations is the third and final entry in game designer Zach Horton's &quot;Ancient Games trilogy,&quot; following re-creations of Mehen and Men.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

This game tries to capture that trend.&#10;&#10;Players draw a card that will determine the place of departure and the initial means of transportation (plane, train or car). From that point they move their pawns to other cities that are connected by the same means of transport (for example, if you travel by plane, you can only move to another city with an airport, only if you take 3 or 6 on the die).&#10;&#10;Some cities allow the player to change the mode of transport, in some others players will only arrive with the exact number in the data and in others they will receive a card with penalties or rewards.&#10;&#10;The first player to arrive in Brasilia is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
