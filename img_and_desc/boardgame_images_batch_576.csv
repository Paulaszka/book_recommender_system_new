In the first phase, players play Arsenal cards with numbers ranging from -5 to 5 in value in front of themselves or other players one at a time.  After each player has placed three cards, the three highest non-tied values gain control of a Power Deck.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, the players with Power Decks, which consist of cards representing all the players, vote on a player to take Influence tokens from.  If all three judges pick the same person, that player instead takes three Influence tokens from any players they choose.  If all three judges pick different people, then the judges must each give one Influence token to another player of their choice.  Otherwise, the two judges who picked the same person take one Influence token each from the player they targeted.&#10;&#10;At this point, the Dealer passes the Arsenal deck to the player to their left who deals everyone three cards and play goes back to the first phase.  The game ends when every player has been Dealer for one round.

If the player fulfills one of the three conditions on their card, they may turn it in and take the appropriate number of Influence tokens from any player(s) of their choice.

Abilities represent the inherent skills and characteristics of the colossus. Specials are the unexpected and unique moves which colossi can perform in battle. Attacks and Attack modifiers represent any weapons and ways of fighting that the colossus might have including claws, teeth, horns, laser beams, rockets, atomic breath, a sharp beak, fireballs, etc.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a 1/600 tabletop with no hexes or squares. There are 6 types of terrain: cities, hazardous, wet, high, tricky or industrial parks. Given the huge size of the colossi, these are little more than nuisances to their inexorable advance.&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns broken in 8 phases: Air Strike Planning (determine where they land - random), Orders (draw Orders Cards and assign them to colossi under your command), Movement (move colossi based on Order Card), Ranged Attack (use Ranged Attacks if any), Close Attack (use Close Attacks if any), Tinies (move the human defenders towards closes colossus and attack it), Air Strike Attack (roll for damage on colossi under air strike coordinates), End (remove markers, check if somebody won, etc). The game ends when a side's colossi have all been knocked out or when a scenario's victory conditions are met (the rules come with 6 scenarios)&#10;&#10;Colossus! comes with its own setting called The Zillium Wars which is featured in little snippets across the rules. This story-world has been deliberately left vague and open to the player&rsquo;s imagination. A range of possible colossi are suggested as starting points, but players are free to come up with their own concepts and model them using the cards available... or even invent their own cards!

In the game, foragers pick fruit from trees, fish in lakes, and hunt aurochs in the fields. After collecting these foods, the foragers return to a fire pit, where they &quot;share&quot; their food with the tribe and earn victory points. In addition, the foragers sometimes happen upon tools, which allow them to forage, fish, or hunt more efficiently.  Of course, foragers are not completely altruistic and so they occasionally fight with each other to earn respect. The player who can best optimize their food and tool gathering, while also avoiding or winning skirmishes is the one who eventually earns the tribe leader title.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, depending upon the number of players. In each round, all players simultaneously choose an action card, from a hand of 3 action cards (drawn from a deck of 10) to use for that round. Each action card lists 5 different actions, but a player may only use 4 of those actions each round. Then, in clockwise order, each player performs 1 of the actions on their card until all players have performed 4 actions. Such actions include things like: walking, foraging, eating, discovering, resting, sharing, and picking up a tool.&#10;&#10;When players pick up food, they place it on their tableau, which tracks the food's freshness. At the end of each round, a &quot;spoilage card&quot; is flipped and all players &quot;age&quot; their food (i.e., move them along a food track).  As the food gets older, it does not provide as much energy if eaten.  Also, to score victory points, players must &quot;share&quot; their food before it spoils.

Instead of building the machines in your factory, now you must store the products in the warehouse, which is a very different task. What's more, you must store products of the same type in a group or have them connected by conveyors. These products are both dangerous and extremely heavy, so for safety reasons you must not drag them more than once, and all products of one type must be together. Building conveyors helps to connect similar products.&#10;&#10;You know which products will need to be stored, but you don't know when and in which combinations, so you must anticipate the future by holding different good options for stocking the goods. The pillar in the middle of your warehouse is as annoying as it was in the factory (Fun) halls.&#10;&#10;When your warehouse is finally filled, the game is complete. If each of the six different goods is stored in a single group, you are doing well. For one product that task is easy because you have to store that type of product only once (i.e., 1 tile). The very dangerous product you should place at the wall, and for the mixed product you decide at the end which product type it is. The conveyors should not have dead ends (to the walls or pillar). Each error results in 1 error point, so try to have the fewest errors.&#10;&#10;For a new challenge, the B-sides of the boards get used. The player with the best score on the A-sides gets the hardest difficulty level B-side warehouse, and so on.&#10;&#10;"

The first is party creation.  A party consists of four characters and any followers a player chooses to add.  Each character is created based on one of the hero miniatures the player chose to use.  Heroes are built much like characters in a role-playing game, with attributes, skills, traits and gear.  Among the most often used traits are the follower traits.  Depending on how many trait choices a hero is given a follower can be an assistant or a powerful beast.&#10;&#10;A game begins by players rolling for which of the eight scenarios they will be playing.  Depending on the scenario each player is given a number of terrain points with which they can customize the table.  A game has at least five rounds, at the end of round 5, and each turn after, one of the players will roll to see if the game ends.  At the beginning of each round players roll for initiative.  The player that wins initiative takes his or her turn. During a player's turn each member of his or her party may take one action.  Examples of actions include Sprint, Charge, Cast a Spell, and Searching Terrain. Searching, combat and some hero traits give a party victory points, the party with the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Finally, once a game has come to an end players roll to determine the treasure they have picked up, if any of their miniatures take permanent injuries, and collect experience for their heroes.  Once all that is settled players take turns having a miniature in their party take an out of game action.  Examples of out of game action include selling unwanted items, creating items, ritual spells and completing quests found during game play.  Completing quests, winning games, hoarding treasure and a few other actions adds to a party's legacy.&#10;Legacy is the ultimate determining factor in winning a campaign.&#10;&#10;"

Firing a burst means you compare the relative fire position cards, roll one die, modify the roll by the plane's firepower modifier, and check the Fire Combat Table to see if you cause any damage (and/or critical hits) to the enemy.  (And watch out for those rear firing gunners.)&#10;&#10;If you find yourself damaged or out of ammunition, you can always try and disengage.  When the deck of cards is exhausted, the game is over.

During the 19th century, the game spread in Spain, becoming one of the most popular card games in the country. The name of the game was later modified by Spanish speakers, who started calling the game Tute. The game is played with a deck of traditional Spanish playing cards, or naipes, that is very similar to the Italian 40-card deck.&#10;&#10;The classic version of the game is Two-player Tute, while the most played is Tute in Pairs, where four players form two teams. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza (a pile next to a player that contains the cards that the player gets after winning a trick) and by declarations (holding certain combinations of cards). Due to its wide popularity, several variations of the game exist.&#10;&#10;The game is played with a Spanish deck of cards, which is divided into four suits: Oros (coins), Espadas (spades), Copas (cups) and Bastos (clubs). The 8s and 9s of each suit are excluded, leaving forty cards in the deck. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza and from declarations.&#10;&#10;Tute in Pairs is played by four players&mdash;two teams of two players each&mdash;and every player receives ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means that all of the cards in the deck are dealt). The last card to be dealt is shown to the rest of the players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was dealt to. The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.&#10;&#10;One person plays a card, and the player to the right of this person, from the opponent team, plays a card. As with Two-player Tute, if the second player has one or more higher cards of the same suit as the first player's card, one of these must be played. If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played. If the second player does not have any cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played. If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played.&#10;&#10;Now, the next player to the right plays a card following the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or if this is not possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, then if possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays a card following these same rules.&#10;&#10;When all four cards of the trick are on the table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards of the other two suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the declarations are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt at the start of the next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands&#10;&#10;Tute games are played until an established number of game points is reached. Each time one of the competitors wins a round, one point is added to the total score of the player or pair. New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number is reached the player or pair wins.&#10;&#10;The winner (or the pair of winners) of the round is determined by the total of round points each player (or pair) collects. These points are calculated as the sum of card values in baza, bonus points for declarations and the final trick bonus.&#10;&#10;A player (or a pair), who wins at least one trick receives an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed until the end of round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.&#10;&#10;The player, who collected all the four Kings, is entitled to declare tute (all), which automatically ends the round with a collector's victory. Having both King and Knight of the trump suit, one can declare las cuarenta (forty), scoring additional 40 round points. The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte (twenty); it adds 20 round points to the player's score. If possible, a player can declare several combination. In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first. For example, after declaring veinte the player loses right to declare las cuarenta, though declaring another veinte is still allowed. In Two-player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each trick is played, so the player can declare las cuarenta after veinte if the combination is collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock.&#10;&#10;The total of the round points the player (or pair) has gained is calculated as the sum of values of the cards collected in the baza and the values of the declared combinations. The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value of the deck (and thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.&#10;&#10;"

Set in a compelling world struggling to recover from a legendary apocalypse, it features a modular map that changes every game, an innovative season mechanic, and three ways to score victory points.&#10;&#10;The goal of Tymor is to excel in three categories of leadership: Kingdom building, trade, and battle. Throughout the game, players will dispatch their Priests to build and upgrade Settlements, their Merchants to trade in other players' lands, and their Soldiers to claim and defend territory. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is crowned King or Queen of Tymor.&#10;&#10;Tymor's unique season mechanic not only determines the productivity of the players' territory, but their odds of success in battle as well. To prevail in Tymor, you must anticipate the chaotic seasons, outwit your rivals, and build a new kingdom of legend, just as the long dark of the world seems to be lifting at last.&#10;&#10;"

They are inspired by atoms and how many bonds each atom can make by sharing electrons with other atoms - thus the name.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the cards and deal out 7 cards to each player.  Place remaining cards in the center of the table and place the top card face up on the table.  There are three kinds of cards; regular atom cards can make single, double, or triple bonds to other atom cards, for which you get single, double or triple points; noble gas cards do not bond to any cards; ion cards only fit with one other card.  First player looks at the card on the table and at the cards in their hand.&#10;&#10;If their is an oxygen card that can make two single bonds on the table, for example, first player needs to have a card in their hand that can also make a single bond.  This is easy to see by the design of the cards.  If the quality of the lines fit together, you have a bond.  An oxygen is worth 8 points.  If you bond a hydrogen to it, worth 1 point, you would get a total of 8 points for this move.  If this player does not have any single bonding cards, they could also play a noble gas, if they have one.  Neon, for example, would be worth ten points.  They would then put this noble gas card in their winnings stack.  They could also play an ion card.  Sodium, for example, would be worth 11 points, but it would stay on the table.  If NONE of these options is available, they must draw from the deck until they get a card that matches the one up on the table.&#10;&#10;If a player is the last one to place an atom card onto the growing molecule in the middle of the table, meaning their are no more empty slots to bond any cards to, they not only get their points, but they get to keep all the cards in this molecule.   They stack up the cards and put it in their winnings pile, along with noble gasses or ion cards won.  In order to win the ion cards, a player must have the other half of the arrow pictured on the ion card.  They get the points for both cards, and then put them in their stack.  When one player has run out of cards, players add up the points they earned, plus ONE point for each card in their winnings stack.  They then subtract any points left in their hand.  If desired, play up to 200 points, or end the game after all players have had a chance to go first.&#10;&#10;"

This mini-version is distributed free in Poland.&#10;&#10;The world you know no longer exists. There is no government. No army. No civilization. The United States have collapsed. And now, thirty years after the war started, new powers finally try to take control over the ruined country, try to establish a new order, try to control others and create a new country, a new State: the 51st State.&#10;&#10;In standard 51st State there are 110 cards and many tokens. In this free demo version, there are only 40 cards. The game is playable for two players and presents the mechanics of the full version.&#10;&#10;In this version players control one of the two powers (New York or Mutants Union) and try to build their very own new country. Players put new locations into the game, they hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.&#10;&#10;Every card can be put into play in three different ways. You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your State so you can use its skill. One card, three possibilities. Lots of decisions and choices that matter.&#10;&#10;Talia Demo 51.

In the basic included scenario, players are locked inside of the mall and searching for keys to unlock a door and a radio that will allow them to call for help and be rescued.&#10;&#10;Zombie Mall can be played as a cooperative game, with all players working together toward the end goal of being rescued.  Zombie Mall may also be played where it&rsquo;s every man for himself (sometimes you have to sacrifice a friend to keep from becoming zombie food).&#10;&#10;While searching the mall, players will come across Loot (random items &amp; events) and will find Objectives (hopefully one of those keys that will unlock something important, but possibly something not helpful &ndash; such as a swarm of hiding zombies).&#10;&#10;That mall map is constructed from Map Tiles which may be configured differently each time you play Zombie Mall.  Sample layouts are shown in Sample Tile Layouts.  The size of your mall directly affects the difficulty, as larger malls will take longer to search and increase the odds of running into hordes of hungry zombies.&#10;&#10;One thing that makes Zombie Mall different from many other games in the zombie genre is that players aren&rsquo;t forced to constantly scrounge for weapons.  Basic combat takes into account that players are grabbing whatever is handy and using everything possible as a weapon.  In addition, the players are not treated as ninja trained since childhood, so those randomly grabbed items are more than likely thrown or lodged into a zombie when used.  There are weapons to be found, but the odds are good that a given weapon won&rsquo;t be durable for more than a couple of uses.&#10;&#10;"

American presidents continue to refer to the Soviet Union as the &quot;evil empire&quot;, and the Cold War lingers on a thousand fronts throughout the world&mdash;from tiny tropical states to the headquarters of the intelligence agencies. Almost without warning, the next armed conflict erupts in the Arab East, at the center of the world's power depot. And this time, the fight is not only for how a small Persian Gulf country will live &ndash; as a socialist or capitalist state &ndash; but rather much more is at stake: control of the world's largest oil reserves!&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of The Hot War: Battle for Oil, a fascinating board game with miniatures based on Konstantin Krivenko's unique war gaming system Art of Tactic. This game puts you in command of modern troops and the powerful equipment of war in battles fought with state-of-the-art technology; it's also the first foray for the Art of Tactic system into a desert theater of operations, allowing players to explore any historical battle from the Africa campaign of Rommel to the Iraq War!&#10;&#10;The Hot War: Battle for Oil starter set includes everything you need to create the first armed conflicts between the Soviet and American armies. Each side is represented by seven units: three motorized infantry platoons, two APCs, one tank, and one helicopter each. Motorized infantry units can be further customized and reinforced by machine guns, anti-tank missiles, and air defense systems. Before each battle, the commanders must choose where to position their reinforcements: Should you spread them out among your platoons, or attach everything together into one overstrengthed unit?&#10;&#10;Like all Art of Tactic games, The Hot War: Battle for Oil uses specially-designed laminated cards for every unit. Each unique unit card displays all of the information a commander needs to use it in the field. The laminated coating allows players to write their orders directly on the unit card, easily cleaning them again before the next round. Players don't take turns, but instead simultaneously plot secret orders to their forces, then resolve them at the same time!&#10;&#10;"

If the diggers manage to find the gold hidden under one of the goal cards, then the diggers share the loot found there; if the gold can't be reached before the deck runs out, the saboteurs profit instead. After three rounds, the player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;This version of Saboteur includes the base game plus additional role cards (the boss, profiteers, geologists), new action cards (steal gold, change your role), and new tunnel cards featuring doors, ladders and bridges. What's more, the gold seekers can now be divided into teams &mdash; blue vs. green &mdash; and only those on the team that finds the gold score anything &mdash; assuming that anyone finds the gold at all, of course...&#10;&#10;"
