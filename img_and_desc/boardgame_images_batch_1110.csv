During the trick-taking phase, players who play off-suit to a trick will take their cards back and they are placed into that player's hand for the next phase; the winner takes the remaining cards into their hand for the next phase. Some cards have special effects and the winner of each trick obtains a yellow cube.&#10;&#10;If a player collected no cards for their millionaire hand, the game ends prematurely.  Otherwise, the players take their new hands and play a climbing game. The following possibilities are intricate, due to the game's card distribution and two-suit nature.&#10;&#10;The game has a number of unique elements.  For instance:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The start player of each trick (for both halves) can choose the direction of play for each trick.&#10;    In the millionaire phase, players can only play a single card until &quot;energy bundles&quot; are created.  These go into a central pool and can be spent by any lead player to trigger a round of playing pairs, triple, etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The lowest caste of all underdogs sits in the Shinjuku honky-tonk as they do every night after work, digesting their lost time. Delirious thoughts waft through cesspools, spilling into an endless nirvana of drunken stupor and hubris. The only fixed point of their blank stares is the smudged cup with the stomach ulcering mixed drinks of Don&rsquo;t Ask and Definitely Don&rsquo;t Ask. A hot, stuffy, yet wild vibe drools through the humid air. It drools saliva that the divers inhale and excrete again as armpit sweat.&#10;&#10;The divers brag about their precious finds from Tokyo's sewers. In drunkenness, yellow slime hardens into gold ingots and rat poison mutates into cocaine. Or was there really a giant diamond that a courier frantically shat out shortly before the raid?

And did he really exist, that mummified politician Tanaka slurs about every night?&#10;&#10;Two to four players get up close and personal with the secret society of Poo Divers. Take part in their stuffy discoveries and, like them, rejoice in every bit of dirt. In this world, all finds have equal value.

Dust allows warping of time, but also has disastrous side effects. Most of the town has now succumbed to the corruption. Only your small posse is left. You need to score a winning poker hand (to buy a ticket on the Wagon out of town). However, spectral forces, tentacles from the deep, and raging fires are not going to make this task easy. Can you escape Reckoning?&#10;&#10;This is a solo, thematic hand-management game set in the weird west as things are about to go down.&#10;&#10;"
