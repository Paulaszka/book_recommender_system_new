We have also further enhanced the game systems and weapon values to make them fully consistent with the new systems seen in Phantom Leader.&#10;&#10;Hornet Leader spans all aspects of US naval aviation throughout the service life of the F/A-18 Hornet from 1983 to the present day.&#10;&#10;The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Navy strike aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.&#10;&#10;A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Campaigns included are:&#10;&#10;     Libya 1984&#10;     North Atlantic WWIII 1986&#10;     Iraq 1991&#10;     Israeli Defense 2001&#10;     Syria 2004&#10;     Taiwan Defense 2008&#10;     North Korea 2011&#10;     Iran 2014&#10;&#10;&#10;See also: Leader series games by Dan Verssen&#10;&#10;"

The set contains 100 cards (90 photos, 6 jokers, 4 blancs), 4 cards with suggestions for words, 1 booklet with rules and examples.&#10;The principal mechanism is very simple: You form compounds by combining the words that you associate with two or more photos. A photo doesn&rsquo;t represent only one word. For instance, for the photo that shows an eagle you can also say &quot;bird&quot;, or &quot;beak&quot;, or &quot;head&quot;, or &quot;feather&quot;, or &quot;claw&quot;, or &quot;animal&quot; and so on. Thus, in combination with other cards in the set, you can form numerous words such as &quot;bird bath&quot;, &quot;bird table&quot;, &quot;frigate bird&quot;, &quot;game bird&quot;, &quot;pack animal&quot;, &quot;stuffed animal&quot;, &quot;animal farm&quot;, &quot;animal world&quot; and so on.&#10;The games can be played on all language levels. The selection of the photos ensures that you can form a large number of compounds within the range of basic vocabulary. Also, you can extend the linguistic range deliberately in terms of code, style and special languages.&#10;In educational contexts the games cannot only be used for vocabulary training. It is also possible to train more subtle competences such as abstract thinking (eagle &gt; bird &gt; animal), the perception of paralleles and differences (bird: bird of prey vs. singing bird), style and narrating (you put down one card after another and let narrate / narrate yourself).&#10;You can play most of the games either in competition or in coordination. Some of the games you can even play on your own. Depending on which game is played, the emphasis is on speed, concentration, memory, or wit. All the games are a challenge to imagination.&#10;The games are suited for cross-generational, highly communicative playing within the family. They have also been designed for educational and therapeutical purposes. (End of text by the publisher)&#10;&#10;"

By cleverly positioning these guests (and by manipulating the guests of your opponents), you'll vie for the attention of Venice's elite guild masters, ensuring the most political power for your family.&#10;&#10;Gameplay revolves chiefly around the clever use of guest cards with varying levels of influence. Each player receives a hand of guest cards, and each guest card has an influence value and its own power, e.g., the peddler, the assasin and the gondolier. The higher the influence, the greater that guest's clout at court. Each player's hand consists of a mix of cards representing members of any of the families currently in play. Use a rival family's guest cards against them, and watch for chances to set up your own house for success.&#10;&#10;Each of the rooms of the Doge's palace offer tokens representing a guild's favor or valuable ducats to be won by ambitious nobles. The spaces between each card that represents a room in the palace are the hallways of the Doge's estate &ndash; the areas in which guest cards are placed to compete for adjacent resources.&#10;&#10;"
