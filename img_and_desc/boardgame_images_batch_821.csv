The player will control Friendly forces and attempt to complete a scenario against enemy forces that are controlled by the game system. At the start of each turn the player will play 1 card from their hand to the Initiative track. This card will determine the initiative values for each of the player&rsquo;s friendly teams and may have other effects depending on the card. After this the player will assign orders to each character on his side. This will determine the actions that the character can take this turn. Once all of the friendly characters have orders assigned to them the player will draw an Enemy AI Card for each enemy team with alerted characters on the board. These cards will determine the Initiative value for each enemy character and the Order that they will receive. The Order determines the actions that an Enemy Character will take that turn.&#10;The game turn is then played through in 4 Impulses. From the lowest initiative value to the highest each Character (Friendly and Enemy) each Character will perform the action specified on their Order counter. All Characters will act on Impulse 1 before moving to Impulse 2, then Impulse 3 and finally Impulse 4. At the end of the turn all Orders are removed and the played cards returned to the respective decks.&#10;&#10;With multiple maps and nearly a 800 counters Combat! will keep you entertained for years to come.&#10;&#10;There was a counter printing problem in the first copies, but that was corrected with replacements long ago; any copy you buy should have correct countersheets.&#10;&#10;"

The first is Group Building, where the player picks from four different dwarf classes and builds groups of nine to use in combat. Each of these different classes has things they are good at and things they are weak at, so it's important to build the groups based on the map objectives and personal play style.&#10;&#10;The second is the actual combat, which is determined by rolling dice according to both the actions that are chosen for the groups and the relevant stat value (Armor, Dexterity, Strength, Knowledge, and Wisdom). The comparison of the attacking roll and the defending roll is done in a way that is unique to Dwarves with Swords, and makes use of all of the different die sizes that we love.&#10;&#10;Another major component of the combat is Drunkenness. Every point of Drunkenness that the group has increases its combat stats while decreasing its Speed - but if the group reaches a Drunkenness level equal or greater than its Memory, the group Blacks Out and is removed from the board.

Other advantages include starting or stopping game in seconds, quick save/quick load game ability, burst card dealing, quick independent release, and rules storage that doubles as a displayable cheat sheet. The maximum number of players is determined by game boxes used (with  four additional players for each game box).&#10;&#10;In Farmer Olaf, players perform four farming activities to gather green cards with points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Farming activities include sowing and harvesting a field, milking a yak, making wool from alpaca, and making ham from a boar. Each player receives five cards at the start of the game and one card on each subsequent turn. Players try to collect appropriate cards for farming actions. For the most part, there is a shortage of buildings and animals needed for production. This means that in order to increase their chances of winning, a player needs to engage in trade with others. There are no limits of how to structure trades: from traditional 1-1 card exchange to more exotic deals like leasing or deferred payment. The game is carefully balanced as, for example, the best cards are steam machines that can be used only to sow and harvest a field. However, to do that one needs a fertilizer that can be obtained only by cleaning a boar pen or cowshed.&#10;&#10;Simple rules and design (no text and no numbers on cards) allow children aged 5+ to participate in the game when playing with adults.

It was inhabited by a civilization that had extraordinary cultural and technological achievements, especially in architecture and art.&#10;&#10;All that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible if they hadn&rsquo;t been blessed by the gods, who the Atlants honored by building glorious monuments for them. And the gods didn&rsquo;t mind that they weren&rsquo;t the only ones being cherished by the Atlants. Alas, the plan of the gods was not perfect. Things went awry because of the younger generation of the gods.&#10;&#10;Specifically it was Ares, the son of Zeus and Hera, whose actions resulted in the disaster. His wickedness was endless, and the cruelty of his followers and the destruction they caused initiated civil war in the land that had only known peace. The emerged conflict divided both the Atlants and their deities. Before those events, the gods had taken pleasure in watching their folk grow, but then they started to interfere with the people&rsquo;s affairs as well as fight one another. Some of the old gods had predicted that this civilization would eventually collapse due to the ever growing conflict between the deities. Conflict in which people&rsquo;s lives would mean nothing.&#10;&#10;So, they decided to protect their followers by sending numerous visions to their priests or by taking a human form and acting as prophets. They would warn Atlants that the end was nigh and tell them about distant lands that could be their only hope for survival.&#10;&#10;Rage of the gods kept growing until one day the eldest one, Nammu, the creator of the primeval sea, in her despair decided to end the Atlants&rsquo; suffering by sinking the island. With the help of their gods some of the Atlants managed to survive.

You will plow the ocean, exploring the islands and collecting gold coins. Of course, it will not do without battles with other captains! Despite the seeming simplicity, the game has many strategies and options for progress towards victory!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is collecting gold coins. To win, you need to collect more coins than other players.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will travel between islands (you choose your way), fight with other players and, using dice, play different events (good or bad).&#10;&#10;Turn sequence:&#10;&#10;Players turn consists of three phases: moving, battle and event.&#10;&#10;- Moving:&#10;        Move your pawn to any neighboring island (including any starting position). You can move only vertically or horizontally (orthogonally). If another player is already on the island, go to the battle phase. If the coin is on the island, pick it up and put it in front of you, then go to the event phase. If the island has neither a coin nor another player - go to the event phase.&#10;&#10;- Battle:&#10;        If you moved to an island on which another player is already located, it means that you attacked him. Proceed to battle. Each player has three health markers that represent the state of your ship. The battle consists of a series of rounds - attacks. Both players roll one die each. The player, who has less value, gets damaged and turns over one of his health markers. If both players have the same values, the dice are thrown. Attack is repeated until one of the players turns his last, third, health marker - this player lost in this fight. After the end of the battle, the winner takes half of the coins from the loser (rounding up), and the loser returns to his starting position. Players reverse their health markers (repairs the ship). If the losing player does not have a single coin, the winner does not receive anything. This ends your turn.&#10;&#10;- Event:&#10;        The event is played if you moved to an island on which there is no other player. Throw three dice and play the event which corresponds to the rolled dice value. This ends your turn.&#10;&#10;"

Then taking an adjacent flower. Finally taking all isolated flowers from the board (soliflowers; those that don't have orthogonally adjancent flowers).&#10;&#10;Optionally, at the beginning of the turn, the players can execute special actions by 'purchasing' them with 3 flowers of the same colour. Each action can only be executed once during the game:&#10;&#10;- Randomly pick 3 flowers from the game case (don&rsquo;t look), if there are at least 3, and add them to your reserve1.&#10;&#10;- Jump orthogonally (not diagonally) over a peak to a space not occupied by a martian. If there is a flower on it, add it to your reserve. Don&rsquo;t take an adjacent flower!&#10;&#10;- Move diagonally to a space not occupied by a martian (you cannot jump over peaks). If there is a flower on it, add it to your reserve. Don&rsquo;t take an adjacent flower!&#10;&#10;- Pick any flower from the board and add it to your reserve.&#10;&#10;- Swap the positions of your martian and any one peak or planted flower.&#10;&#10;- Swap the positions of any one peak and any one planted flower.&#10;&#10;- Swap the positions of any 2 planted flowers.&#10;&#10;- Move any one planted flower to any empty space of the garden.&#10;&#10;- Move any peak to any empty space of the garden.&#10;&#10;- Pick the wildflower and add it to your reserve. Do not place a black counter on the circle; when this unique wildflower is gone, this special action is unavailable.&#10;&#10;GAME END AND SCORING&#10;&#10;If a player can't move her martian to a space occupied by a flower the game ends.&#10;&#10;To get your score, count the number of flowers of the colour you have the least (consider the 6 colours, even if you don&rsquo;t have flowers of some of them!). The wildflower acts as a wildcard; it can be used as any colour but you have to declare which one before scoring.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest score wins. Ties are broken by the second colour you have the least and so on. If the tie persists play again.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Once you've completed your attacks, you can reveal up to two face-down cards (or just one or none at all) and put them forward and replace them with hand cards. A maximum of 3 cards may be revealed and two cards face down.

Mammoth is a tile laying game that appeals to ages 8 and up. Players place tiles to grow their specific color of flowers and to increase the size of their path as their mammoth moves through the plains. The game has both competitive and co-operative versions of play.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, players place their mammoth to begin a field of colorful flowers. At some point during the game they can also place their other prehistoric mammals to claim a path. Then as they take their turns players place an octagon tile or square tile to increase their color grouping or path.  They can score maximum points placing a tile directly next to their mammoth and growing more color groupings instead of just their own.  The last round starts when the last octagon tile is played. The winner is the player who gained the most points by successfully transforming the barren tundra.&#10;&#10;In the co-op version of the game the players work together to accomplish a random color and path goal.  The players play as scientists planning how they are going to guide their mammoths through the park.  Players discuss what actions they want to take and then reveal the available actions for the turn.  Players then choose their actions without discussion and then complete them in turn order.  If the players succeed in accomplishing their goals and reach a required point total before the last octagon tile is placed, the scientists are successful and have transformed the bleak tundra into a beautiful plain.&#10;&#10;"

Army Guys is meant to be played with minimal accessories - you can play on the floor or on a table; you can use literally anything to make up the battlefield; and you only need a tape measure.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the introduction&#10;&#10;The game is designed primarily for two opponents but does support more players; the game is intended to be quickly learned and rapidly played.  The rules assume (but do not demand) the game will be played with &quot;little green men&quot; plastic figures, and uses a suitable scale for movement.  Forces are purchased with a point-buy system.  Initial placement uses a &quot;hold and drop&quot; method (preferred) to randomize units in a close area.  Play proceeds in alternating turns.  During each turn a player may select five units and execute two actions with each unit.  The game supports only two actions - move and attack.  Attacking units have an &quot;accuracy&quot; value which must beat the defender's &quot;hitability&quot; value - in which case, hits are automatic.  Damage is randomly rolled.  Several types of special movement and terrain are supported.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"
