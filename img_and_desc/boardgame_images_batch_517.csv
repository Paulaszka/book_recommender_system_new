Whether or not you&rsquo;re currently a player or playette, there is more game in this box than in most people&rsquo;s brains. Play it for fun, for training, or for a better social lubricator than alcohol. Like The Game itself, these cards can be used to break the ice and get to know people&mdash;whether strangers or your own partner&mdash;in minutes.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Got Game?&rdquo; is engineered to bring out the fun and attractive qualities in every player. From physical challenges to personality tests to secret conspiracies, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Got Game?&rdquo; has it all. So if you&rsquo;re looking to turn an ordinary night into a memorable adventure, this is the game for you.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;&#10;Players take turns running game (script cards) on each other.

THE LEADER reads a script card aloud to all the players. The script card, for example, can consist of personality tests, fun loaded questions, charade-like questions, handwriting analysis, palm reading, physical challenges, secret conspiracy missions, and more. The players respond to the script card accordingly. The player(s) who win the round receives points. (The script card states how many points the card is worth.) After each script card is completed, the next player going clockwise becomes THE LEADER. The player with the most points after 12 script cards + The Final Challenge wins.&#10;&#10;"

It uses a 4&times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).&#10;&#10;Aim: Score the most points you can, without losing the game by disconnecting a white or a black the others of its kind.&#10;&#10;Setup: The 4&times;4 board starts with the 16 base holes filled as shown to the right.&#10;The game is played from the 3&times;3 level up.  Empty the bag, and put 5 balls of each color (white, black, and red) into the bag.&#10;&#10;Rules: Draw a ball from the bag, and add it to the pyramid according to these rules:  When there are no free spaces on a level, you may place the ball on any edge point of the new level; otherwise, you must push a ball from the side with a new ball.  White and black balls must end up touching others of their kind; red needn&rsquo;t do this.  If a white or black becomes stranded, you lose.  You may not push balls off the pyramid.&#10;&#10;Once the last ball is on the pyramid, you score according to the following:&#10;7 points for a visibly connected path of red from corner to corner; otherwise, red is worthless.&#10;A color (black or white) that is split into separate visible groups is worth the product of the number of balls in each visible group of that color.&#10;A color (black or white) that is in one contiguous visible group is worth negative the number of balls in that visible group.&#10; Random Setup: Start with the two red balls in the corner, then put 11 white and 11 black in the bag.  Spiral clockwise inward from one of the reds, drawing a ball from the bag and adding it to the board.  Now spiral clockwise inward again from the same red, and each time you reach a white or black that is not touching any others of its kind, replace it with the other kind from the bag.  (Apologies for the difficulty in replacing the center four!)  Note:  The base may thus contain more groups than just one white and one black.&#10;After setup, dump the bag, and put the usual 5 white, 5 black, 5 red in the bag to start the game.&#10;When playing with random setup, you should play several games in a row with the same setup, so you can really experience the setup.&#10;&#10;Multi-player Solitaire: Any number of people can compete, as long as each person has a Shibumi set.  If you do a random setup, everyone should copy one random setup, so everyone starts with the same base.  If players can see each others&rsquo; pyramids, each player should draw randomly from her own bag during the game; if players cannot see each others&rsquo; pyramids, you can have one person draw from her bag the whole game, announcing the color drawn, and the other players simply pull out that color and place it.  The latter allows for more pure competition, but the former is often more practical.&#10;&#10;"

121916,,"[GreekGuardians.com]&#10;Theme:&#10;Greece of yesterday was a different place than it is today. The age of Ancient Greece was frought with peril, sacrifice and prayer. To get anything done, people would pray to the gods for favor. To complicate matters, the right prayer had to reach the right deity in order to have any chance at success. It was very confusing and complicated life. To simplify this vast set of choices a Greek everyman or everywoman would face, I have chosen two paths that you and your opponents must set your sights towards. Order and Chaos, both are neutral, they are not bad or good in the classical sense, but rather a point of view. By the end of the first players turn, each player must align with Order or Chaos and build their strategies and play their cards towards that means.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;Each player draws cards that move players towards your final goal of 21 culture points. Each action, each king, queen, god, monster, philosopher, literally each card can either add or subtract culture points, cause mayhem, deny abilities, outright kill foes, or otherwise meddle towards your cause or to take an opponent away from their cause, for your chosen faction (Order or Chaos). There is one initial turn to set up and identify which faction, Chaos or Order, you will be gaining points towards and then there are 4 turns, one per season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. If a player does not reach 21 culture points, at the final play of Winter, the player with the highest amount of culture points WINS!&#10;&#10;Game-Play:&#10;Players will determine who goes first and will draw (and play) cards in the correct slots (Gods, Titans, Stars, etc.) and each card will have passive and active effects that resolve at the end of each player's turn. There is a (normal sheet of paper size) game board that shows where different cards &quot;live&quot; Passive effects will usually be &quot;Add one culture point towards either Order or Chaos&quot; (depending on the Card's Alignment). Active effects (or action cards) will require using action points (each player gets 5 action points per turn; the game has 4 turns total, so each play and card management is very important) that can alter the landscape of the game and change fates FAST.&#10;&#10;Unique Feature (Stacking):&#10;Say a certain God card is played (let's say Zeus) and he is Chaos aligned. And say there is a chaos aligned star already in its slot and another chaos aligned Titan in her slot. There is a bonus, or stacking, effect of having a bunch of &quot;like-minded&quot; cards, so this combination of three cards (each say producing one chaos token for this turn, 1+1+1=3) there would be a +2 chaos bonus. So if the player can navigate the correct stacking of &quot;like-minded&quot; or similarly aligned cards, there are bonus effects that can speed up your plan (OR slow down opponents).&#10;&#10;"

Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!&#10;&#10;Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you're lucky, you'll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It's all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.&#10;&#10;You'll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You'll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.&#10;&#10;If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship's cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.&#10;&#10;In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you've angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.&#10;&#10;As captain of your own skyship, you'll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.&#10;&#10;"

Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is easily differentiated, it provides the teacher or parent with flexibility to adjust the game to each student&rsquo;s level.  A teacher can easily raise or lower the ability level of the game by choosing different numbers with which the student(s) can work.  It allows for individual use, small group and whole class learning experiences.  The game can teach students in small groups and as a whole class to work collaboratively and cooperatively, encouraging team work within the classroom.&#10;&#10;Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is a mental math game, it gives students the opportunity to think and solve equations in order to achieve success in the game.  Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is not a game where students methodically repeat drills in order to learn their math facts.  Students naturally acquire this ability through the different processes needed in order to complete the solutions.  Students are able to first visualize the numerical operation by the number on the face of the card, then by referring to the different operation signs (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  The game can also allow for tactile bodily/kinesthetic engagement as students move the cards or touch the cards while working through their solutions.  Students inherently begin to acquire the knowledge of multiplication and division through their repetitive use of the numbers to consecutively count the sheep in the game.  When students achieve a solution, they reinforce their newly acquired skills and the other students participating in the game also hear the repetition of the mathematical equation, which provides reinforcement of the necessary math skills needed for students to be successful in math.&#10;&#10;Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia appeals to students because it is purposely sized to fit in small hands.  It does not have the look or feel of flashcards, allowing students to feel like they are always playing a game instead of doing school or homework.  But because they are instantly and continuously engaged, they are learning while having fun.  The developers purposely designed the game so students never feel as though they are going through math drills, and as students achieve their goals to win the game, the teacher or parent wins because the students have learned and practiced their math facts and order of operations while playing the game.  Even reluctant math students get hooked on Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia because each hand begins very easily, and players are fully involved in &ldquo;playing a game&rdquo; before the more challenging aspects of math kick in.

Delicious mushrooms beckon from every grove and hollow. Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saut&eacute; them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.&#10;&#10;Morels, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms &ndash; sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough &ndash; earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.&#10;&#10;Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.&#10;&#10;"
