The first player to return home with a jar 'o ant eggs wins.&#10;&#10;The ant eggs are provided by the nabour &quot;Herr Padda&quot; (Mr Toad). When getting there you are just half way through, as you have to get back through all the dangers again.&#10;&#10;When leaping along the board the players may get &quot;Hoppakort&quot; (Jump cards). These cards may provide extra leaps, or perhaps some bad luck for you. But more important they can make a change of the weather. The weather guids the amound of leaps every frog may take in each turn until there is another change in the weather. Bad weather such as rain and mist will give you a slower pace. Nice and shiny weather will provide the frogs a quicker move towards the aim of delivering the ant eggs.&#10;&#10;"

In keeping with the pace of the sport of hockey this game uses double-sided Fast Action Cards (FAC) to move the game right along.&#10;&#10;From the first face off players will perform on the ice like no other simulation out there.  Skater&rsquo;s cards are broken down with four separate offensive columns based on whether your team is at even strength, in the power play, shorthanded or the column for rebounds and great feed passes.  These cards don&rsquo;t just tell you whether a player takes a shot but the quality of the shot as well.  Some guys will be shooting at the twine with quality shots most of the time while others will just be putting the puck towards the net.  The slick-passing skaters are not left out here as a good play maker on the ice can set up much higher shooting opportunities.   Players are also rated on the frequency of giving away the puck.  In ITC a bone-headed pass that loses the puck isn&rsquo;t just a turnover it can be a chance for a breakaway for the opposition.&#10;&#10;Defense is covered equally in depth with four separate defensive ratings to set players apart.  The ability to takeaway the puck, block shots, check players off the puck and a general defensive ability all can force the action of the offense.  You will be able to &ldquo;see&rdquo; a great defensive play stop a would be shot.  Blocking a shot or forcing a shot wide with a defensive stop can be a goal saver.  Controlling loose pucks can be a real game turner in ITC with this ability captured in the ratings as well.&#10;&#10;No hockey game would be complete without the ability to capture the penalty aspect.  In ITC the players are not just rated for penalty frequency but the type as well.  Whether it be a minor, major or misconduct you will know when it happens.  If a fight breaks out you will watch the two combatants head to the box.  When a minor is called you will get an actual penalty name (elbowing, holding, etc) for added flavor.&#10;&#10;The goalies are created with the ability to stop shots in the six different shooting categories.  You will be crushed to watch a weak slapshot trickle through for a goal but be ecstatic watching your goalie thwart an excellent scoring opportunity.  In ITC the  ability of the goalie to control the action after a shot is also taken into consideration.  You will see your goalie simply give up a rebound shot, hold the puck or be able to pass it off to a teammate.&#10;&#10;If strategy is your game ITC delivers with a simple and unobtrusive way to handle your coaching choices.  If you push more forecheckers up the ice for better scoring chances you are leaving yourself open on the back end.  It is your choice how to play it.&#10;&#10;"

In addition, each player chooses one of five alignments (moderate or conservative Republican, Independent, moderate or liberal Democrat), and secretly chooses up to 6 of the 15 available issues. The 30 issue tiles are shuffled and 3 placed randomly on each side of the board (region): North, East, South and West. The track around the board has a variety of plus or minus spaces, but six out of 10 spaces on each side are blank and trigger auctions.&#10;&#10;The player landing on the space can put any unclaimed state in his current region up for auction. Bids are secret and paid in Political Capital (PC), the game&rsquo;s currency, and players pay their bids whether they win or lose the auction! After their bids are revealed, they are modified by regional issue matches (1/3 = 5 PC; 2/3 = 10 PC; 3/3 = 20 PC) and any card bonuses. Finally, all players roll dice that depend on their affiliations and the state&rsquo;s preference. (A pink state gives 3 extra D6 to a moderate democrat, 2D6 to a liberal democrat, 1D6 to an Independent, and nothing to Republicans.) The highest total then wins the auction.&#10;&#10;While issues help in some states, taking fewer stands allows a player to collect more PC for each circuit of the board. As soon as a Republican and Democratic candidate reach 5 states with 50+ electoral votes, they win the party nomination, and other players in the party either drop out or become independents. Three scenarios are available: full campaign to electoral vote majority; most electoral votes after one time through the Momentum card deck; or a short game won by the first player to win at least one state in every region with at least 50 electoral votes.&#10;&#10;"
