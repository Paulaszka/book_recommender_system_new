39471,,"According to Mancala World:&#10;&#10;Cenne (literally &quot;beautiful&quot; in Tulu) is a mancala game of the Tuluva in Southern India with several unusual game mechanisms, some of which remind of the totally unrelated Ethiopian game of Lamlameta. It was first described in 1986 by the ethnologue Peter J. Claus, professor at the State University of California at Hayward (USA).&#10;&#10;The game plays an important role in the Siri cult of South Kanara. It is prohibited to play the game after the rice seedlings (neji) are in the growing fields and up to harvest time. There is an old custom in the Bant caste of playing the game by the male head's of the boy's and girl's families during the marriage negotiation ceremonies (niscaya). It is regarded a good omen if the girl's party loses. The game is also often associated in Siri legends. Another prohibition is to lend out the board overnight and gambling. More prohibitions concern the players. Sisters are not permitted to play the game together (not even classificatory sisters, e.g. a woman with her husband's sister), nor are brothers (including classificatory brothers, e.g. mother's brother and sister's son), nor husband and wife. The game is not normally played among men except in association with marriage alliance. The social prohibitions coincide with an asymmetrical relationship within families characterized by potential feelings of jealousy, competition, aggression and self-interest which could destroy the strength and unity of a matrilineal family.&#10;&#10;The Cenne board is usually made from hard, dense wood such as rosewood or ebony. The counters are the small seeds of the arnotto tree (Bixa orellana), the coral tree (Erythrina caffra) or cowrie shells.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board called mane has 14 holes (variously called guri (&quot;pit&quot;), illu (&quot;house&quot;) or kone (&quot;room&quot;)) arranged in two rows and two larger hollows at either end used for storing captured seeds. Each player owns the store to his right.&#10;&#10;Initially there are four seeds (parelu or kayi) in each hole.&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes in the ensuing holes, one by one, in a counterclockwise direction.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into an occupied hole, its contents are lifted for another lap.&#10;&#10;During a move a seed may not be dropped into a hole containing three seeds (called murte) unless the player has just one seed seed in his hand.&#10;&#10;In rare circumstances all holes may have three seeds. If the player still has one or several seeds in hand, he puts these in the hole to his far right (called atappe (&quot;heap&quot;)) without capturing them. The opponent then takes the three seeds from his heap and drops one of them in his opponent's heap, another one in that hole from which he removed the seeds and the last one in the next adjacent hole on his side, giving it four seeds, which he then captures, thus ending the move.&#10;&#10;This seed, which would become a singleton, is called jeppe (&quot;sleeper&quot;) and may not be used to begin the next turn.&#10;&#10;If the last seed in hand is placed into a murte, its contents becomes wanasu (&quot;meal&quot;), that is, all four seeds are captured and put in the player's store.&#10;&#10;Afterwards the player continues his move by distributing the seeds of the following hole.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last seed is placed in an empty hole, when the hole following a wanasu is empty or after an atappe play.&#10;&#10;The game is played until a player can demonstrate at his turn that in four consecutive draws he does not have to place a seed in one of his opponent's holes. That player wins the seeds that are still remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;The player who captured more groups of four has won the round.&#10;&#10;The successive rounds are played by filling the holes on the player's side with his winnings. Holes that cannot be filled are not used in the next round. It is possible, albeit difficult, to reconquer lost holes. Seeds that are not used in the round are stored as if they were captures.&#10;&#10;The game is over when at the beginning of a round a player can fill less than four holes. The phrase to claim victory is poli maipunu (&quot;plunder&quot;).&#10;&#10;"

The game of warriors, which is never played by woman, is usually played by teams of eight. &#10;It is said that the game was invented by Sindillo, the son of the first man, Maitoumbe, when he was an old man. According to a legend, he also discovered honey which then became a food of the Masai. The first European to describe En Geh&eacute; was the German Moritz Merker of the Imperial Protection Troops (Kaiserliche Schutztruppe) of German East Africa in 1904. He is also regarded to be the first ethnologue of the Masai.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a board which consists of two rows of 40 - 50 holes each. The holes (sing.: en gurt&oacute;to; pl.: 'n gurt&oacute;t) are dug into the ground. Each team controls one row (sing.: ol m&aacute;tua; pl.: el m&aacute;tuan). &#10;Each hole contains at the beginning four counters (sing.: os soid; l.: es soido). The Masai take small pebbles or seeds of the ol gulangulu (Caesalpinia bonduc). Depending on the size of the board 320 - 400 counters are needed.&#10;&#10;At his turn a member of the team picks up the contents of a hole and distributes the stones (or seeds), one by one, in counterclockwise direction into the succeeding holes. &#10;If the last stone falls into a non-empty hole, its contents are distributed in another lap. &#10;The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole. &#10;If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole of the team's own row, the contents of the opposite enemy hole are captured. If anything was captured, then the stone which caused the capture is also taken. &#10;The game ends when one team can't move. &#10;The stones which are still left on the board, are captured by the team which could move last. &#10;The team who captured more stones wins the game. &#10;If both teams captured the same number of stones, the game is a draw.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

It was a popular pastime of young boys when they were herding cattle of goats. The game is almost forgotten today. There were special terms for certain moves and various holes, but no one seems to remember them now.&#10;&#10;The board was usually dug into the ground. The game was played with small pebbles or the seeds of the mubuthi tree (Caesalpinia volkensii).&#10;&#10;Giuthi was first described in 1925 by the English ethnologue Orde Brown in his book The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Giuthi is played on two-rank boards numbering from five to ten holes per row.&#10;&#10;The number of stones in each pit varies from four to nine. Four is preferred on the smallest boards, six on the medium-sized ones and eight on the larger boards. Nine stones per hole on a two-by-ten board gives the first player a big advantage and could therefore be regarded as a kind of handicap when two players of unequal strength are playing.&#10;&#10;Each turn starts with a hole that contains at least two seeds.&#10;&#10;The seeds are either distributed in the clockwise or the counterclockwise direction into the succeeding holes in the first lap of a move.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last seed) are distributed in another lap in the opposite direction.&#10;&#10;If the last seeds falls into an empty hole of your own side, the player moves again, unless he has placed at least one seed into an enemy hole during this move.&#10;&#10;If the last seeds falls in one of your empty holes and you have played into the opponent's territory (see proverb (bottom)), then you capture the seeds in the enemy hole just across and the last seed that was distributed.&#10;&#10;If this empty hole is followed in an unbroken chain by more empty holes on your side, then the seeds in the opposite holes are also captured.&#10;&#10;When the last seed falls into an empty hole of your oponent, the turn is over.&#10;&#10;A player must move if he can. He must pass, if he can't, but must move again, if he has something to play with.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no longer any moves can be made or when the board position repeats.&#10;&#10;Each player scores as many points as he has captured seeds and as he has seeds in his holes at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player who has more points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;The following board sizes were recorded by ethnologues: &#10;&#10;     2 x 5 holes. Number of seeds not given. &#10;     2 x 6 holes with 4 seeds per hole. For beginners. &#10;     2 x 7 holes with 6 seeds per hole. According to Driedger a typical starting arrangment among the Kikuyu. &#10;     2 x 8 holes with 4 seeds per hole. Said to be the most popular variant when played on a casual basis. &#10;     2 x 10 holes with 9 seeds per hole. Quite unbalanced - the first player can capture 10 seeds in the first turn without being threatened in the next. &#10;&#10;&#10;The most challenging variant that is well balanced is played on a 2x10 board with 8 seeds per hole.&#10;&#10;Giuthi proverb:&#10;&#10;You can't steal the cattle of another man without entering his land!&quot;&#10;&#10;"

They live in one of the least accessible areas of Ethiopia and many of them are heavily armed with guns.&#10;&#10;The game is a recreation of adult males who play in the shade of trees. The board is dug in the ground.&#10;&#10;Huroy was first recorded by the British anthropologist David Turton in the early 1970s who was the first European to visit them. At this time the Mursi didn't even know that they live in a country called Ethiopia.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The game is played on a two-row board of six holes (holog, pl. hologunya) per row. One end of the board is called saba (&quot;head&quot;), the other end karenni (&quot;downstream&quot;). Initially each hole contains four stones (be, pl. benna, also known as benna huroin = &quot;huroy stones&quot;).&#10;&#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one by one into the ensuing holes. The move ends after a single lap.&#10;&#10;If, at the start of his turn, a player has a singleton and the opponent's opposite hole is occupied, he captures the contents of both these holes. Note that a capture is not effected by alighting in an empty hole.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has nothing to move with. The remaining stones are won by the player who moved last.&#10;&#10;The player who has captured more stones wins the game. Winning a game is referred to as &quot;driving a cow&quot;.&#10;&#10;Players try to achieve 10 victories called katog uli (&quot;I drive a bull.&quot;).&#10;&#10;Huroy Sayings&#10;&#10;If a player places his penultimalte stone into his last hole of the saba end and the last stone into the opposite hole, he might say karag saba (&quot;I hit the head.&quot;). At the other end of the board he says karag karenni (&quot;I hit downstream.&quot;).&#10;&#10;If a player captures just a single stone from an opponent's hole, he would say kamati lili (&quot;I am eating two holes opposite each other.&quot;). If he captures more, he would remark kamati uro (&quot;I am drinking milk.&quot;).&#10;&#10;"

39479,,"Isolo (according to Kalumbete also called isumbi) is the name given to three related mancala games played by the Sukuma, in Tanzania. This is the more simple one, the &quot;women's game&quot; (in fact, the girls' game).&#10;&#10;The game begins with 2 seeds per hole. (In a 4x8 grid of holes with one of the longer sides facing each player.) On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. &#10;Each player controls the two rows closer to her. &#10;Moves are multiple lap. &#10;On her turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on her side and sows them one by one on the following holes on her side, on a counterclockwise sense. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture she takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and on the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds she captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. &#10;If on her turn a player can not move (she has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) she has lost the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;That is the basic game. An intermediate form is:&#10;&#10;&quot;This is the middle (according to difficulty) one, the &quot;boys' game&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game begins with a special position&quot; Thesame board as the above but with a non-uniform starting position. 17 seeds start in the pit at the bottom right corner for each player. The adjacent pit in the same row starts with 2 seeds as does each other pit in the same row thereafter. In the middle two rows, pits with an empty pit behind them (i.e., closer to the nearer player) start with 2 seeds and the hole diagonally next to the corner starts wth 1 seed on each side. Other pits start empty.&#10;&#10;&quot;On the first game the beginning player is chosen at random. On the following games, it alternates. &#10;Each player controls the two rows closer to him. &#10;General rules&#10;General rules are as those of women's game. &#10;Moves are multiple lap. &#10;On his turn the player takes all the seeds from a hole on his side and sows them one by one on the following holes on his side, on a counterclockwise sense. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in an empty hole the move ends. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole not allowing a capture he takes all the seeds on this hole and keeps on sowing another lap. &#10;If the last seed of a lap is sown in a hole of the inner row and in the opponent's facing holes there are any seeds he captures them and sows them in another lap starting on the same hole the capturing lap started. &#10;If on his turn a player can not move (he has no seeds, or all of them are singletons) he has lost the game. &#10;Overture&#10;At the beginning of the game some special rules apply. &#10;Both pits containing 17 seeds are called ng'hana (privileged pits). &#10;During the player's overture (each player overture can last differently) seeds are sowed only on his 14 left most holes, and the contents of the ng'hana can not be captured.&#10;&#10;Once a player decides to (or must, as all other pits are empty or singletons) play the ng'hana his overture is over, he sows the seeds on the full board and all his seeds can be captured, from any pit. However, he can not capture the opponent's ng'hana as far as the opponent is still playing his own overture. &quot;&#10;&#10;"

The game was described by the Dutch mancala researcher Alexander Johan de Voogt during an extensive field study in 1998. The board is usually dug in the earth and the players, mostly adult women and men, are often surrounded by a curious crowd of spectators.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Katro is played on a 6x6-board, a very unusual size for a mancala game. Each player owns one half (upper or lower) of the board.&#10;&#10;Initially there are two stones in each hole.&#10;&#10;You must start your move in the outermost row of your side which has a non-empty hole. Singletons can also be moved.&#10;&#10;Moves are multi-lap. As in four-rank Mancala you only move on your side.&#10;&#10;If the last stone is dropped into a non-empty hole, all contents are picked up and are distributed one by one in the following holes by continuing in the same direction.&#10;&#10;If the last stone of a lap is dropped into a non-empty hole which is directly opposite to a non-empty hole of your opponent, all the contents of his hole are captured. His stones and the contents of your own hole are then distributed in a new lap starting in the next hole on your side. The following conditions must be met to effect a capture:&#10;&#10;&#10;     As long as you have a non-empty hole in your innermost row, you may only capture from your innermost row. When your innermost row is empty you capture from your central row, if this row is also empty, you capture from your outermost row. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     You may only capture opponent's stones from his innermost row as long as there are still non-empty holes. If these holes are all empty you may capture stones from your opponent's central row. If this row is also empty you capture opponent's stones from his outermost row. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game is played in a boustrophedon manner. The direction of play is either (see notation below) abcdefghijklmnopqrfedcbalkj or alkjihgrqponmabcdefgh.&#10;&#10;Notation&#10;&#10;a b c d e f&#10;l k j i h g&#10;m n o p q r&#10;M N O P Q R&#10;L K J I H G&#10;A B C D E F&#10;&#10;Players are not permitted to pass a move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has no move.

Initially there are three seeds (makombo) in each hole.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot capture, he starts his turn by emptying one of his holes and then distributes its contents one by one counterclockwise into the following holes. When he can't capture (see below), he makes a new lap by distributing the contents of the hole following the hole in which he dropped the last seed in hand. The move ends when the last hole is followed by an empty one. It is either possible to capture before the actual move starts or during a move.&#10;&#10;If, at the beginning of a turn, two inner holes (one from each player) opposite to each other contain seeds, the enemy seeds of the opposite hole and, if there are any, of the enemy hole of the same file behind it are picked up and then distributed counterclockwise on the own side. The first seed must be put into the hole which effected the capture. This kind of capturing is compulsory, but the player is free to decide from which holes he captures when he has more than one choice.&#10;&#10;If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole and the following hole is in the inner row and contains seeds, the contents of the opposite enemy hole in the opponent's inner row are captured and also the seeds in the outer enemy hole just behind it. Again, the captured seeds are distributed on the player's own side, starting in the hole which effected the capture (that is, straight opposite the captured holes).&#10;&#10;The player who captures all seeds of his opponent's inner holes is declared winner, no matter how many seeds his opponent still has in his outer row. The game is a draw, if a move doesn't end. Perpetual sowing occurs, for instance, if empty holes alternate with holes containing one seed, when at the beginning of the turn, no two inner holes opposite of each other have seeds.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

39485,,"A manqala game.&#10;&#10;From Wikimanqala:&#10;&#10;http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Um_dyar&#10;&#10;Um dyar (enmediar, manddiar&eacute;, umdiyar, um ed-dyar) is played by the Hassaniya-speaking population in western Mauritania, for instance in Boutilimit (Trarza province) and in Moudj&eacute;ria (Tagant). Hassaniya is an Arab dialect heavily influenced by Tamazigh, a Berber language, that originated in the 15th century. At this time the Yemenite Beni Hassan tribe migrated to north-western Africa and subdued the indigenous Berber tribes over a period of 300 years. Hassaniya is today spoken in the western Sahara, from Niger to Mauritania. They constitute the majority of the population in Mauritania and southern Morocco. The Hassaniya call this region Trab el Bidan, i.e. '&quot;Land of White People&quot;, in contrast to Bilal al Sudan, or &quot;Land of Black People&quot;. &#10;Um dyar is mostly played by young women, sometimes also by men. However, they do never play among themselves, just with women, for instance as a means of courtship. &#10;The game is played all the year, but especially on Ramadan and during the hot hours at noon time. &#10;Usually the holes are dug in the sand, but there are also traditional wooden boards. Some of them are made of one piece, while others consist of two halves. &#10;The holes are called dyar (sing.: dar, i.e. &quot;houses, inhabited places&quot;). The seeds are called ky&eacute;tan (sing.: kyit), probably related to kyit, Hassaniya for &quot;odd&quot;.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;The board is made of two rows of an even number of holes, between 2 and 12. &#10;The number of seeds which are initially in each hole depends on the size of the board. A board which numbers just four holes has four seeds in each hole. Board that have eight or twelve holes have as many seeds as the whole board numbers holes or, alternatively, just as many as one row numbers holes. Large boards which have 16 or 24 holes have initially in each hole as many seeds as a row counts holes.&#10;&#10;Each player controls the holes on his side of the board. &#10;At his turn, a player takes the contents of any hole of his side of the board and sows them counterclocwise, one by one, starting in the very same hole from where he took them. &#10;     If you move a singleton, it is put into the next hole counterclockwise. &#10;If the last seed ends in a hole making a total of an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole, these seeds are captured and removed from the board. &#10;If you have captured, you also get the contents of the preceding holes (in an unbroken sequence) that contain an even number of seeds, not greater than the initial number of seeds per hole. &#10;If a player has no seeds to play with, he passes and his opponent plays again. &#10;The game ends when all seeds are captured. &#10;The player who has captured most seeds, wins the game. &#10;If at the end of the game a single seed remains (i.e. there has been some mistake or cheating), the players who has an odd number of captured seeds loses one seed. These two seeds (the lost one and the seed remaining on the board) are not counted.&#10;&#10;Usually you don't play just a game, but a match. &#10;In the next game you start filling the holes with the captured seeds. &#10;The winner fills all his holes with the standard initial number of seeds. &#10;The loser fills all the holes he can with the standard number of seeds. If he some seeds remain, he puts them in another hole. &#10;     The empty holes on the loser's side of the board are refilled with sand or marked somehow. In the next game you don't play in them. &#10;     If the loser has not enough holes for his seeds, he reopens as many holes as he needs. &#10;     There is no fixed rule about the order to close or reopen the holes. Sometimes they are openend from left to right. However, it is not important. &#10;The winner of the match is who captures all the seeds and leaves the opponent with no holes on his side. &#10;If there was a couple of seeds out of game (as seen above) they are given to the first player who makes a capture in the next game.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

The game was was first described by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 as Game 17. Similar games exist in Western Eritrea and Somalia.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Lahemay waladat is played on a board of two rows of of (sic) six holes. The game starts with four stones in each hole.&#10;&#10;The right to start the game is decided by a hand-play referred to in Tigrinya as shekut. To begin with, the two players are holding hands as in a handshake. After breaking the hold, they would either expose the first finger, last three fingers or the open hand with fingers side by side. A player who displayed his first finger defeats one with three fingers, three fingers defeats the hand, and the hand the first finger. &#10;On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes anti-clockwise, one at a time, into the succeeding holes. &#10;If the last stone is sown into an occupied hole, its contents are distributed in another lap. &#10;The move ends when the last stone falls into an empty hole. &#10;Groups of three stones made during a turn belong to the owner of the row, except a group of three that was effected by the last stone in hand which is won by the player whose hand it was. The latter kind of capture, however, does not terminate the move. The player would continue to move until his last stone in hand is placed in an empty hole (in other words, the player gets a bonus move). &#10;The game ends when a player cannot move at his turn. The remaining stones are won by the player who could move last. &#10;The player who wins more threes wins the round. &#10;For the next round each player fills his holes with four stones from his winnings. If a player has one surplus stone, he cedes it to his opponent who can then together with his own surplus of three stones would open another hole. If each player has a surplus of two stones, their ownership is decided by shekut. Any holes that could not be filled are closed down with sand, but can be re-opened in a later round. &#10;The aim of the game is to close down all the opponent's holes, that is to reduce his provision to less than four stones. &quot;&#10;&#10;Pankhurst, R. 1971.
