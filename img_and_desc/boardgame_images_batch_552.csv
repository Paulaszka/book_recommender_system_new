Players have question cards and risk cards, the starting player chooses a card and the candidate on his left tries to answer the first question - if he is right, the second is asked. In case of two correct answers the candidate receives the card and puts it with his risk cards. If the first answer is wrong, the left neighbour of the candidate can take over by risking one of his risk cards - if he answers wrong he loses the card. At the end the player with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;"

When a new card is selected, another player is dealt a card through a &quot;Gifting&quot; process. Thus, players must choose wisely when they select a card because they may be giving others a good card, too.&#10;&#10;Midway through the game, players score for the humans in their neighborhood &ndash; counting themselves and dividing that number into The Human Alliance (people who reject the alien's attack) and the Neoxenophiliacs (those who embrace the extraterrestrials) &ndash; while also scoring for having the fewest aliens and zombies in their little fiefdoms. Scoring happens again at the end of the game, with the winning player gaining the prestigious role of Governor of Fornia. (Okay, it's not that prestigious.)&#10;&#10;Zomboozle is notable for being the first game with the &quot;Gifting Mechanism&quot;. When you draft a card, someone else gets a card as a result. The location of the card on a tableau or the information on the card might govern how the distribution occurs. This mechanism is in two other proposed games from 3Sided Card.&#10;&#10;"

Straight from the tabloid headlines, these unsolved mysteries, urban legends, and other phenomena are here to be finally solved or debunked by your Investigators.&#10;&#10;Assembling your own teams of Paranormal Investigators (or PI's, for short), players must rely on the diverse backgrounds of their PI&rsquo;s to solve a host of strange Case Files. Once solved, these cases can be saved for the end of the game or used to solve larger cases and gain strategic advantages over your opponent.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with only a couple of Investigators and a handful of Paranormal Aid cards. Each PI has their own unique background in various paranormal fields. Certain PI's also have a &quot;Debunk&quot; background, which allows players to attempt to solve a case by debunking it. Paranormal Aids can be used to add a background to a PI or increase it. Players also have the option of using these aids (as well as any solved cases they have) to enlist additional PI's or perform other actions, such as allowing PI's to add their backgrounds through partnering.&#10;&#10;Players take turns revealing cases on a Case Files card layout and attempting to solve them. These cases cover many paranormal backgrounds (cryptozoology, unexplained phenomenon, supernatural, extraterrestrial, demonic, and cursed) with five levels for each one. Each level needs the equal and matching background to solve it (for example, a Level 5 Supernatural Case File needs a combined Supernatural background of 5 to solve it). Each level on a Case File also equals the number of points it is worth at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;At first, players will only be able to solve a limited number of these cases. But, as they enlist more PI's and use their aids/solved cases, players will slowly be able to solve larger ones. While the larger cases are worth the most towards victory, they also have powerful secondary abilities (like abducting an opponent's PI or stealing one of their solved cases). Players must weigh their options when doing this since cases that have their secondary abilities used are discarded and can't be added to a player's end game total.&#10;&#10;The player that does the best job of building their team of Paranormal Investigators and managing the most strategic use of their Paranormal Aids and solved Case Files will end the game with the largest number of combined Case File points and be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

There are three types of Dang It - the first has the numbers 1 &amp; 6 coloured differently, the second has the 2 &amp; 5 and the third has 3 &amp; 4 in a different colour.&#10;&#10;With them you can play the game 'Dang'. 'Dang' is a push your luck game played over 10 rounds. At the start of each round, a card is drawn at random, showing a value of between 9 &amp; 22. On a player's turn, they roll 4 dice, trying to maximise the sum of the white pips before the sum of the black pips exceeds the number on the card. Dice with white pips can be rerolled but those with black must be kept. After each throw, the player chooses to either continue rolling or bank their total, so ending their turn. But if the sum of the black pips exceeds the number on the card, they have bust and score nothing for this round. It's a game that can be taught in minutes and takes no more than 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;But what Dang It Dice also allow you to do is play existing games with them, so creating an interesting slant on the original. For example we've played Yahtzee with them, changing the rules so that dice with black faces count for 2 of that number. Similarly you could play Snakes and Ladders with a single Dang It, moving backwards if the black face falls uppermost. We've also found that they encourage players to invent their own games with them. Thus Dang It Dice are more than just the 15 dice - they are [to coin a well used cliche] a toolkit for your imagination.&#10;&#10;"
