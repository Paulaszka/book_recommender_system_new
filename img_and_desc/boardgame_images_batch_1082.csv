The colonial houses in this historical town are a testimony to its colorful past. You, on the other hand, are more interested in old shipwrecks &mdash; more specifically, sunken Spanish galleons filled with gold. Time to embark on an old-fashioned underwater treasure hunt. What you didn't anticipate is that several of you have discovered the legends of these buried riches. To make matters worse, a barracuda is prowling through the shipwrecks.&#10;&#10;The challenge in Barrakuda is to be the first player to have eight gold pieces in their vault, but before you can lock away gold in your vault, you need to find it on shipwrecks or steal it from others.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out shipwreck cards numbered 1-6 in some orthogonal arrangement, and give each player movement cards numbered 1-5, along with a barracuda card. On a turn, each player chooses a card from their hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If you played a movement card, move your pawn to that shipwreck card; if you're the only player there (and the barracuda isn't), take both the special action and general action listed on the card. If more than one player is on the same shipwreck card, then whoever has the fewest movement cards in front of them has the initiative and can either take the special action or take all the gold from one player's bag; after this, all players take this card's general action.&#10;&#10;If you're the only one who played a barracuda card, roll the distance die, then move it up to that many spaces in the direction of your choice. If a barracuda is on the same space as a player, they have to drop their gold on that shipwreck space; others can pick up that gold starting next turn. If none or more than one player play barracuda, roll the direction and distance card to determine where it goes.&#10;&#10;Actions on cards let you pick up gold, move gold from your bag to your vault, protect you from the barracuda, take back movement cards, move the barracuda, and so on.&#10;&#10;"

They will draw a Ghost Profile card and learn their secret identity before shuffling it with 7 other profile cards and placing them face up on the table in view of all players in a 2 x 4 grid. All the other players will be acting as Mediums looking to be the first to correctly guess the ghost player&rsquo;s identity from among the 8 face up Ghost Profile cards on the table.

The types of s&eacute;ances may require the ghost to knock their answers, use charades, make faces, or use non-verbal sounds to clue the mortal morsels in to their identity. There are limited chances to perform these rituals and if you take too long, the Ghost thinks you're playing games and the round will end.&#10;&#10;When a Medium thinks they know who the Ghost is they can tap the card on the board.  If they tap correctly, they successfully hooked up and both they and the Ghost score a point.  If they tap the wrong Ghost, they have made an awkward misjudgment and won't be able to guess again this round.&#10;&#10;Then the Medium to the left of the Ghost becomes the next Ghost and play continues in this manner until someone has 5 points and is declared the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

If the players guessed the correct ranking everyone wins the round; if not everyone loses.&#10;&#10;EXAMPLE:  &#10;Q: Who would you choose as the drummer in your rock band? &#10;&mdash;Hermione Grainger &#10;&mdash;George Washington &#10;&mdash;Shrek&#10;&#10;Start a new round, reveal three new characters and the next player becomes the Judge.

The game was first owned by a Dublin printer in the 1940s and remained within the same family until 2022.&#10;&#10;Similar to some other wargames of the era, the objective is to capture the enemy&rsquo;s GHQ using a variety of combat units while defending your own GHQ. In WARCHESS the units are comprised of infantry, tanks, artillery, forts (which remain stationary once placed), trucks, and trains. The latter two allow you to move eligible units a greater distance. WARCHESS is played on a game board showing a map of Western Europe with square &ldquo;hexes&rdquo; created using a vertical and horizontal grid.&#10;&#10;Contemporary games to this include Dennis Wheatley&rsquo;s Invasion (1938) and Campaign (1935) by Wills &amp; Hepworth Ltd. Campaign would be the most similar in play, with WARCHESS being more complicated due to the availability of more unit types.&#10;&#10;"
