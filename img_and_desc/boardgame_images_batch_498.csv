The statistics of each character are Grit, Fighting Value, Shooting Value, and Speed.  Several scenarios are given or players can make their own.  There is also a campaign system for linking battles.&#10;&#10;The game turn is split into three phases- movement, shooting, and melee.  The players alternate turns activating all of their figures in each phase.&#10;&#10;"

Have you got what it takes?&#10;&#10;Air Show is a game and a game system. Take the controls of a stunt plane and put your piloting to the test in a variety of aerial events. Manage your altitude and airspeed, perform cool stunts to turn the tables on your opponents, think fast, shoot straight, fly true, and maybe you'll take home the trophy this year.&#10;&#10;This game uses a simultaneous action selection mechanic to program a flight plan three maneuvers in advance. Players have thirty seconds to &quot;lock in&quot; their maneuvers and stake out a position in turn order. When everyone is ready, maneuvers execute in turn order. Planes may dive or climb, turn right or left, accelerate or brake, or perform a stunt at the expense of altitude or airspeed. The goal differs with each event, but strategies emerge from anticipating what other players are doing and planning around that. Unlike other games of this type, such as RoboRally or Wings of War, there are no cards to play. All maneuvers are available to all players at all times, to the limits of what their current altitude and airspeed allow.&#10;&#10;"

Ticonderoga) during the French and Indian War (1755-58). The game system emphasizes the importance of leaders, and highlights the role of individual command skills, circumstances and luck. Throughout the game, leaders&rsquo; skills are tested as their units maneuver and fight, and every leader has the capacity to be &ldquo;inept,&rdquo; &ldquo;capable&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional,&rdquo; varying from engagement to engagement.&#10;&#10;The game includes a lot of randomization; so every game may vary in tempo. One game may involve more soldiers than another, and often the quality of the lower-level (unnamed) leaders will be different. There are three campaign and three raid scenarios, featuring many units for the longer games and fewer for shorter ones (280 counters total). Each hex on the Strategic Map represents 1.5 miles, whereas each hex on the Tactical Map (for the area near Ticonderoga) represents just 400 yards. Individual units represent from 50 to 800 men, and leader chits each represent a single commander, sometimes a famous historical figure, at other times an unknown man of low-rank.&#10;&#10;Designed by William Nester and Eric R.

The game comes with 10 fictional teams, each consisting of 20 fictional players (13 position players and 7 pitchers). Each position player is rated for batting average and power versus both left-handed and right-handed pitchers, plus speed, arm strength, and fielding ability. Each pitcher is rated for opponents' batting average, along with strikeouts and walks against both left-handed and right-handed batters.&#10;&#10;The outcome of an at bat is determined by rolling dice and consulting the pitching card. If the pitching card indicates that the batter made contact (fly ball, line drive, or ground ball), the batting card is then checked against the result of another dice roll to determine where and how far the ball is hit.&#10;&#10;The batted ball is plotted on the gameboard with the built-in batting stick. Defensive players, who were positioned on the playing field grid, attempt to make a play on the batted ball. Depending upon their initial positioning, their speed, their fielding ability, and in some cases their arm strength, the result may be a base hit, an out, or an error.&#10;&#10;The appeal of 851 Baseball is that it depicts the movement of the ball, defensive players, and baserunners as each play unfolds. For example, a line drive might be caught by an outfielder or it might find the gap and roll to the wall. Baserunners advance according to their speed and can be instructed to try to take an extra base.&#10;&#10;Multiple dice rolls can be required to fully resolve the outcome of an at bat, but play moves relatively quickly and the visual element sets this game apart from most other baseball boardgames.&#10;&#10;The game comes with gameboard and batting stick, 5 dice (4 six-sided and 1 twenty-sided), color-coded playing pieces, rule book, 10 batting cards, 10 pitching cards, a pad of scoresheets, all attractively packaged in a game box.&#10;&#10;"

These battles are often characterized as the modern system of skirmishers and columns against outdated linear tactics. However recent research has challenged this simplistic view in that Prussia had begun to modernize their infantry tactics and used skirmishers following their conflict with the Revolutionary French Armies.&#10;&#10;La Bataille d&rsquo; Halle is such a battle. The French Corps of Bernadotte attacks the Reserve Corps of the Duke of Wurttemberg. The Prussians are defending the Army&rsquo;s line of communication which runs through an important crossing of the River Saale. The roads to both Leipzig and Magdeburg exit from this city and the main Prussian Army is retreating along one of them.  Marshal Bernadotte moves onto the map and attempts to break through in pursuit of that main army. Victory levels are determined based on your ability to better the historical result.&#10;&#10;Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.&#10;&#10;The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent.
