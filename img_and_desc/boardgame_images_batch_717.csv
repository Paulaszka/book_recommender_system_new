You will recruit crew members (some better than others), sabotage other players (all in the name of peace, of course), and fight for control of ship sections (sorry, no holodeck). Action is cut-throat, a well-played card can change the direction of the game, and in the end, only one leader will arise as the new captain of the FSS Polemus.&#10;&#10;Storm the Bridge is completely card-based, with 14 oversized cards (nine leaders and five ship sections) and 140 poker-size cards (35 crew members and 105 action cards). Players use their leaders to recruit crew members, and then use the leaders and crew members to recruit better crew and attack ship sections, while using action cards to add bonuses, sabotage the other player, modify crew members, and more. The goal is to control the Bridge ship section card and two other ship sections, then use the Bridge's unique ability - Victory!&#10;&#10;"

Each cult is in competition to be first to summon their god, but they all must also repel intrepid investigators working to seal off the gate to beyond with Elder signs. Gather arcane artifacts, cast powerful spells, embrace the Dark Gift of your Elder God, and be first to hasten doom...before it's too late!&#10;&#10;During the game, players use a variable hand of spell cards to do one of two things to aid their cult in their mission: Use the spell's Astral Symbol to navigate the areas around Arkham on the unique Fate Clock board, or use the symbols in a location's Astral Column to ready a spell. Readied spells can be cast at any time, but while in a cult's Spell Reserve their primary Astral Symbol can aid in readying future spells, creating an engine for pumping out more potential power.&#10;&#10;As cults travel to the six locations on the Fate Clock, they activate specific powerful abilities, such as gaining useful artifacts at The Museum or enabling their Elder God's Dark Gift at The Ceremony. As cults send more and more cultists to a location, they may gain control there, adding even more powerful abilities. However, cults must be careful how they navigate Arkham as a location with lots of activity will attract pesky investigators. Tempt fate too many times and the investigators may raid your cult's lodge, placing Elder Signs, and generally getting in the way of summoning your Elder God. Gain too many Elder Signs and it's game over!&#10;&#10;If any cult can manage to raise their Summon Track to 9 before the investigators save humanity, their Elder God awakens and they win! Of course, &quot;win&quot; is a relative term as it will certainly herald the end of the world &mdash; but that's a small price to pay for eternal servitude to the Ancient Ones.&#10;&#10;"

Watch out, as you and your fellow monkey climbers must escape his hazardous spells. Bananas, faeries and anvils, oh my! You never know what Kurgill will throw at you next. Only the Treetop is safe. Climb as quickly as you can, battle to knock each other down, dodge the traps, and above all, beware of the Gnome. It&rsquo;s a race to the top.&#10;&#10;Monkey is a fast-paced, goofy card game where the odds are against you. It can be played with up to 4 players and even includes a solitaire mode. Each player is a monkey who starts at the bottom of the collective &ldquo;Tree.&rdquo; Four cards make up the &ldquo;Trunk&rdquo; of the Tree and three cards make up the &ldquo;Treetop.&rdquo; Each turn starts with you drawing a card into your hand from the draw pile, then flipping over the top card of the &ldquo;Spell Deck&rdquo; (usually this &ldquo;spell&rdquo; harms you, but you might get lucky!). Finally, you get two Action Points (APs) to spend during your turn. You can spend APs to draw cards, to attempt to climb up the Tree (ie. to the next position up), or to set traps to impede the progress of other players. Each Tree card (whether a Trunk or Treetop card) has a number (1-10, 15 or 20), which is colored (yellow, blue, green, red, black or multicolored). Each time a player attempts to climb a Tree card they combine cards from their hand until their sum exceeds the number on the Tree card. But there&rsquo;s a twist: color matters! If the Tree card is red, yellow, green or blue, then the player may use anything except that color in their attempt to climb. (For example, if the Tree card is a yellow 10, a player could combine a blue 6 and a green 5 to beat it. However, a player could not have used a yellow 15 to beat it since the Tree card itself was yellow and such &quot;color matching&quot; is not allowed). There are two exceptions: Black can only be beaten by black, and multicolored cards can be beaten by any cards.&#10;&#10;Just when you think you have it, Kurgill the Wizard might prevent you from climbing, or even worse, might send you falling back down the Tree. The standard gameplay will keep you entertained, but in case you want to mix it up, Monkey also has three variations: &ldquo;Insane Mode,&rdquo; in which you remove the main good cards from the Spell Deck; &ldquo;Super-Tree,&rdquo; in which each player has their own Trunk to climb but a shared Treetop from which they can oust other players; and finally &ldquo;Krazy Kurgz,&rdquo; in which Kurgill the Wizard joins as an opponent to all players, to wreak havoc along with his birdie minions. Monkey is a great family game, quick to pick up, and always entertaining!&#10;&#10;"

One deck is of five letter words, the other of seven letter words. The active player looks at the word at the top of a card that is drawn from the deck of his choice. The rest of the card is hidden. He then either (i) begins naming the word's anagrams that may be hidden on the card, or (ii) says &quot;Strudel&quot; if he believes the word has no anagrams. He tips his timer to its side when he is finished naming anagrams or when he says Strudel and then re-starts it on his next turn. Players advance on a score track for each anagram they name and for each correct Strudel. They are penalized for incorrect Strudels.

In Transnistrian Insurrection up to four players can take on the roles of the commanders of either; Transnistria/Russia, Moldova/Romania, Belarus, or the Ukraine. They will be fighting for control of the old Soviet sphere of influence as the Moldova/Romania your main goal will be to take out the break away nation of Transnistria before the Russian Army can break through the Ukraine to help them. The game works in phases where each player will switch off and have good opportunities to counter attack and stand there ground when need be. The game also uses an interest damage chit pulling system to simulate the unexpected nature of modern combat. This is a deep war-game that can make you think about the real possibilities of a war like this in the very near future.&#10;&#10;"

Only the top card of each row is available for play action. Players are then dealt a hand of action cards that allow them to move cards in the tableau, search the dig field, dig in one column of the field, or transfer cards to the collection site (in a separate area). &quot;No Trespassing&quot; cards will block digging in a particular column and force a player to play a (limited quantity) &quot;Permit&quot; card in order to access any artifacts locked above that card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the 15th artifact or dirt sample card has been moved to the Collection Site or when players are blocked from moving any more cards.

During this time, you and your friends find yourselves amongst mysterious events. You are surrounded by strange figures, letters with unreadable texts, as well as sudden appearances of being unknown. By relying on your connections, you set out to investigate these incidents. Unknown to you are the frightful truths that lie in wait ahead of you...&#10;&#10;Lovecraft Letter is a card game that combines the Love Letter system with the world of H.P. Lovecraft. In addition to the standard sixteen cards in the Love Letter game are new versions of the cards that include special &quot;insanity&quot; powers. If you have one of these cards in your discard pile, then you are insane (at least for the current round) and on future turns can play insanity cards for their regular power or their special power, giving you more options during play. The risk, however, is that you must undergo a sanity check at the start of each of your turns, drawing as many cards from the deck as the number of insanity cards in front of you; draw one or more insanity cards, and you're out for the round.&#10;&#10;If you win the game, whether by being the last person standing or the player with the highest single card after the deck runs out, you win a token colored to reflect whether you were sane or insane. Win enough tokens of the right type, and you win the game.

The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.&#10;&#10;All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.&#10;&#10;Core Set: Includes 50 sentence cards and 146 noun cards.

With beautifully crafted miniatures, this game brings to life the thrilling tale of heroes who shape the course of war.&#10;&#10;&#10;In this game, players take on the role of one of these iconic factions, vying to expand their kingdom and conquer new territories. Every great kingdom starts small, and players begin their journey with just a humble town hall, a handful of peons, and a lone warrior. From this modest beginning, players must venture out, explore the surrounding lands, strengthen their workforce, build a formidable army, and develop their kingdom. This requires careful decision-making, resource management, and strategic warfare.&#10;&#10;&#10;As players progress and achieve milestones in their kingdom's development, they unlock a multitude of advantages. Peons evolve into mighty warriors, warriors ascend to become powerful heroes, and town halls transform into majestic castles. Players also gain access to water vessels and air vessels, as well as mythical creatures. By boarding these vessels and creatures with their units, players can traverse the expansive game board more swiftly and position their armies for devastating attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;Warfare in Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea employs a meticulously designed cost/reward system, outlined on tactics cards that players must secretly select. The availability of these tactics cards depends on the units involved in the conflict. It is during these intense battles that players must showcase their strategic prowess and fight for victory, knowing that history is written by the victors.&#10;&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Heroes of Land, Air &amp; Sea features two distinct economic systems. The first involves the risky acquisition and careful management of vital resources such as food, ore, and mana. The second system introduces a unique twist on worker placement, where players must strategically allocate their peons to construct buildings. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that these peons could also be utilized for exploration, expansion, exploitation, or even extermination! Achieving the perfect equilibrium between these two systems is absolutely pivotal for securing victory in this thrilling game.&#10;&#10;"

This deadly game of chance will not only test your luck, but your nerves as well.&#10;&#10;Each round, the dealer deals face-up a card to each player from the deck. If the card is a Click, the player will stay alive and continue in the round, but if it is a Bang!, the player has gotten shot and must leave the round with no points. Each Click card will also contain the number of points won by the player who posses it. The play continues in a clockwise fashion with each player deciding whether they will like to collect their points and exit the round, or risk their lives with a new card for the possibility of getting more points. Once all the players have either chosen to leave or have been shot, the points are tallied, the deck is shuffled, and the next round begins. The first player to 50 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Welcome to the grimdark. Welcome to DAYNIGHTZ&trade;&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Dawn breaks on the refuge, and the sunrays bring you the feared news&hellip;the day has come, the day to go back to the city. When this damned thing started, you joined a group of survivors that had gathered in the woods, fleeing from the city. With tremendous effort, you erected a makeshift refuge to fend off the foul creatures, waiting for the army to come and save you. However, help is not coming, you know that now. And so do the traitors who quietly left the refuge last night, taking most of the remaining supplies with them. Now you are forced to go back to the city: It&rsquo;s the only option if you want to survive another day&hellip;&#10;&#10;This is the starting point of DAYNIGHTZ&trade;. You get to pick a group of up to 4 survivors, each with its own character sheet that shows its attributes and abilities, a backpack and some equipment. Now you&rsquo;re ready to start your adventure in a nightmare world, where the dead rule above the living.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;What is your goal?That depends on the game mode chosen:&#10;&#10;-&gt; In campaign mode you will have to brave narrative missions where you will have to fight and take difficult decisions, that will determine your progress, culminating in one of three possible endings.&#10;-&gt; In survival mode you will roam from city to city, with complete freedom to do whatever it takes to survive another day on this hell on earth.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;How are you going to achieve your goal?The game is divided in 3 segments: Adventure Phase, Travel Phase and Refuge Phase.&#10;&#10;1) Adventure Phase: This is the most important phase of the game. In it, players will roam the streets and alleys of the city, exploring locales, suffering encounters and generally trying to keep a low profile while striving to achieve their goals (established by the campaign mission in the campaign mode or by their own interests in the survival mode).&#10;&#10;One of the many things that set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other games is that is played on TWO LEVELS. What does that mean?&#10;&#10;On one hand there is the City board, consisting of a labyrinth of streets, alleys, surprise zones and locations. On the other hand, whenever the players want to explore a certain location, or due to the triggering of events and conditions, players will lay out tiles to represent that particular location. Each location has its own set of tiles, depending on its nature. For example, the Firemen Park location consists of the parking tile, the locker room tile and the offices tile.&#10;&#10;2) Travel Phase: Once the Adventure Phase is finished, survivors will have to trudge back to their refuge with their meager loot. In this phase survivors will have to face different situations, like zombie encounters, coming across abandoned structures (farms, etc) and being assaulted by other survivor groups.&#10;&#10;3) Refuge Phase: This is a management phase, where survivors will have to handle, upgrade and defend their base. While in the refuge survivors can do a lot of stuff: recover from their wounds/infections, level up, stock supplies, farm food, upgrade the refuge&rsquo;s defenses&hellip;The refuge, though, will be attacked regularly by either roamer&rsquo;s packs or other survivor groups, who can also steal and sabotage your base. That is more likely to happen if you&rsquo;re away for extended periods, so try to do your city supply runs as fast as possible&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;What is the core mechanic?DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is based on a double profile system, for both the zombies and the survivors: during the day, zombies use their worse profile, while during the night, zombie use their better profile and survivors will use their worse profile, unless they&rsquo;re equipped with a light source&hellip;which are obviously very scarce and run out very fast! The day and night cycle is controlled through a timetable located on the City board.&#10;&#10;On top of that, other elements can make the brave survivor&rsquo;s life even more difficult:&#10;&#10;- Threat Counter: Consists of a counter that increases as a result of diverse things happening, like survivors making noise, environmental effects, zombies amassing, etc. The higher the Threat counter, the higher the risk the survivors are taking by staying in the city.&#10;&#10;- Threat Encounters: Each end of turn you will verify the conditions stated in a card. If you meet the conditions, you will suffer a Threat encounter. That might not happen very frequently but&hellip;beware when it does happen!&#10;&#10;- The Hunter: The Hunter is the most dangerous zombie in the game. Luckily, it only appears at night; unfortunately, when it appears it will attack all the survivors who are out in the open (in streets and alleys). So keep this in mind: you don&rsquo;t want to be wandering around in the open at night!&#10;&#10;- Survivor&rsquo;s health and stress: DAYNIGHTZ&trade; is a very realistic game. Thus, the more wounded your survivor is, the more difficult it will be for him/her to accomplish actions (in combat or out of it). Also, your survivor will be able to do less actions the more wounded he/she is. Stress is also key, as your survivor will be affected by events depending on their stress level, which can also impact on their attribute checks.&#10;&#10;- Infection: Survivors can get infected when wounded by a zombies, while searching corpses or by other special effects. Once infected, the disease will deteriorate the survivor and if not treated, will end up killing him/her. Of course, the infection will be more easily neutered in its early stages; the more you wait, the harder it will be to remove it. While infected, your survivor will periodically succumb to its effects, which can make them bleed, make them slower, etc.&#10;&#10;To help them deal with the situations that they will find themselves in, the survivors can use a lot of items that they will find in their city wanderings. However, all said items will either need consumables in order to function or will wear away with use&hellip;&#10;&#10;The players will also encounter other survivors and animals during their travels, which, depending on the decisions previously taken and the success in the encounters, can join their group as allies. Allies can give a series of bonuses to the survivors, but will not remain with them forever: allies have their own loyalty system, which depends on the actions taken by the players. The way you treat them will determine how they treat you!&#10;&#10;All the points above, plus others that you will discover during gameplay, set DAYNIGHTZ&trade; apart from other zombie-themed games. We have worked really hard to achieve an immersive experience, exploring the dark themes of the zombie apocalypse, and we welcome you.&#10;&#10;PS: If you want to keep with all the info about the game, you can follow us in:&#10;&#10;"

Ci riuscirete? Beh, in bocca al Rinoceronte!&#10;&#10;OrgoglioNerd: Area Stampa &egrave; un gioco di carte in cui vestirete i panni di uno dei redattori del portale. Ciascuno di voi sar&agrave; caratterizzato da un potere unico legato alla vostra particolare personalit&agrave; da nerd che durante il gioco potrete sfruttare per interagire con i vostri avversari. Per vincere dovrete riuscire a conquistare 3 punti Ego, ottenuti chiudendo gli articoli che il mazzo di carte al centro del tavolo vi proporr&agrave; di volta in volta, oppure fregando il pezzo ai vostri avversari. Entrambi i metodi sono pi&ugrave; che leciti, star&agrave; a voi risolverli con le Buone, con le Cattive o a Modo vostro. Una volta raggiunto il terzo Ego otterrete il titolo di Rinoceronte, ma per vincere la partita dovrete dimostrare di esserne degni sfidando i vostri avversari e abbattendoli uno ad uno a colpi di mood. Il nuovo Rinoceronte sar&agrave; colui che riuscir&agrave; a dimostrarsi degno del titolo di predatore ultimo e di leader indiscusso della redazione!&#10;&#10;Prodotto realizzato in collaborazione con la redazione di OrgoglioNerd.&#10;&#10;Elementi del gioco:&#10;55 carte&#10;6 segnalini Ego&#10;1 regolamento&#10;&#10;"
