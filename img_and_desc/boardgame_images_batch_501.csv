Gameplay takes place on a 6x6 board.  To set up, you each spread your 18 pieces at random on your half of the board. The black player begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, choose a piece or a stack of more than one piece that you control--you control a piece/stack if your color is on top--then move that piece/stack so that it lands on something of the same type, i.e., a single piece needs to land on a single piece and a stack on a stack. You move the piece/stack orthogonally 1-3 steps to occupied fields, with the number of steps matching the number of marks on the topmost piece. You can move the piece/stack at a 90&ordm; angle with each step (at an occupied field), so a piece/stack that moves 2 steps can go straight to the second occupied field or it can make a single 90&ordm; turn as it passes over the first occupied field.&#10;&#10;As more spaces become empty, fewer movement options remain open to players, and as soon as any one player cannot move, the game ends. Each player then scores for the pieces and stacks they control. The value of a piece/stack is the number of marks on the topmost piece multiplied by the number of pieces in that stack, which means a piece on its own is worth only 1-3 points. Whoever has the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;"

One would be fairly easy and the other extremely hard. Pelelieu became a vortex that took way more Marines lives than it was worth. The Japanese had dug themselves into the Umurbrogal Mountain and forced the battle to be drawn out for 2 months, instead of 2 weeks.&#10;&#10;[From the publishers website]&#10;This is the fourth in the PIC series of games that simulate island battles in the Pacific Ocean Area during WWII. The game is a blend of operational/tactical level combat and maneuver during the taking of the islands of Pelelieu and Angaur from the Japanese during the Second World War. The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. They fight so hard in fact that the Marines are stymied for much longer than planned and need to be releived by US Army troops from the 81st Division after they took Angaur.  The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.&#10;&#10;The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.&#10;&#10;The are a number of scenarios that simulate the battle on a smaller scale and allow for play for either island or both.  There will be numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.  These include additional Japanese forces that could have been there if they were not sunk by US submarines.&#10;&#10;Game Design and Production by:    Chris Fasulo&#10;&#10;Map Artwork:    Kyle Gebhardt&#10;&#10;"

Whose villages will stand, and whose will fall?&#10;&#10;Each card has a gold value, and your goal is to earn 100 gold pieces across multiple rounds by building villages. Do this by collecting three unit cards of the same color and laying them down. If an enemy puts down a card you'd like to have, it's time for battle! Send out your village's finest hero or hire one in secret by playing it face-down from your hand, and your opponent will do the same. Play the stronger card, and you'll be able to take a prisoner from your enemy's village and make it part of your own.&#10;&#10;However, it's not enough to simply send your most powerful units to attack neighboring kingdoms. Each unit has its own winning strategies: knights excel at defense, the wizard's power falters only when facing enemies of the same color, the dragon's strength increases with each enemy he defeats, and heroes become much stronger when you're in last place. These are only a few of the 15 different unit types you'll command. With the right combination of luck and skill, you'll always come out on top.&#10;&#10;War is one way to expand your empire, but it is certainly not the only way.
