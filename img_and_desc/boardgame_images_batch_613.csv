If two failures are rolled the player's turn ends and passes to the other player.&#10;&#10;From the publishers website:&#10;&#10;A Fistful of Kung Fu brings the hyper-kinetic, bullet-spraying, demon-slaying, kung-fu-fighting action of Hong Kong movies and Asian cinema to the wargames tabletop. In a modern world walking a precarious line between the advances of next-generation technology and the tradition and mysticism of ancient cultures, Kung Fu schools face off in no-holds-barred tournaments, corporations hire agents and spies to steal each other's secrets, overworked SWAT teams respond to gunfights between feuding Triad and Yakuza clans, and ancient artefacts are sought by hopping vampires, demon sorcerers and cyborgs alike. Combining the gunfights of John Woo&rsquo;s Hard Boiled, the hand-to-hand combat of Enter the Dragon, the sheer mystical weirdness of Big Trouble in Little China, the wuxia action of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and everything in-between, A Fistful of Kung Fu is a skirmish wargame unlike any other&#10;&#10;"

With the restoration of Coldrum Manor ongoing, there has never been a better time to document its history, and it seems apt that it should be a Coldrum to relate the tale.&#10;&#10;Coldrum Manor, more commonly known as the derisory &ldquo;Redcap Manor&rdquo;, was built atop Mossdown Hill, a site long associated with spirits and faeries. Legend speaks of a series of standing stones that once stood near the hill, and Roman records of the area describe pagan rites involving human sacrifice. The strategic location of Mossdown Hill has long been recognised, and several strongholds have been constructed at this site over the last one thousand years.&#10;&#10;'Redcap Manor' draws from the most traditional tales of haunting in the British Isles, in which it was faeries, not ghosts, that kept people awake at night. In 'Redcap Manor', each player represents one of four Edwardian investigators sent to the titular mansion, to gather as much evidence for the uncanny as they can over three nights. To this end, the protagonists will use the recently-harnessed power of electromagnetism against the Fae.&#10;&#10;'Redcap Manor' is an auction/bluffing card game, divided into three turns representing the three nights of terror. Each turn, the players select a number of Haunt cards from their hand, to be secretly shuffled into the Haunt deck for the next night. Haunt cards are divided into three types: Fae, Presence, and Influence cards, each of which is countered by a different Ward card. Each player then places one of their three Ward cards face-down, and takes it in turns to uncover the top-most Haunt card. Eight cards are revealed per turn, representing eight hours before the dawn. After revealing a Haunt card, a player may choose to flee the Manor, but may not re-enter that night. The Haunt card remains face-up, and may be taken by subsequent players, together with any newly revealed cards. Alternatively, the player may take the Haunt card(s) - any Haunt cards countered by their Ward are taken as evidence (victory points); however, if the top-most card is not countered by their Ward, it is taken as a curse. Each Haunt card (24 unique cards, one for each hour of each night) has its own effect, influencing how the game is played. The player must determine whether taking a curse is worth the opportunity to acquire more evidence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the third night, the player with the most evidence points is the victor.&#10;&#10;"

Combat, though abstracted, takes into account leadership, the class and condition of your ships, and of course the Weather Gauge. In an Age of Sail, wind and water conditions are critical, even at the &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level. Movement uses a point-to-point system where costs change with the wind and you will often be unable to go where you desire. Actions are &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;, but unlike many naval games, plotting is not required. Special features of Yellow Jack include the Hurricane Season, amphibious assaults and land campaigns, and the Yellow Jack itself &ndash; Yellow Fever.&#10;&#10;Time Required: 3 hours for a Minor Scenario; 1 weekend for the Campaign Game. As a bonus, there are also scenarios for 1744-1748, when the Caribbean struggle became submerged in the greater War of the Austrian Succession; these allow an Extended Campaign covering 1739-1748.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;6 die cut counter sheets &ndash; 720 counters &ndash; including the naval forces of Britain, Spain, and France, plus Pirates (no Caribbean naval game is complete without Pirates). One of the counter sheets includes all the important naval leaders who participated in the War of the Austrian Succession; another consists of land units &ndash; all the regiments that fought in the Caribbean. There is also a sheet of generic markers.&#10;&#10;37 wooden disks representing &ldquo;task forces&rdquo; (boxed game only; regular counters are also supplied to represent these items).&#10;48&rdquo; x 54&rdquo; map depicting the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Carolinas coastline.&#10;&#10;1 series rulebook, 1 exclusive rule book, 2 scenario/OOB books, 1 set of charts &amp; tables, historical commentary. 1 set of display cards.&#10;&#10;"

Three periods constitute a complete game. The deal switches after each period.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing one card from their hand face up in a common playing area. All cards are played on top of one another so that only the most recently played card is visible.&#10;&#10;If a played card matches the rank (number) of the top card of the pile (e.g. a &quot;6&quot; is played on top of another &quot;6&quot;) it creates a &quot;breakaway&quot; for that player. Jacks always create breakaways when played, regardless of the previous card in the stack.&#10;&#10;Once a breakaway has been created, that player now needs to try to match the rank of the next card played by the opponent. If able to do so, a goal is scored.&#10;&#10;The player with the most goals at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Each card depicts an event in the history of the Belgian television, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.&#10;&#10;The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.&#10;&#10;Timeline: 60 ans de t&eacute;l&eacute;vision &agrave; la RTBF can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.&#10;&#10;"

The game is played over 3 rounds (periods). The players should ideally play facing each other and have access to a 6-card inverted pyramid game area.&#10;&#10;Each game area consists of 3 rows. The row closest to the player represents the goalkeeper. A single card is placed in this row. The second row holds two cards, representing defenders. The third, and final row, holds three cards, representing the forwards on the team. All cards are placed face up in a portrait orientation except the goalkeeper which is placed face down in a landscape orientation.&#10;&#10;The first player, determined in whatever fashion the players desire, shuffles the deck and secretly looks at the top card. He can choose to place this card in any open position in his own play area. Once placed, the card cannot be moved. Once all six spots are filled, the deck is passed to the opponent who fills his own six spots in like manner.&#10;&#10;Players take turns advancing on their opponent. Each turn begins with the player flipping over the top card of the deck and comparing it to his opponent's line of forwards. If the card matches or beats another card in value, both cards are discarded and the player is considered having advanced past that hockey player. If multiple cards meet the criteria, the player chooses which route to take.&#10;&#10;There is a strategic element when deciding which route to take when advancing on your opponent. With your first card, you compare against the three forwards. Once you have overcome a forward, your options for advancement may be limited. At no point are you allowed to skip another card in order to reach a more favorable card.&#10;&#10;Let's say that you use your first card to overtake the center forward with your first card &mdash; you now have clear line of sight to both remaining forwards and the two defenders, but the goal is still blocked. If, on the other hand, you advanced past the left side forward, only the center forward and left defender are &quot;open&quot; to you.&#10;&#10;Once the goal is &quot;open&quot;, you are free to attempt to score at any point. You simply announce that you will shoot instead of taking on a hockey player. Your card is compared to the value of the goalkeeper. If your card is [i]higher[/i] in value, you have scored a goal. Regardless, both cards are discarded as usual.&#10;&#10;Whether a goal is successfully scored or not, it is now your opponents turn. Play also switches if you fail to successfully overtake enough players to clear an open path to your opponent's goal.&#10;&#10;Your opponent will begin his turn by first filling any open spots as was done when the game began. He then takes his turn as normal.&#10;&#10;Special Rule: When only one card is left in the deck, a player may, on his turn, assuming his team slots are filled, attempt a shot on goal regardless of whether an open path exists or not.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is exhausted, the period is considered having ended. All cards are gathered up, play switches to the next player who shuffles and drafts his team as was done at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Once three periods have been played, the player with the most goals is declared the winner. There are no rules for breaking ties.&#10;&#10;"

You will be amazed about what you will find out about your friends.&#10;&#10;It's a simple and fun adult card game that is different every time you play, as different groups will respond in different ways. You will find out more about your friends or new people at a party. You will be amazed and surprised about the answers you get to intimate, probing questions. We are sure you will be surprised about what you learn about your friends.&#10;&#10;In its simplistic form, a dealer reads a question from the deck and you anonymously answer 'Yes' or 'No'. The dealer tries to guess how many answered 'Yes' or 'No', and if they guess correctly, they keep the question card. If not the dealer decides which stories they want to hear why people answered 'Yes' or 'No'. If the dealer wants to hear the 'Yes' stories and you as a player answered yes, you can choose to tell the story to win the card, or keep quiet and remain anonymous. If there are more than one 'Yes' cards, then multiple people can tell their stories and the dealer decides which story wins. At the end of the game, the player who has gathered the most cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;The great thing about this game is that you have the freedom to choose to remain anonymous or to share the stories behind your answer - so you decide on what to divulge to the group you&rsquo;re playing with, it allows you to freely express something in public without the repercussions.&#10;&#10;The game provides the environment to share stories and situations and engage in conversations that you would not normally engage in. You will be amazed what you find out about your friends. Is an adult game(18+), so as you can imagine there are some pretty risque questions.&#10;&#10;Here are a couple of 'tame' sample questions in the deck:&#10;&#10;Have you ever had a DUI?&#10;Have you ever been arrested?&#10;Have you ever lied on a tax return?&#10;&#10;"
