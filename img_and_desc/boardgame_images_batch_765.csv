Some groups meet their untimely demise at the hands of monsters all too soon, and Unbroken is a story of one such ill-advised expedition.&#10;&#10;You, the player, take on the role of the sole survivor of that failed adventure. Finding yourself in hostile territory, weak and wounded, you will need to gather your wits and strength, craft weapons from scraps found around you, and attempt to tackle progressively more challenging monsters on your way out of this forsaken place.&#10;&#10;Unbroken is a solo card game that is quick to set up and play but one that will produce a tense challenging experience.&#10;&#10;You will collect resources representing your character's abilities and will need to ensure that you invest in a right mix of resources to both keep yourself alive during your travels and also prepare for the gruesome monsters that wait in the dark. There are several options at your disposal - brute force, trickery, clever use of skills.&#10;&#10;Customize your character and use your limited resources wisely - only the craftiest and the most resilient survivors will make it out alive.&#10;&#10;"

It is based in the Project Touhou universe, with character cards representing various characters from the Project Touhou universe, drawn by many different artists (see below). &#10;&#10;The game box contains 8 dice, 54 characters cards (6 x 9 characters) and 6 rules summary cards.&#10;&#10;The players all start with the Daiyousei character card. They take turns at rolling dice.&#10;&#10;More specifically, a player's turn consists of:&#10;1. You throw initially 3 dice&#10;2. You may use as many character cards you have in your possession to tweak that initial roll. The effects could be to change the dice value or add more dice for instance.&#10;3. After modification, if you achieve a specific condition you can get a new character card which you will be able to use at your next run. Now your turn ends.&#10;&#10;The game continues until a player manages to get the Flandre character card.&#10;&#10;Note: The rulebook is in Japanese but no Japanese is needed for playing the game as the cards only have symbols (dice sides and numbers).&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#10;Twist your&#227;&#128;&#128;'Fate' !&#10;&#10;You think it's over?

QUARTINO is just for you! This dynamic and clever game from Czech author Petr Doubek shall satisfy your gaming needs&hellip;&#10;&#10;QUARTINO is an original abstract strategy game with simple rules. It is full of unexpected turns and the suspense lasts until the very last turn. Be the first to clear your hand by creating the right pattern on the board and you&rsquo;re the winner. Easy, right? However, be aware your opponents all have the same goal.&#10;&#10;QUARTINO rewards forward thinking, spatial awareness, and sustained focus. However, there is just enough oportunities to allow for unexpected twists and keep players on their toes!&#10; Design of the game is very elegant and the game uses only natural materials. The game revolves around a laser-cut wooden board, complemented with wooden stands and wooden stones of four different colors. The game also contains 24 QUARTINO cards, each with a unique combination of four colors.&#10;&#10;Awards &amp; Honors&#10;2021 IG Players Choice Award&#10;2022 &Eacute;ducaFLIP Nomin&eacute;&#10;&#10;How to play QUARTINO? &#10;Each player draws four QUARTINO cards and places them secretly in his card stand. Each card contains a unique combination of four colors. Players take turns, and in each turn they place one stone of their choice on the game board. They try to complete one of their QUARTINO cards, i.e. create a color combination matching one of their cards. Game stones can be placed on top of each other. For the completion of QUARTINO, only the top stones count.&#10;If a player completes a QUARTINO on the game board, he shows the card and removes all stones from the QUARTINO from the game board. Then she plays again, i.e. places a new stone.&#10;Whoever completes all his QUARTINO cards first, wins the game.&#10;Before each player&acute;s turn, two special rules can come to play:&#10;If there are 4 or more stones of the same color on the board (all stones, not just top stones), the player can say &ldquo;color&rdquo; and place an additional stone.&#10;if there are 4 or more stones of any color on top of each other on the board, the player needs to remove all the stones in such columns. The player can then place an additional stone.&#10;&#10;QUARTINO - theory of game &#10;Rules for QUARTINO game you can find in the box, but here you can find some tips how to play successfully.&#10;&#10;Of course, you can play randomly without much thought and analysis, which we recommend especially when you play with children or when play 3 or more players. However, there are 5 basic tips for a more successful and interesting game for two players game.&#10;&#10;1) First look closely at all 24 cards in the game. You will find that some of them can have up to 3 positions in the same color combinations. Imagine a order of place stones so that your opponent does not have a chance to make a combination from another card after your turn.&#10;2) Imagine before your turn whether your opponent could make a combination after place your stone. You don't have to count the combination you have and the ones your opponent has already created and placed on table.&#10;3) Before first turn: Look closely on cards you have and try to find pair with some common color combination. This can help you to win one of them easily.&#10;4) If you place first stone, try to make rule &quot;Column&quot;(4 stones in one column) as fast as possible, but only in situation, when opponent don't have chance to make combination. It will help you to avoid situation when is on board 12 stones (3 pieces from each color) and you have to place 4. stone from some color. &#10;5) Try to remember stone colors and their positions your opponent try to place. You can learn from this his card combinations.&#10;&#10;Lot of those tips use players at QUARTINO tournaments. Game is a bit longer then, but you can use e.g. chess clock to limit time for one game.&#10;&#10;"

The design is effectively a deconstruction of the concept of a wargame, removing all ornament and unnecessary layers of complexity in order to retain only its essence. Despite its parsimonious nature, in War: The Board Game players face situations that can be considered direct representations of the reality in warfare. They need to protect the supply lines and headquarters, capture prisoners, flank and surround enemies, take advantage of geographical features etc.&#10;&#10;The strategic depth of the game and the absence of in-game randomness, aims at rewarding experienced players. However, the learning curve is not steep and the millions of possible situations in the game make almost impossible to master it completely. Each games plays very differently depending on the type of strategy players attempt. Games can be very short if both opponents play very offensively or longer if they adopt a more conservative defensive strategy. As in reality, War: the Board Game can be won sometimes by a blitz attack or by attrition warfare.&#10;&#10;Although War: the Board Game is a game with open information, the randomized initial setup and the addition of special rules for each scenario (e.g. antiquity wars, WWI, WWII, etc.) make the game replayable ad infinitum and avoid the problem of players memorizing and replicating standard initial moves and tactics. Moreover, the special scenario rules not only add thematic flavor to the game, but also introduce an different spatial element and make much more difficult to predict enemy's actions.&#10;&#10;War: the Board Game is language independent and can be played 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 (Allies) or 4 players (free for all). The Allies (2 vs 2) version of the game adds an extra twist and new strategic and tactical options. Allies version can be also playable by 2 or 3 players (1 vs 2) if players want to control two armies and headquarters.&#10;&#10;"

There are multiple paths to victory.&#10;&#10;The game includes complex decision making and layers of thinking, especially if you play the &ldquo;draft&rdquo; or &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; formats.&#10;&#10;To play the basic format, you must shuffle the 66 card deck and pass out 33 to each player. Revealing the bottom card will show who goes first. On your turn, you cast a spell, and your opponent may or may not try to block it with a trap. Spells are placed based on mana energy available to the players. A player loses the game when they must draw a card, but they cannot. The complete instructions (including constructed format instructions) are found in the deck or on the website.&#10;&#10;"

Broken words are brought to the factory every day. Can you combine these letters and repair those words?&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#230;&#128;&#170;&#231;&#141;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#185; (Dai Kaiju Kotobamodos) in English means &quot;The Great Monster Kotobamodos&quot;, with the name &quot;Kotobamados&quot; coming from &#232;&#168;&#128;&#232;&#145;&#137; (kotoba) &quot;words&quot; and &#230;&#136;&#187;&#227;&#129;&#153; (modosu) &quot;revert/undo&quot;, so the names means something like &quot;return the words to their original state&quot;, which is a monstrous task.&#10;&#10;This is a word game in which the master creates three words of three letters each behind a screen, then scrambles the letters face down and passes them to the other players. All players race to combine these letters to create the three words, and once someone does, they start a one-minute countdown timer. The first player to create three words scores 3 points, while anyone else who does so with the time limit scores 1 point. For each word that matches the master's word, a player scores 1 point.&#10;&#10;In English, the task of creating words would be relatively simple, but in Japanese, this is a much harder prospect. Japanese uses three writing systems, with Hiragana being the most broad. Hiragana has a lot more letters than the English alphabet, and fewer restrictions in combinations, so three characters can be used in a lot of ways.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a further element in Hiragana: &#230;&#191;&#129;&#231;&#130;&#185; (dakuten), which is a voiced sound mark similar to accents or umlauts. For example, &#227;&#129;&#159; (ta) combined with a Dakuten would be &#227;&#129;&#160; (da), or &#227;&#129;&#153; (su) and a Dakuten would be &#227;&#129;&#154; (zu). In this game, the letter tile for &#227;&#129;&#159; may be used for either &#227;&#129;&#159; or &#227;&#129;&#160;. From around fifty Hiragana letters, twenty of them can be combined with Dakuten. If the tiles offered to solve have several of these twenty Hiragana characters, it becomes very hard to deduce what the secret words actually are. Whilst the game could be played using English lettering, it would lose a lot of the complexity.&#10;&#10;In 2017, a new English/Japanese edition of this game was produced with the new name &#227;&#129;&#189;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#188; (Ponkotsu Factory). &quot;Ponkotsu&quot; means something like silly or clumsy. This edition was co-produced with itten, with new artwork by Yoshiaki Tomioka. In this edition of the game, changes were made to allow for the differences between English and Japanese writing. When playing in English, the master constructs three four-letter words using twelve letter tiles, then mixes them thoroughly. The change to longer words should approximate the challenge of playing in Japanese with only three

However it won't be easy, players on their turn will stop at nothing to Block each other with insults, Pluck tail feathers, and cause all kinds of shenanigans.&#10;&#10;Peacock Block has 2 game modes: Normal play, and an extended game which utilizes the Love Meter. The extended game is fantastic for tournaments, and adds even more strategy to the game.&#10;&#10;For those who like it even more dirty, there is the 2 part expansion called &quot;The Dirty Bird&quot; Expansion, which adds a 6th player to the fun, and the other part adds interchangeable cards that are Not Safe For Work...or ANYWHERE!&#10;&#10;There is also a 2 Player Mode.&#10;&#10;PEACOCK BLOCK IS SOLD IN 155 STORES ACROSS 46 STATES IN THE USA!&#10;&#10;GET THE GAME AT THE FOLLOWING STORES:&#10;(In Alphabetical Order By State Then City)&#10;&#10;ALABAMA&#10;Huntsville AL - Lucky Dice Cafe&#10;Pinson AL - Mythic Cards &amp; Games&#10;&#10;ARIZONA&#10;Phoenix AZ - Funkatronic Rex&#10;Phoenix AZ - North Valley Games&#10;Tuscon AZ - Tuscon Games And Gadgets (2 locations in this city)&#10;&#10;ARKANSAS&#10;Fayetteville AR - Geek Realms (2 locations for this city)&#10;&#10;CALIFORNIA&#10;Fresno CA - Crazy Squirrel Game Store&#10;Rohnert Park CA - Fundemonium&#10;&#10;COLORADO&#10;Castle Rock - Inconceivable Games&#10;Fort Collins CO - Games Ahoy&#10;Loveland CO - Games Ahoy (2 locations in this city) &#10;Castle Rock - Monument&#10;&#10;CONNECTICUT &#10;Groton CT - Clever Kobold&#10;New Haven CT - Elm City Games&#10;Willimantic CT - Landrop Comics And Games&#10;Windsor CT - House Of Books And Games&#10;&#10;DELEWARE&#10;Dover DE - Born To Game&#10;Middletown DE - Born To Game&#10;Newark DE - The Knights Of Days&#10;&#10;FLORIDA&#10;Altamonte Springs FL - The Collective&#10;Brandon FL - Nerdy Needs &#10;Fort Pierce FL &ndash; Thunderdome Gaming&#10;Gainesville FL - Stomping Grounds Game Center&#10;&#10;GEORGIA&#10;Evans GA - Cardboard Castles&#10;Macy GA - Deep Dive Games&#10;Savannah GA - Morning Star Games &amp; Comics&#10;Statesboro GA - Galactic Comics &amp; Games&#10;Trenton GA - Druid's Lair&#10;&#10;IDAHO&#10;Boise ID &ndash; Deadly Seven Games&#10;&#10;ILLINIOIS&#10;Peoria Heights IL - Cabbages And Kings&#10;&#10;INDIANA&#10;Lebanon IN - Friendly City Games&#10;&#10;IOWA&#10;Ames IA - Main Street Magic, Miniatures, and More&#10;Cedar Rapids IA - First Turn Games&#10;Fairfield IA - Wanderer's Haul&#10;&#10;KENTUCKY&#10;Glasgow KY - Blue Shark Games &amp; Hobbies&#10;Herbon KY - Three Brothers Games&#10;&#10;LOUISIANA&#10;Baton Rouge LA - The Rogue Games&#10;Metairie LA - Plus 1 Gaming&#10;Lakes Charles LA - Paper Heroes&#10;Shreveport LA - The Gamers XP&#10;&#10;MAINE &#10;Biddeford ME - Mill Comics And Games&#10;South Portland ME - Diversion Puzzles And Games&#10;&#10;MARYLAND&#10;Centreville MD - Central Gaming Corps.&#10;&#10;MASSACHUSETTS &#10;Acton MA - GamingEtc Tournament and Superstore&#10;Hadley MA - Off The Wall&#10;Milford MA - TJ Cafe And Games&#10;Somerville MA - Comicazi&#10;Springfield MA - Games N Friends&#10;&#10;MICHIGAN&#10;Bay City MI - The Stadium &#10;Frankenmuth MI- The Stadium &#10;Monroe MI - Our House Games&#10;&#10;MINNESOTA&#10;Bemidji MN - Accidentally Cool Games&#10;Duluth MN - Rogue Robot Games &amp; Comics&#10;Eagan MN &ndash; Galaxy Games&#10;New Ulm MN - Red Dragon Games&#10;Saint Paul MN - Red 6 Games&#10;Warroad MN &ndash; The Shire's Den&#10;&#10;MISSISSIPPI&#10;Brookhaven MS - Hero's Haven&#10;Gautier MS - maCnarB Gaming&#10;Gulfport MS - Panda's Pair O' Dice&#10;&#10;MISSOURI&#10;Columbia MO &ndash; Magelings&#10;Poplar Bluff MO - Ken's Comic Man&#10;&#10;MONTANA&#10;Billings MT - Dragon Egg Games&#10;Evergreen MT - Bards N Cards&#10;&#10;NEBRASKA&#10;Lincoln NE - Mana Games  &#10;Ralston NE - Ground Zero Hobby&#10;&#10;&#10;NEVADA&#10;Fernley NV - Dice N Duels&#10;Reno NV - Games Galore (2 locations)&#10;&#10;NEW HAMPSHIRE&#10;Plymoth NH - Games Ahoy!&#10;&#10;NEW JERSEY&#10;Berlin NJ - Mr. E's Game World&#10;Boonton NJ - Highlander Games&#10;Franklin NJ - 3D Games &amp; Hobbies&#10;Cedar Grove NJ - Time Warp Comics And Games&#10;Haddon Township NJ - Top Deck Games&#10;Hamilton Township NJ - Greg's Games&#10;Hightstown NJ - IRL Gaming&#10;&#10;NEW MEXICO&#10;Albuquerque NM - Artemis Games And More!&#10;Albuquerque NM - Twin Sun Comics And Games&#10;&#10;NEW YORK&#10;Amherst NY - Dragon Snack Games &#10;Batavia NY - Game Cave &#10;Brooklyn NY - Squarrel Cafe&#10;Canton NY - Gamer Craze&#10;Cheektowaga NY - Heart Of The Game &#10;Cobleskill NY - Games A Plunder&#10;Eden NY - Genesis Gaming &amp; Hobby &#10;Elmira Heights NY - Big Nerd Coffee Company / Bell's  Country Coffee &#10;Fredonia NY - Heart Of The Game (formerly Critical Gaming's building) &#10;Lockport NY - Casual Dragon Games &#10;Lynbrook NY &ndash; A Store Of Fire And Dice&#10;Manlius NY - Unplugged Games&#10;Montgomery NY - Silver Sun Games&#10;Mt.

Your goal is to get rid of all. The base cards are ridding in the drop's decks by colors or cost. Super powers could change the balance of the match. The winner is the first one whose hand is empty.&#10;&#10;

The Monopoly-like mechanics are the same: roll and move, buy properties and businesses and make money. In this version of Easy Money a player keeps playing/moving their token until throwing a &ldquo;seven&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;While the MB board had 48 spaces, the wartime Canadian game has only 28 spaces (six spaces and only two properties per side plus four corner spaces labelled &quot;Town Square&quot; (start); Hospital; Victory Bonds; and Income Tax. In addition, there is an inner Chance Circle of 24 spaces, each tied to one of the side spaces. Players who throw doubles on 2D6 take the result from the corresponding inner circle space without moving, and then roll again.&#10;&#10;The theme of wartime sacrifices is strongly represented: even when collecting $200 for passing the Town Square, $100 must be donated to the Victory Bond space, and a player landing on Victory Bonds takes only half the money there. There also are spaces for Blackout Regulations, Air Raid Defense Plan, Soldiers Welfare Project, War Project and Red Cross Project on the outer square, and spaces for Buy War Savings Stamps and Extra Call for Victory Bonds on the inner circle.&#10;&#10;"

On a turn, you choose a player that has a token in front of them, take that token, then present them with a question by choosing one of the three question prompts (which are all color-coded), then choosing two cards from your hand and adding the properly-colored section of those cards to the question. A sample question: &quot;What would you miss more if it ceases to exist: Facebook or doors?&quot; That player secretly votes on A or B, while everyone else but the questioner secretly votes A or B depending on how they think the person will answer; a voter can optionally add their 3x scoring token to their vote.&#10;&#10;Once everyone votes, you reveal the tiles. Everyone who voted correctly moves ahead one or three spaces on the scoring track, and the questioner moves ahead one space for each person who voted incorrectly. If you pass a certain space on the scoring track, you retrieve your 3x token (if you've used it). Since you can ask a question only of those with a token in front of them, everyone is asked roughly the same number of questions, and whoever has the most points after a certain number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;"

Just before the turn into the 20th century Irwin Biddle purchased the house and turned it into what he called an orphanage care facility. But his severe governorship of the orphanage made the home for lost children anything but a haven. A fire in 1939 nearly destroyed the Thornhill Mansion. All but 13 children escaped the blaze. It wasn't until 1956 that Arthur Holland, a mining tycoon, purchased the Thornhill and footed the bill for a full renovation. However, it became clear within weeks of moving his family into the Thornhill that the Victorian mansion was far from settled. Holland's personal account of his family's stay in the Thornhill tells of unexplained children's voices, the sounds of little feet running through the night, of moaning heard inside the walls, even of parts of the house shifting. After leaving the Thornhill, Holland declared, &quot;The place is a house of the dead. No sane person can live well within its walls.&quot;&#10;&#10;13 ghosts live in the Thornhill, victims of the devastating fire that happened so long ago. As a ghost hunter, you welcome the chance to stay in the ghostly orphanage. Will you be the one to finally put the children to rest? Or will the malevolent child spirits drive you insane?&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;In Children the game, you wander around the Thornhill Mansion trying to trap ghosts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, you deal the 13 Ghosts deck face down off to the side on the table. You then deal the 13 Toys cards face up over the 13 Ghosts cards, creating 13 2-card stacks. Each player gets 5 cards (the hand limit at the beginning of the game) from the Children deck.&#10;&#10;Players collectively build the Thornhill Mansion during their turns by placing room cards face up on the table in a grid pattern. The mansion is built in 4 levels--basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor, and 3rd floor. Each room card indicates on which floor it must be placed.&#10;&#10;You search for toys and helpful devices by moving your pawn from room to room throughout the mansion. Each time you enter a room, you draw a card and add it to your hand. With a 5-card hand limit, players are forced to leave cards in rooms by placing them facedown beneath room cards. Players may also leave traps beneath room cards. You look at left-behind cards when you enter rooms. Left-behind traps spring immediately. You may add other left-behind cards to your hand.&#10;&#10;You place ghost cards into the mansion when they appear at the top of the draw pile. Ghost cards are placed face up beneath room cards so players can read ghosts' names and see the toy icons on the tops of the cards.&#10;&#10;To trap ghosts you must have Toy cards. Each ghost card is marked with a toy icon. If you are in a room with a ghost and you have its corresponding toy in your hand, you immediately trap the ghost and put it, along with the toy card, in front of you to keep score.&#10;&#10;When you trap a ghost, you must see if another ghost in the house becomes enraged. To do this, flip over the 2-card stack you made at the beginning of the game that corresponds with the toy you used to trap the ghost. If the revealed ghost is in the mansion, flip its card over to its enraged (red) side. Every enraged ghost in the house reduces the hand limit by 1 card. If the hand limit reaches 0 cards, no players win. The ghosts take the game.&#10;&#10;"
