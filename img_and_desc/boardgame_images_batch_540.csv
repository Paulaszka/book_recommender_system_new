For instance every card is a Face Card and there are no Kings or Queens, Jacks nor Aces. The Royalty here or the Ace of the Race is represented by what horse is the Winner of the Race. These cards wear Silks not Suits.&#10;&#10;This is the only game that tells you the Winners before you Start. The only question is who holds the Winning hand. The objective of the Play is to determine if You hold a Winning hand and have a chance to take home the Cash. The Rules are Simple but you can't Win if you don't Try and it's obviously better if you Trifecta!&#10;&#10;The rules are simple in the basic form of play however, all sorts of other cards games can be played with this new game.&#10;Here are the rules:&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;Trifecta Poker Hand Rankings&#10;&#10;Trifecta Poker can be played using almost any variation of common Poker Play rules. The Key to Trifecta Poker is that the winning hand is based on a Trifecta of winning Horse Cards.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;Dealer shuffles the 52 Cards and draws 3 different Horse Cards in a vertical display outward from the POT known as the&nbsp;Trifecta Flop.&nbsp;After each play the cards are shuffled and a new Trifecta Flop is drawn. The First Horse drawn is the Winning Horse, the 2nd is the Place and the 3rd is the Show - aka WPS. or a Superfecta game a 4th Horse is drawn.&nbsp;Duplicate Horse cards if they appear in the Flop are returned to the deck. Dealer then re-shuffles the remaining deck and deals 5 cards to each player. Players may now hold pat their original cards or draw from one to four new cards from the deck. The Player with the highest combinations of Trifecta, Quinella, or WPS card combinations wins. A Trifecta is all three winning horses, a Quinella is the Win and Place horses, and the WPS are any horses in the money. WPS combinations are ranked by the highest number of Horse cards in the money without a Trifecta or Quinella.&#10;&#10;All Trifecta Poker hand rankings can be improved by also holding typical Poker combinations as shown below:&#10;&#10;    For instance no. 1 : A Trifecta with a pair of any horses beats a Trifecta with no pair.&#10;    For instance no. 2: A Win horse with three of a kind beats a Win horse with a pair.&#10;    If NO players hold WPS Cards typical Poker Hand rankings are won as follows:&#10;    Four of a Kind - Four of the same Horse cards.&#10;    Full House- Three of a kind and a pair. The player with the higher value three of a kind, wins in the event of a tie. If both players have the same three of a kind then the player with the highest pair wins.&#10;    Straight -Five cards of any horses in ascending order with the higher straight wins the tie.&#10;    Three of a Kind- Simply three cards of the same horse.&#10;    Two Pairs of Horses - The player holding the highest pair takes the pot in the event that more than one player is holding two pairs. If two players are both holding the same two pair then the player with the highest fifth horse (i.e. the kicker) takes the pot.&#10;    One Pair of Horses-Two cards of the same horse.&#10;    HIGH Horse -Highest card takes all in the event there is a complete absence of the above hands.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

It shows a grid of 4x7 squares and two starting spaces. On the grid are placed 28 magnetic flower pieces. Players take turns rolling a die. If the active player rolls a flower colour, he/she may move his/her player piece (also magnetic) until it reaches a flower of the corresponding colour. Pieces may only be moved either vertically or horizontally, and it may not jump over the other player's piece or the rose piece. If it reaches a flower of the colour on the die roll, the player wins that flower. If he can't reach a flower of the current colour, he/she may move their piece to an empty space. If a player rolls the rose symbol, he gets to move the rose piece. The rose can only be plucked once all the other flowers have been taken. In this phase of the game, there are no more die rolls. Each player gets to move once per round. While the other flowers are worth one point, the rose is worth three points.&#10;The game ends when all flowers have been plucked. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
