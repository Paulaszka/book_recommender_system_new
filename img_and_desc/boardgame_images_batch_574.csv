Gameplay goes around resources. There are two types of resources: Countable resources like food, wood, stone, ore, test-tube and gold. Special resources like horse, iron, fish, wheat, marble, diamond and mana are used to develop (science) or build (building) something. There is no storage for resources, a player needs to have access (by having a city near the resource) to certain number and type of resources to build something. Food is the most important resource, each city, extra population and army eats one food. You need food-surplus to build a city/army/extra population, but no problem if your food production goes under your food production (no starving to death).&#10;&#10;Each player has an economical page (like character page in RPGs), that shows the state of his empire. Players use small  markers (for example: coins) for recording various things.&#10;&#10;Player's turn have 4 phases:&#10;&#10;     random event phase: A random event happens, that has effect to all players, usually a positive thing to each player.&#10;     money phase: Player adds the number of his/her gold production to treasury. (Gold is the only resource in Isle of Domination, that is storaged.)&#10;     army moving phase: Players can move their armies by grid lines of hexes. Combat system is very simple: if attacker's army is stronger than defender army, defender army has to be withdrawn. No dice rolling this time. Army power is based on sciences, and have modifiers by terrain, city or buildings.&#10;     building phase: Player can build a city (on a hex edge occupied by an army), increase population, build an army, develop a science and/or build a building in this phase.&#10;&#10;&#10;The goal of this game is to reach one of the six Victory Conditions. It is possible that all other Players have stronger economies, stronger armies and bigger empires, but still you win because you reach one of the Victory Conditions.&#10;There are 6 different types of Victory:&#10;&#10;     Territory Victory: You dominate by having a large number of cities.&#10;     Military Victory: You dominate by having a very strong and large army.&#10;     Population Victory: You dominate by outnumbering others in population.&#10;     Science Victory: You dominate by knowledge. (You develop Future Science 2.)&#10;     Cultural Victory: You dominate by your people's cultural influence. (You build Cathedral.)&#10;     Magical Victory: You dominate by magical superiority. (You have a city near every Mana resource.)&#10;&#10;&#10;Informational page contains exact numbers regarding the conditions above.&#10;&#10;Game map has a random factor - dice-rolls determine one extra resource for each hex. This way, certain resources may have shortage or abundance, so diferent strategies can succeed in each game.&#10;Randomized map preparation may make some of the Victory types easier than others. But when several players pursuit the same victory, it will be much more difficult to achieve it.&#10;&#10;"

142014,,"For centuries, the two kingdoms of F and B have fought each other in a peculiar way. Whenever war is declared, The Flag of The Old Empire is placed in the middle of The Ground, the contested borderland between the two kingdoms, and the two armies engage in battle to take control of The Flag and carry it into the opponent's lands: the first army to do so is declared victorious.&#10;&#10;A Fair Battleground is a non-historical wargame set in a pseudo-Napoleonic era. To win, you must push the opposing army back or outmaneuver it, so that your own army can advance and eventually carry The Flag into the other player&rsquo;s territory. Meanwhile, the opponent can engage you in battles to stop your advancement and try to take control of The Flag.&#10;&#10;In A Fair Battleground, skillful deployment and maneuvering is more important than raw impact, but typical winning tactical moves of the era like attacking the opposing armies from behind are forbidden. Asymmetry between players is given not by a different mix of forces or objectives, but rather by the interplay of two pairs of opposing roles (Advancing vs Contending and Attacker vs Defender) that the two players take and exchange during the game. These roles determine both what the players can do and when they can do it, as well as which of the different armies are more useful to each of them.&#10;&#10;Battle resolution is basically luck-less, but a simple optional rule that adds a random factor is provided for players who prefer luck-based systems.&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;A Fair Battleground is a print-and-play game that uses a board and 20 counters; the players must supply 9 euro-cubes or similar objects to be used as markers, and, optionally, two six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;A Fair Battleground was an entry in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest.&#10;&#10;"

One card is slid below the King in the middle of the table and the rest are shuffled into the deck.  The King has hidden his only heir to the throne (one of the 4 cards the players just saw) and it is up to you to find them.  As you draw a card into your hand and play a card to family lineage lines on the table, you begin to prove which peasants and nobles are not related to the King, the hidden one becomes more apparent to everyone, as more cards are played to the table.&#10;Your family lineage lines on the table prove which people are not royal heirs. Players must complete family lines with a family crest card (to score extra points)  before the other player slaps the King and names the hidden heir.   You must decide between quickly exposing the King's secret before your opponent can play the right cards.. or making sure your family lines are complete so you score more points.

Inside each box, an apprentice will find a succession scroll. Contained on the scroll is the last piece of knowledge required to become the Drago Magi &mdash; but only one can claim the title. Each scroll holds a different &quot;Spell of Succession&quot; that may be executed only with the correct combination of rare gems. These magically imbued gems appear in sets of three only during times of succession and must be collected by dragons at the command of each apprentice. The competitor who is first to collect the gems needed to complete his Spell of Succession becomes the new Drago Magi.

To start, each player selects an apprentice dragon mage he wishes to play. Each mage receives a deck of dragon cards that includes multiple copies of four different chromatic dragons (Green, Red, Black &amp; Purple), four different metallic dragons (Gold, Silver, Brass &amp; Bronze), and two special dragon cards (the Battle dragon and the Polar dragon). Each dragon has a different strength, weakness and special ability. Players will send their dragons, one at a time, to capture gems on different battlefields; each battlefield offers a different effect that may give an advantage or disadvantage to certain types of dragons.&#10;&#10;Players alternate playing dragon cards on battlefields until they have played all eight of their Dragon cards. Each player can play a maximum of three dragons on a single battlefield. When a dragon is placed, it may make a ranged attack. Not all dragons have a ranged attack breath weapon, but those that do have a breath weapon icon with a number. The number indicates the number of battle cards the player may reveal when attempting to hit with a ranged attack. A defender may defend with the number of cards equal to the dragon's shield value. A ranged attack can take place immediately only when the card is played against an opposing dragon. If a ranged attack is not used at this moment, the ranged attack is forfeited for the current round.&#10;&#10;After all dragon cards have been played, the melee phase of the battle begins. Each dragon has a &quot;melee attack&quot; value printed on its card which represents the number of battle cards the player can draw for the battle. The melee battle mechanism is a unique attack and counter system that provides opportunity for deduction, subtlety, and deadly combos. Players will also earn advance battle cards that build up their decks over the course of the game. The player with the most dragons present on a battlefield wins that gem. In the case of a tie, the dragons and gem remain for the next round.&#10;&#10;Draco Magi is a fast game heavily connected to its theme that incorporates area control, bluffing, hand management, deck building and deduction.&#10;&#10;"

The first person to finish saying a correct answer wins the face-off and takes the opponent's card into a face down &quot;winnings&quot; pile.  Since cards are played on top of each other, the player who lost the face-off reveals an earlier card on their stack and may immediately match another player's card causing a cascade of face-offs.&#10;&#10;In addition there are wildcards which allow different symbols to match until it is overwritten by another wildcard which may then trigger a whole new set of face-offs.  Play continues until the deck is exhausted and whoever has the most cards in their &quot;winnings pile&quot; is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;ANOMIA PARTY EDITION&#10;&#10;Feed your Anomia addiction!&#10;&#10;Diehard Anomia fans and novices alike will love the Anomia Party Edition, featuring 6 all-new decks and over 425 unique categories, plus customizable blank cards for adding your own categories in every deck!&#10;&#10;Play the Party Edition decks on their own or intermingle them with the original decks for hours of mad fun!&#10;&#10;Anomia is simple.
