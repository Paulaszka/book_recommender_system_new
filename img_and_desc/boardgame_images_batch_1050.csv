Everyone who was anyone in the industry had come together for the new edition of the &quot;Schlager-Megaparade&quot;. The Christmas edition of Germany's most successful TV entertainment show was to be recorded in midsummer of all times. For it neither costs nor efforts were spared! Presenter and pop star Michael Prinz would again present a mix of well-known stars and promising newcomers. The show with snow cannons and a skating reindeer ballet should not only provide for Christmas mood in the living rooms of the spectators, but also strongly boost the record sales of the performing artists.&#10;&#10;The recording began punctually at 6:30 p.m. in the sold-out Magdeburg Stadthalle. All the artists were eagerly awaiting their turn. But shortly after the show began, a shrill scream echoed through the hall: a production assistant had found the artist Janine Bayer dead in her dressing room. The singer, who had won the industry award &quot;Der Goldene Gockel&quot; a few weeks ago, was supposed to present her new No. 1 hit &quot;Ich tr&auml;um von mir heut Nacht&quot; that evening.&#10;&#10;Of course, you immediately called an ambulance and the police. But the emergency services that were called in could only determine Janine's death. Apparently, the victim was beaten to death with her own prize statue. While you now wait for your interrogation, you are left on your own with the question: What happened that day? How could this hit fest end so tragically?&#10;&#10;&#10;         Players&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;4 female and 3 male roles (with 7 people).

All players start off as Human and explore the board to be the first to survive 12 months of the Apocalypse. However, the Zombie City and Vampire Graveyard is out there and players who discover these locations become those fearsome horrors. And if that&rsquo;s not enough to make you fret, then have fun dodging the pesky meteorites that continually change the course of the game!&#10;&#10;At the start of a player&rsquo;s turn, they roll the 6-sided Movement Dice and move that many spaces. If they land on an unexplored space, they pull at random a location and build the map. Locations can consist of Elements, Villages, Mountains, Zombie City, or Vampire Graveyard. Then, for a Human player, they decide how to use any collected Elements to work toward Survival Points or decide to attack another player before ending their turn. On a Zombie&rsquo;s turn, they roll the movement dice, moving 1 less than the number rolled, but can control up to 6 Zombies in a single turn. Their turn ends when all movements and attacks are used.  For the Vampire, they roll the movement dice, moving 1 more than the number rolled, and decide whether to Suck Blood for Energy or Attack a player using Energy to obtain a Coffin. Their turn ends when all movements or attacks are used.&#10;&#10;In the scenario a player rolls a SURVIVE! on the Movement Dice, they immediately roll the two Coordinate dice to determine where a Meteorite or Supply Crate lands on the board before concluding that player&rsquo;s turn automatically.&#10;&#10;The Game ends when a Player achieves the requirements to survive the apocalypse. For the Human, it&rsquo;s collecting 12 months of Supplies (a combination of Elements, Supply Crates, and Defenses). For the Zombie, it&rsquo;s Replicating in each Human Village and returning all 6 Zombies to the City. And the Vampire must obtain Blood Drops and all 5 Human Coffins before concluding their turn in the Graveyard.&#10;&#10;"

The planet cannot give enough resources to sustain all living tribes. So the tribes will enter a trial to decide who will become the favored tribe. So, the goal of the game is to gain as much Godly favor as possible.&#10;&#10;Players are scavenging tribes that collect powerful gemstones during their turn on the floating islands of the Broken Planet. A player's standard turn consists of movement and gemstone collection. Movement is performed by secretly choosing an island number on the game board with your compass and then keeping it hidden until all other tribes have chosen a location. Afterwards, everybody reveals their location and performs the movement at the same time. Tribes will find different temples on the islands, each displaying the gemstone type that can be collected there. After adding the collected gems to their hand, a new turn starts and players repeat these steps.&#10;&#10;Each round, one tribe will enter the 'Offer Phase' and may discard gemstones cards for special actions.  These actions include building temples for unique effects, creating relics to gain Godly favor, or attacking other players with a divine strike. Each of these actions can gain favor in their own respective way. The offering player cannot move nor collect, but all other tribes can! The offering role is passed down clockwise each turn. The amount of discarded gemstones depends on the costs of the Offer Phase actions.&#10;&#10;All players play simultaneously! So it's key to see what gemstones other players need for their actions, and what gems they already have in order to predict their next moves.&#10;&#10;The game ends after X turns depending on the amount of players. When the last round has been played, each player counts their favor. The player with the most favor wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The player who wins the most money loses the game, because they get picked up by the police. So the real winner is the player with the second highest score.&#10;&#10;Before play starts, a line of cards is laid out (similar to !nversion), and this dictates the lead suit for each trick. However, players can alter the line by paying bribes. In this way, players can win tricks unexpectedly.&#10;&#10;"

Players are witches bringing different ingredients to brew up potions.&#10;&#10;Play follows the normal method for tricks. However, players are trying to reach but not exceed a total of 15. The cards players earn from winning tricks depend on the total value of the trick. If it is under or on 15, that's okay, but going over 15 causes trouble.&#10;&#10;Further, if the player's final score is over 15, they cannot win. But by obtaining all five ingredients, a player can neutralise the potion and discard to alter their score.&#10;&#10;The publisher has put English rules online.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Players bid simultaneously with money cards in a series of auctions. But matching bids cancel each other (butting) in the manner of What the Heck?. So the auction can be won by a player with a low bid.&#10;&#10;All bid cards are discarded, until the player exhausts their hand or spends a special token, to refill their hand. By careful choice, a player can know what cards other players have, and manage their own bids successfully.&#10;&#10;Players spend cash when they win bids on auction items. Not running out of money too soon is a challenge.&#10;&#10;Further, players have two secret cards of winning conditions they want to meet, such as winning different values or combos of items. For example, winning two pairs of items scores 5 bonus points, or a run of items valued 1-3 to get 3 bonus points.&#10;&#10;At the end of the auction rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

The game box shows a sail boat on Lake Ashi, which looks strangely familiar.&#10;&#10;In FuertoRite, players follow normal trick-taking rules, but with some changes. Players draw more cards as they play, so ending with more hand cards than when they started.&#10;&#10;Further, players draft cards with their neighbors during the game. This mix of drawing, drafting and hand management gives the game a different feel.&#10;&#10;Scoring is based on which cards players win, but only the smallest set counts, so players must be careful to balance their winnings.&#10;&#10;"
