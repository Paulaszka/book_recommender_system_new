On a turn, you roll three dice, with each die face showing a balloon color and a shape, then record the results by circling numbers from the bottom of the column, going up. The highest number you circle in a column equals the points that you score.&#10;&#10;Not happy with your results? Then roll again with any number of dice &mdash; but you have to roll an additional die as well, which means you'll circle more results on your scoresheet. You can reroll a second time as well to add a fifth die to your results. This (possibly) gives you better control over the results, while helping you ascend the columns more quickly to higher potential scores.&#10;&#10;However, at the top of each column is a different colored number that's much lower than the numbers immediately below it. Hit this number, and your balloon's popped because it went too high. What's more, this popping triggers a scoring break that occurs at the end of the round, with everyone scoring based on their current heights in the columns. You want to go high, but don't trigger the break or else your points will plummet right before scoring.&#10;&#10;After three breaks, players total their scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;"

The teams are represented by coloured plastic miniatures, and push-fit assembly is required before use. The game is expandable, and additional rules and teams will be made available through expansion sets and supplements.&#10;&#10;Actions in the game are resolved through the use of dice. Regular six-sided dice are used to make tests in a number of cases, such as when a player attempts to pick up the ball, pass it, catch it or dodge past an enemy player. Custom dice are used when one player wishes to Block another, using graphics to represent each of the different (but all violent) potential outcomes.&#10;&#10;The rules in this edition of Blood Bowl are almost identical to those found in the Competition Rules Pack, which was the culmination of several years of development of the Blood Bowl Living Rulebook. This has resulted in an incredibly well-honed game which sees regular competition play around the world. In fact each team takes turns moving, blocking and advancing the football down the field. The game comes with plastic miniatures.&#10;&#10;This game is a part of the Blood Bowl Series.&#10;&#10;"

You have just been invited to play A House in New Orleans A game for 2-6 players. Some will call it a player deduction game or a game with a traitor mechanism, but most will call it horrifyingly intense. &#10;You are invited to A House in New Orleans come hungry.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in an old mansion in New Orleans. Each room contains two item cards face down. Players select unique characters with special abilities and stats. They will move from room to room discovering items. Some may be traps that impede players, some may be special items that improve a character. You may only choose to carry one item, so every room will provide a new discovery and a decision.&#10;&#10;Human Goal:&#10;Players are attempting to find all three items that their character requires. When one player finds all three items the game is over.  If all but one player has 2 items, the game is over as well. Each of the collected items has a point value and the points are totaled at the end of the game. You must be careful what items you choose to collect, if the items you collect are of too low a point value a player with fewer items may still win.&#10;&#10;Vampire goal:&#10;Did I mention a lonely vampire has disguised themselves among the dinner guests? The goal for the original vampire is not to acquire items themselves, but to &quot;Turn&quot; human players that have already acquired items. You see, nothing tastes as good as hope. If a human is attacked and can&rsquo;t fend off the vampire, they are now secretly a vampire themselves looking for their victim. If the vampire is successfully fended off the vampire is not &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; and may become invisible (hidden player movement).  If the vampire turns a player, the new vampire gains points for the items they have already acquired but give the Vampire that turned them points as well. They do not give their &quot;Parent&quot; vampire points from the new victims they acquire. The closer a human player is to completing their goal the more valuable they are, but the more human players you &quot;Turn&quot; the more competition you make for yourself.  If you wait too long, they may be able to fend you off&#10;&#10;The Clock:&#10;The old grandfather clock gongs on the hour, at which time a new event card is turned over. These events are random but become worse for the humans as the game progresses. The humans may skip an event if they place an item that turn. Do you help the other humans even though it may mean losing the game to avoid the next horrible event..it is up to you.&#10;&#10;Does it sound simple? It is simple to learn, and as complex as the mind of the players that you play against.&#10;&#10;"

As is the case in any tragic event, there are those whom will use the circumstances to their advantage. Under the veil of the witch-hunt lie other motivations; power, greed, revenge and righteousness.&#10;&#10;AFFLICTION: Salem 1692 is a game set in the hysteria of a witch-hunt. Use your influence to whisper in the ear of the magistrate, judge, governor or minister to protect some and have others arrested. Salem was a chance to gain property, exact revenge and prove one&rsquo;s righteousness.&#10;&#10;The characters in the game were actual residents of the Salem region. This is the closest possible simulation of actual events in a game to date.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: Players will take turns placing a &quot;messenger&quot; (worker) to select actions. After all workers are placed, actions will be resolved in the order they appear on the main board.&#10;&#10;EXONERATE - Take 2 Accusation Tokens off of any Colonist.&#10;FIRST PLAYER TOKEN/PROTECTION - Use a letter from the Governor to prevent one Colonist from being arrested and take the First turn, next turn.&#10;GAIN INFLUENCE/USE COLONIST ABILITY - Generate Influence and use the abilities of Colonists that you have in your Circle.&#10;ARREST - Spend Influence equal to a Colonist's adjusted Reputation to Arrest.&#10;SPECTRAL EVIDENCE - Use this token to prevent a Colonist from Generating Influence and using their Colonist ability.&#10;ACCUSE - Place accusation tokens to reduce Colonist's Reputations to make them easier to arrest.&#10;GAIN/REMOVE FEAR - Gain Fear Tokens or remove a fear token from another player (used to weaken Colonists)&#10;BRING COLONIST INTO CIRCLE - Spend Influence equal to a Colonists Base Reputation and bring them into your Circle.&#10;&#10;Play will cycle between accusing, arresting and protecting your interests. Fear provides an alternative way to function when necessary.&#10;&#10;END GAME: Increase Mather and Mary Spencer Hill are shuffled in with the bottom 6 cards of the Colonist deck. When either of them appears in the play area, the game immediately ends.&#10;&#10;VICTORY CONDITIONS: All players will receive victory points for the Reputation value of each Colonist that have arrested or brought into their circle, victory points for the property of those they have had arrested and for the number of influence tokens they have at the end of the game. Each player will also receive points for having specific families arrested or protected, depending on the player tile they are given.&#10;&#10;"

Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.&#10;&#10;Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way, some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn, the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.&#10;&#10;The country boards are also noteworthy, in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn, and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer, after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.&#10;&#10;A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season. The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies.&#10;&#10;In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction.&#10;&#10;A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with &quot;character&quot; keyples and keypers will also be released.&#10;&#10;"

An Exit Card is randomly drawn and placed faced down in the middle of the table.

All Tool Tokens are also placed individually at the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Everyone closes their eyes.

If they match, the player wins the game. Otherwise, that player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;When a player is eliminated, all his Exit Cards and Tool Tokens are returned to the center of the table, and the game resumes.&#10;&#10;A second way to get eliminated for the game is through bluffing. When a player bluffs and is challenged, the defender and the challenger must show each other their Character Cards. Whoever loses the challenge is eliminated and gives the winner all his Exit Cards and Tool Tokens. The winner may also assume the loser's Character Card.&#10;&#10;Will you be the survivor of Escape from Enigma?&#10;&#10;"

Each turn players choose from one of their 5 witches in a blind reveal mechanism. Each witch allows the collection of ingredient cards (to collect as sets) and condiment cards (to increase the value of specific sets). However, each witch picks specific types of cards and incorrectly deduce who earlier players pick and you may be left with nothing to pick up! The &quot;recipe&quot; cards included also give secret bonuses for concocting specific ingredient/condiment (potion) combinations which allow for great replayability and strategic depth.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Will you get what you want, or what you deserve?&#10;&#10;In this 18-card game, players each have a character card and two or three gift cards (depending on player count) face down on the table in front of them. When it is your turn you may either swap one of your face-down cards with one elsewhere on the table, or turn a card face-up, possibly activating a special action on the gift cards. The round ends when more than half of the players have revealed their cards or when a bomb is revealed, at which point everyone scores points if they have collected the gifts wanted by their characters.&#10;&#10;The twist comes from the bombs: only one of the character scores highly if she collects bombs, but other characters score nothing for the round if they have one.&#10;&#10;After an agreed number of rounds, the player with the highest total score is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
