Even before the armistice with Germany ended the fighting along the Western Front in WWI, British, French and US forces were deployed to attack Soviet controlled Russia to undermine and perhaps overthrow the Communists from power in Russia. One of the more daring Allied attacks occurred when a British flotilla of Coastal Motor Boats (CMB) was dispatched to raid the Soviet occupied naval base of Kronstadt. The raiders were supported by aircraft launched by the world&rsquo;s first aircraft carrier, HMS Vindictive, making this one of the first combined air/sea attacks in military history.&#10;&#10;Soviet warships based at Kronstadt safeguarded St. Petersburg (soon to be renamed Leningrad), and were severely contesting Allied warships in the Baltic. The harbor was considered one of the most heavily fortified ports in Europe, and many in the British Admiralty considered the raid a suicidal gamble. The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the British ships and aircraft. You must endeavor to overcome the Soviet defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or fleeing, and then escaping with those vessels and aircraft that survive. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

As faction leaders, players vie for control of a future Europe that is a shell of its former glory. Build a deck that matches your faction's play style and take back the continent!&#10;&#10;Each player controls a different faction leader with unique abilities and a unique starting deck. The leader you choose determines how you score victory points to win the game. Regardless, all leaders score a bulk of their points through conquest. On your turn, select an action by placing one of your tokens on the action board. Actions fall into one of three categories: Train (add cards to your deck), Reorganize (manipulate your deck), and Assault (attack territories). Action slots are limited, so it is essential to plan ahead and guess your opponents' moves.&#10;&#10;Dealers in Hope uses several types of cards, with some types, i.e., professional cards, being selected randomly and others coming from the game's preset deck suggestions. Each set of professional cards has three levels &mdash; level 1, level 2, and master &mdash; and you must Train these increasingly powerful cards in order. Battles are fought via back-and-forth card play. Cards contain attack, defense, support, and (often) effects. The attacker plays as many cards as desired from their hand, then the defender gets a single chance to play cards in defense. Finally, the attacker gets one more chance to beat the defender. The winner gains/holds the territory, along with bonuses associated with that territory.&#10;&#10;Unlike many games of this type, Dealers in Hope focuses not only on the military side of warfare, but also on the people behind the scenes: the civilians, masses, etc. who affect and are affected by the campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Indeed there is some overlap in the period covered with that covered by Esprit de Corps, and complete overlap with A House Divided which is specifically honed to bring out the historical nuances and characteristics of the American Civil War. That is deliberate and in the latter case unavoidable given the broader canvas which Power and Glory seeks to address. For battles in the Crimea or the Indian Mutiny, for example, you have the choice to use either Esprit de Corps or Power and Glory for your wargames, the outcome will be more or less the same. Later in our period casualty rates increased with the widespread introduction of efficient breech-loading firearms and artillery and more effective machine-guns, and there was a resulting tendency to employ a somewhat more dispersed deployment of troops in the line of battle, all of which are accurately taken into account in these rules. Of course the development of Power and Glory' has benefited enormously from the experience of the authors with the two previous publications in the Esprit de Corps series and with rule books in the parallel Warlord series covering warfare in earlier periods of history.&#10;&#10;Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are at the heart of these rules, just as they are in others in the Esprit de Corps and Warlord series. Though the effect of firepower is awesome, you cannot merely rely on defensive tactics alone for success. So be bold, exploit your chain of command to best advantage, concentrate your troops where it matters most, be aggressive where you can but defend resolutely where you must, and make best use of ground at all times. You can have great fun with these rules and your games will be fast and furious.&#10;&#10;Authentic historical accuracy brings to life the character and atmosphere of combat in the wars of the second half of the 19th Century.&#10;Fast action games at every level in all theatres of war.&#10;Detailed and carefully calibrated troop classification accurately reproducing the characteristics of the units and&#10;soldiers in each and every war world-wide.&#10;Comprehensive coverage of combat formations and weaponry.&#10;Figures based in standard multiples as elements - no need to re-base your troops.&#10;Summary Starter Rules to get you into action fast.&#10;Fully detailed and comprehensive explanation in the Main Rules.&#10;Many worked examples of how the rules operate plus numerous explanatory diagrams.&#10;Complete example battle account - 'Action at El Teb'.&#10;Carefully crafted and entirely internally consistent for speedy action and exciting games.&#10;Essentially simple D6 based rules systems common with others in the Esprit de Corps Series - play one play them all!&#10;Alternate movement facilitates fast play.&#10;Command &amp; control - recreating the difficulties and frustrations of command on the battlefield with a fully functioning chain of command from the C-in-C to the unit CO.&#10;Example army lists and guidelines on how to put together your miniature armies.&#10;Bolt on, fully compatible additional rules in a separate Appendix taking you on into the early 20th Century.&#10;Fast and easy access to all aspects of the rules - cross referenced and indexed throughout.&#10;Playsheets included for hassle-free, rapid manoeuvre and swift combat resolution on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are right at the centre of things. As a result there's quite a lot to get to grips with in this rulebook, but don't worry, the rule systems and mechanisms are basically simple and quick to use.&#10;&#10;The rules are all about command and control, the absolute core of the Esprit de Corps system. You have to prompt your troops into action and at times restrain them from recklessly forgetting their orders. It enables the opposing sides to move alternately while retaining the potential for each to outmanoeuvre the other and for tactical surprise on the battlefield. As the action develops you will find more and more demands falling on your generals, drawing on their reserves of command and control. If the latter run out, your army will rapidly disintegrate and suffer defeat. Movement is rapid, each move representing from 10 to 15 minutes of action on the battlefield, and though ranges are significant, there is still plenty of scope for the use of manoeuvre to outplay your opponent, especially if your terrain is thoughtfully designed to accurately recreate that in the real theatre of operations you are depicting.&#10;&#10;The systems for shooting, monitoring morale and determining the outcomes of attacks, melees and pursuits are simple, internally consistent and robust, so that they quick to resolve yet give an outcome which is appropriate and sensitive to the tactical situation, and, importantly, historically authentic. Normal (D6) dice are used for all transactions involving a random element (a die roll) throughout the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

There are 355 uncut counters.&#10;&#10;One unusual feature of the system is the turn sequence. The Soviets move, attack, and then move reserve units, after which the Germans move reserve units, the Soviets attack again, and then the Germans move non-reserve units and attack. Units are designated reserve or not at the start of each player's normal movement phase.&#10;&#10;Another unusual feature is the movement system; German units have normal movement allowances but Soviet units do not. On the first turn of the game the Soviet player has movement points to distribute, but after that each unit's movement allowance is determined by the combination of a die roll and its distance from its HQ.&#10;&#10;"

There are 244 uncut counters. Units are mostly battalions. Turns are twelve hours.&#10;&#10;Turns follow a sequence of twelve phases including American air attacks, German artillery barrages, standard movement and combat, exploitation, and camouflage. In the latter phase German stacks can attempt to camouflage themselves under certain conditions, which helps protect them from air attacks. Camouflaged units move more slowly and cannot attack.&#10;&#10;The combat system is quite complex with many different types of modifiers and column shifts (terrain, combined arms, different armor types, etc.) and a wide range of possible effects.&#10;&#10;There is a nine-turn campaign game and several shorter scenarios.&#10;&#10;"

All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Determine Starting Point - Roll 2 d6 that are different colors. Use the darker die for determining the columns and the lighter die for determining the rows. Find coordinating locations on the Dungeon Map. Choose one and mark an X on the Dungeon Map to show your starting point for this life. If a 6 is rolled on the die, it is a wild for that row or column, and you may choose any location while still following the other die rolled.

You may never retrace your steps or go onto a space that you have previously X&rsquo;ed. &#10;- If you enter a square/room with an icon that you have upgraded to, you earn a treasure. Mark an X over one of the Treasure. Each Treasure is worth 2 Victory Points.&#10;- You may X squares/rooms that have icons you have not unlocked yet, you just will not earn that Treasure this game.&#10;- There are &ldquo;Upgrade Arrows&rdquo; throughout the map.   If you ever enter one of these spaces, you immediately mark the next X on any one Upgrade track&#10;&#10;How Upgrading Works:&#10;- There are four skill tracks to advance to upgrade your Cat throughout the game.&#10;- Upgrade from left to right, marking an X in the leftmost empty square corresponding to the die.&#10;- Once a square with an icon in it is X&rsquo;ed, you now have that skill. When entering spaces in the Dungeon Map with that icon, you now earn Treasure.&#10;- Once a skill track has been upgraded 9 times, you unlock a unique ability to use once during each Cat&rsquo;s life. &#10;- Upgrades remain for the entire game.&#10;&#10;End of Game: After you have used your last Cat (9 lives), the game is over. Total your score. Each Treasure earned is worth 2 Victory Points. Earn corresponding Victory Points for each Upgrade unlocked (On each skill track, first unlock is 1 VP, second unlock is an additional 2 VP, third unlock is an additional 3 VP). Total your Victory Points for the two End Goals that were rolled during Setup. The player with the most Victory Points is the winner!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Mechanically, the game includes several dry erase cards with outlines of various potential mascot shapes, and a series of cards with three choices of traits for the city (e.g. it is known for its shipping industry).&#10;&#10;The start player chooses 1 of 4 types of cards, and one of the traits on it for all players to represent on their mascot cards.  Once all the players are finished drawing, the next player chooses a card.  The process repeats for a third card as well.  Once everyone has named their drawing, the players discuss and vote on which would be best to represent the town.  Points are earned, and the player with the most points after 3 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;"

What will you fill that board with? Animals, of course, with the game including six types of animals on 1x1 tiles as well as a dozen animals on 1x2 and 2x1 tiles.&#10;&#10;In each of the three rounds, you're going to use a worker-placement style system to acquire animals tiles, guest cubes, special action cards, door tokens, and more. Guests come in six colors: five of which match five of the animal colors (and these guests only want to see those types of animals), and a sixth color (white) that doesn't care what type of animal they see. Those are the guests you want most, but of course to acquire them, you must give up other things.&#10;&#10;Many of the animal tiles have walls along one or more edge, and these tiles should be placed against other tiles with walls. During the round, you'll place the animal tiles that you've acquired on the board, with these tiles touching one of the four entrances around the perimeter of your zoo, and before the round ends, you'll &quot;lead&quot; the guests through your zoo, with the red cube stopping at the red (carnivorous) animal, the blue cube stopping at the blue animal, and so on.&#10;&#10;You might need to snake your way around doors that block direct access to an animal, or you might have a door token that lets you cut through. When you don't have a matching guest for the next animal (or vice versa), the tour that day is done.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, the game ends, with players possibly scoring extra points based on their final bonus card, such as the number of rows and columns in your zoo that are filled or the number of rows that have four or five different types of animals.&#10;&#10;Solitaire rules are included with 5x5 Zoo.&#10;&#10;"
