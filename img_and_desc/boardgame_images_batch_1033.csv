It is possible to overtake only after the end of the overtaking ban.&#10;     Traffic light - the game contains a dice that has colors on the sides - red, yellow and green. When a player arrives at the intersection square with a traffic light, he must roll this dice and may not continue until he is green.&#10;     Speed &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;limit - a player who moves in this part of the road counts only half the value of his dice roll.&#10;     No stop sign - if a player ends his turn on this square, he must pay one coin fine.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game also contains red wooden chips that represent money. At the beginning of the game, the players distribute them evenly. When playing, the places where fines are paid are defined - for example, No stop sign.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who reaches the finish line first and at the same time has at least one more money - so he did not spend everything on fines.&#10;&#10;"

Relive an ancient tale and lead your people home before they&rsquo;re lost to the blizzard. 12 maps are included, with millions more to discover.&#10;&#10;The goal is to lead 3 of your pieces home before your rival. Players take turns sliding 1 of their pieces across the board. There are no captures or jumps, but players' pieces will keep sliding on open tiles if they move in a direction until they would run into something. When you lead a piece home, that's one less piece on the board to block your rival. Every piece on the board may help or halt your progress.&#10;&#10;While Nersha has several board layouts that ship with the game, players can decide to change the board or the number of pieces to play with, among other aspects. There are also seven different tile types that can add more complexity to mapmaking.&#10;&#10;This game is designed to bridge between casual or abstract games you learn as a kid with daunting games like chess, bringing together all playstyles.&#10;&#10;"
