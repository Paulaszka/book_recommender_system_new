If there is no previously played card, then you can play any card. Continue taking turns and discarding cards until someone does not have a special card or an equal/higher floor, meaning they must pick up the entire discard pile and add it to their hand. Players must keep at least 3 cards in their hand at all times, replenishing from the remainder of the deck. The special cards, including New Building, Stuck, Penthouse, Door Closed, and Down to the Lobby, throw exciting twists and turns.&#10;Once the deck has been completely used up and players finish playing the cards in their hand, they move onto the face up cards, leaving them for all to see. The rules are the same for this section, but their hand can be seen by other players. Once they've gotten rid of their face up cards, it is time to play their face down cards. When it is their turn, the player will flip a card onto the discard pile. If it is an equal/higher floor or a special card, then shout &quot;YAY&quot; or any other celebratory exclamation. If it does not, then put on your game face and pick up the entire discard pile, adding it to your hand. The first player out of cards WINS!&#10;&#10;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

As in Venice, the islands of Murano are separated by canals, so gondolas and transportation are at the heart of this game.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts the islands of Murano, with the islands being divided up into building sites and walkways. Surrounding the islands is a series of action spaces, with gondolas being present in some number of them at the start of play. On a turn, you move one of the gondolas in the direction of play to an empty space, then take the action shown there. You can't pass another gondola while moving or land in an occupied space, but for a coin you can move a gondola that's in front of the gondola you want to move, and you can pay to move multiple gondolas, if needed.&#10;&#10;Some actions place shops on the islands, with shops coming in different types. You mark a shop to show ownership, and when tourists show up later, they will shop at various stores depending on their proximity and the goods they offer. You also need to take actions to move your personal gondolas to islands so that you can take actions there.&#10;&#10;Why are you doing all of this activity? To score victory point cards in hand, and actions on the board will let you gain additional VP cards to give you direction to your actions or let you profit from what you've already done.&#10;&#10;You can also use some of the buildings to create glassworks, and those glassworks come into play on the VP cards, through tourist sales, and via an action space shown at the bottom of the game board image that lets you sell different types of glass for money.&#10;&#10;"

Aaron Burr. Unlike Washington, Jefferson, Madison or Hamilton, Aaron Burr came from American royalty &mdash; a founding father descended from the original puritanical stock that arrived in Plymouth. His father was the second president of Princeton. His grandfather was Jonathan Edwards, the philosopher-theologian who wrote &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,&quot; perhaps the most important American literary work of its time.&#10;&#10;So in 1776, if you were going to identify any of the Founders who would later stand trial for treason to his country, Aaron Burr would be the least likely &mdash; yet Burr's journey as an enormous talent born under a dark star is now well known. Less well understood is that when he shot Alexander Hamilton in the early morning hours of July 11, 1804, it would set in motion a chain of events much more bizarre than anything depicted on Broadway.&#10;&#10;Aaron Burr never stood trial for killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel. His trial was for treason, three years later, at the insistence of the Thomas Jefferson, the man Burr had narrowly lost to in the contested election of 1800. An embittered and politically ruined Burr seemed to have developed a scheme to separate the new Louisiana Purchase territories from the United States and declare himself king over the new entity. When Jefferson learned of the plot, he ordered Burr's arrest and publicly declared him guilty of treason.&#10;&#10;United States v. Aaron Burr: The Treason Trial of America's Third Vice President, a card-driven game for two players, recreates the treason trial of Aaron Burr in Richmond in 1807. But by accident of recent judicial reforms, Thomas Jefferson's detested cousin, Chief Justice John Marshall, would be riding circuit and would preside over the case. The resulting legal contest would read like a list of who's who of America's Founding Fathers.&#10;&#10;United States vs. Aaron Burr is a fast-playing card-driven game in which players seek to use events, evidence, and witnesses of Burr's activities to convince a jury to return a guilty verdict &mdash; or if playing for the defense, persuade at least one juror to find Aaron Burr not guilty. Each round, players have the opportunity to question witnesses, persuade jurors, and make points of law to the Chief Justice which will aid them in their cause. The game highlights all the events and participants surrounding one of the most important trials in American Constitutional Law &mdash; setting the precedent that the President of the United States is NOT immune from legal court orders, a precedent very much cited by the Supreme Court today.&#10;&#10;So try your hand as a great litigator in a great trial. Perhaps you will even find yourself smiling more and talking less!&#10;&#10;"
