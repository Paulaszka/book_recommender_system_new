It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square board. The recommended board sizes are between 5x5 and 9x9. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A group is a stone along with all other like-colored stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stones of its color. The size of a group is the number of stones in it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty square and move all stones adjacent to it one square directly away from it.&#10;&#10;If a stone is moved to an occupied square, the stone that was originally on that square is moved one square in the same direction as the stone that landed on it, and so on.&#10;&#10;If a stone lands outside the board, said stone is moved to the farthest square in the opposite direction, next to the edge of the board. If this square is already occupied, the stone on that square is moved one square directly toward your newly placed stone, and so on.&#10;&#10;If two stones are moved to the same previously empty square, the one of those two stones that moved toward or past your newly placed stone is returned to its original square. If this square contains another stone that was moved on the same turn, said stone is also returned to its original square, and so on.&#10;&#10;Your newly placed stone cannot be moved. Any stone landing on it is returned to its original square, along with all other stones that were moved in the same or the opposite direction as that stone.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the board is full. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. If the board is empty, whoever added the last stone to the board loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsSquared: A player's score is the sum of the squares of the sizes of their groups. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Komi is used instead of the pie rule. Komi is the even number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Collect Flocks of Sheep, keep them safe from Attacks, and use Action cards to destroy anyone that gets in your way!&#10;&#10;Players take turns drawing cards to collect matching sets of disguised Sheep and a variety of powerful Action cards. When a player has collected 3 Sheep of a kind, they must be placed face up on the table immediately. This set of 3 Sheep is called a Flock. In a 4 player game, the first person to collect 4 unique Flocks is the winner.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player may use as many Action cards as they like by playing them to the Discard. They may also make one trade with the Field per turn. The Field is a constantly changing group of cards in the middle of the table that players can exchange cards with to help them build a strong hand. The Field guarantees that the game isn&rsquo;t completely luck of the draw and allows the player to strategize and build combo moves in order to progress their game.&#10;&#10;Players can also target an opponent's Flock by placing an Expose card on top of it. This Action exposes the Flock's disguise, leaving them vulnerable to an Attack! Players must choose to take the risk of leaving their Flock exposed or pay to remove the Expose card, ensuring the Flock's identity remains a secret. When an Attack card is drawn, all Exposed Flocks are destroyed!&#10;&#10;Be strategic and be devious. If you play your cards right, you can turn the Attack card into an extremely powerful tool to help you get ahead... otherwise, you may end up as the victim.&#10;&#10;If you find yourself falling behind, don't worry! All players are in it until the very end and one big move is all it takes to flip the whole game on its head!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
