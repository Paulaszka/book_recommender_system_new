Now they take turns distributing their finds to the four treasure spaces, but the growing stacks make the dwarves more and more nervous. Should they secure their share now and make a run for it? Some dwarves are greedy and hang back, and by doing so they might miss the right moment to leave, with another player stealing their favorite treasure from right under their nose. And if the worse comes to the worst, the cave orc will catch them!&#10;&#10;Before leaving the cave in Mein Schatz (&quot;My Treasure&quot;), you need to decide on a treasure stack and a treasure type, so it's important to remember where the right treasures are. It's hard to keep track, but that stack in the top right corner contains quite a lot of pearl necklaces, right? And then you try to pick a good moment to leave. Usually it pays to wait as the treasure cache will only grow in the course of the game. But keep an eye on your fellow dwarves, and watch out for that cave orc!&#10;&#10;"

A bus is different than a train, even if they are the same playing piece. So they can't be blocked and always have a &quot;green wave&quot;.

There, with the ability to command the vast energies available, biokind waged war  with itself for control of the Multiverse.&#10;&#10;Diatomica is a 2 player &quot;batteline&quot; style game lasting about 30 minutes. Players place cards on their side of the Multiverse Orders to gain attack strength. When the Threshold Value is reached the control for that Order is decided. The player who controls the most Orders at game end is the winner.&#10;&#10;Basic Game - Each player receives one set of the 6 different Ship cards (Organelle, Vault Complex, Cluster Hive, Plastid, Centriole, Shift). The remaining 6 Ship cards are then shuffled and 3 are dealt to each player. Each player now has 9 cards in their Ship deck. Each player should shuffle their Ship deck and set it to one side.&#10;&#10;Advanced Game - Shuffle the 18 Ship cards, creating a Drafting deck. Each player draws 3 cards to their hand. 1 card is chosen to be added to the player&rsquo;s Ship deck, and is placed in front of them, face down. 1 card is then passed to the opposing player.&#10;&#10;Of the remaining 2 cards in hand, 1 card is again added to each player&rsquo;s Ship deck. The final card in each player&rsquo;s hand is placed on the bottom of the Drafting deck. Repeat drawing hands of 3 cards and drafting choices until all 18 cards have been drawn. During the final draw each player will receive one card to be added to their Ship deck of 9 cards. Each player should shuffle their Ship deck and set it to one side.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the remaining 30 cards and create a Draw deck. Each player, beginning with the Start Player (who is chosen at random), draws 3 cards from the Draw deck to their hand as well as 3 cards from their Ship deck.&#10;&#10;Lastly place the 40 markers within reach of both players. These wil be used during the game to show the amount of energy a player has to draw from as well as Attack Strength modifiers.&#10;&#10;Play: &#10;Beginning with the Start Player, each player&rsquo;s turn consists of &#10;3 phases. Player&rsquo;s are free to consider any phase optional but phases go in order:&#10;&#10;1. Playing a card: The player may play a card from their hand beneath any of the 6 Multiverse Orders not yet controlled, stacking the cards vertically in a column.&#10;&#10;2. Activating a Special Ability: The player may now activate the Special Ability of any one card they have previously played to any Multiverse Order.&#10;&#10;3. Drawing/Discarding a card: The player now draws back to a hand limit of 6 cards from either their Ship deck and/or from the Draw deck.&#10;&#10;Control Phase:&#10;Once the die&rsquo;s value on a Multiverse Order card falls below zero, the die is removed and normal phases of a player&rsquo;s turn are halted.&#10;&#10;The player who played a card to reach or pass the Threshold Value is now the Attacking Player. They add up all Attack Strengths of their cards in that Multiverse Order&rsquo;s column, including any Attack markers and any additional Ship bonuses. The Attacking Player then announces their total Attack Strength.&#10;&#10;The opposing player, now the Defending Player, may:&#10;&#10;A. Play a Ship card from their hand spending Energy markers equal to the Threshold value of the Ship card to only the Multiverse Order currently under the Control Phase&#10;&#10;or&#10;&#10;B. Activate the Special Ability of one card played to their side of any of the Multiverse Order cards, spending Energy markers as required.&#10;&#10;Game End:&#10;When control over the final Multiverse Order is decided, the player who has the most Control Value points is the winner. (Note: Game end should also be triggered if one player has won more than half the total Control Value points.) If players are tied, the player who has the greatest number of Energy markers is the winner. If still tied, the player who has control over the Multiverse Order of Icosa is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Kontact Now: Red Eclipse (KNRE) covers the Cold War Gone HOT in West Germany in 1989. KNRE is designed and developed by Steve Overton with Jon Southard, designer of the original Fire Team game consulting and graphic design by Shayne Logan.&#10;&#10;KNRE covers the US and Soviet forces fight on geomorphic maps that are represented at 50-meter hexes and 2 - 5-minute turns.&#10;&#10;KNRE brings together mechanics to represent the OODA Loop, training and experience of military organizations, Command and Control of tactical combat units, random impulses based on the capabilities of your leaders on the map, intuitive game play based on the units responding to game play as soldiers do in actual situations, and the ability to create random events such as happen in small unit actions.&#10;&#10;Couple the OODA Loop with the training and experience of each nations organizations in the series to create a unique blend of Command and Control with organizational traits. Tactical Event Cards add additional options for play, Command Points give you a varying number of orders per impulse - determined by the quality and condition of the leaders you currently have in play on the map. As the overall leader in the game, you can do whatever you want. You just won't be able to do it all at the same time. If one of your Command Point chits is drawn, you will have between 1 and three orders to issue. Those orders range from firing at the enemy to repairing support weapons and everything in between. That's all great but which orders do you give 'RIGHT NOW'? Each of us has a different idea about what's the most important thing to do at any given moment.&#10;&#10;Leaders play the pivotal role in the game by creating orders, directing fire, providing a movement bonus, and assisting in rallying of broken/disrupted units. The state of your leaders on the map determines how many orders they can give each impulse during the turn. The organization of the nationality you have determines the number of orders you may get in an impulse. The player who can utilize his leaders to the greatest effect will usually be the winner. Usually, because nothing is ever 100% certain in the KN game series.&#10;&#10;Weaponry has not been left out of the game. All weapons of the era are in the game. All weapons systems in the series have been created using the same formulas. This allows each unit - weapons system - to be created with it's own unique values in relation to the other weapons of that same weapons class over the past 70+ years and into the future. Armor penetration values are constant throughout the series as are armor defensive values; for all vehicles and helicopters. Each weapons class has been exhaustively researched to give you the best unit values to work with. You don't have to worry about the weapons and the systems. All you have to worry about is using them in a winning combination.&#10;&#10;KNRE will include Off-Map Artillery, night rules, multi-level buildings, rubble, fires, roadblocks, helicopter, Close Air Support (CAS), Antitank Guided Missiles, Surface to Air Missiles, Man Portable Air Defense systems.&#10;&#10;KNRE will include both high and low counter density scenarios; with a variety of complexity. From basic infantry only all the way to helicopter supported combined arms battles.&#10;&#10;Asymmetrical Victory Conditions combined with the Tactical Event Cards and concealment counters, random CAS attack packages, random size artillery missions, and Opportunity Fire adds a heavy layer of Fog of War to the system.&#10;&#10;Because of the random chit draw for each impulse during a turn, the series is extremely solitaire friendly.&#10;&#10;KN very much adheres to the chaos gaming method. This is not an &quot;I take a turn/ You take a turn&quot; game. This is random events, varying length impulses per turn, surprises at every moment kind of a game with an intuitive set of rules. It is not so random that you have nothing to do but sit back and let the game play itself. The choices are there every impulse for the gamer to impact game play. Tactical Event Cards can be played at any time, no matter whose impulse it is. Game play gets so intense that the gaming table may crack!!&#10;&#10;Good Hunting.&#10;&#10;"

The Emperor himself tasked the bravest and most resourceful nobles to claim the island in his name with the promise of eternal power and glory.&#10;&#10;To win the game you have to develop your faction according to several different aspects: military power, territory, knowledge, fame and influence over the imperial court. To fulfil this objective players have to explore the island and exploit its resources to support the growth of their settlement and armies. The resources are found on tiles that are randomly spread across the game board.&#10;Turn by turn you have the opportunity to make wondrous scientific discoveries or exploit the natural magic of the island to unlock new structures for your settlement or units for your army. Exceptionally gifted individuals, heroes, will become your field agents, discovering the deepest and darkest secrets of this island.&#10;Conflicts over territory or resources are common between factions and, far from imperial supervision, what really matters is the end not the means to reach it. The island itself, however, reacts to human presence, trying to reestablish order by cleansing the land from all living beings.&#10;&#10;What pathway will you choose to become the Emperor&rsquo;s favorite? Force, wealth, fame or knowledge?&#10;&#10;Will you cultivate science or rediscover lost magic?&#10;&#10;All this and much more is Nadaras!&#10;&#10;"
