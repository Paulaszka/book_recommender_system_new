Over almost eight centuries, these two cultures went through periods of war and peace, intolerance and coexistence, and the fragile alliances between ones and others kingdoms changed overnight depending on the political interests of each sovereign. (Christians against Muslims, Christians against Christians, Muslims against Muslims), with the Jews as an economic force that exerted as a hinge. Likewise, foreign powers such as the Papacy or the Caliphate also played their cards in the peninsular contest. In &quot;Rex Ib&eacute;ricus&quot; you will have to take control of one of the main six Iberian medieval kingdoms: three Christians (Kingdom of Castile, Kingdom of Aragon and Kingdom of Navarra) and three Muslims (Emirate of Cordoba, Emirate of Granada and Emirate of Valencia). Through political intrigue, diplomacy and war, as well as economic and cultural development, you will have to fight to make your kingdom or emirate become the most powerful on the Peninsula, and be named &quot;Rex Ib&eacute;ricus&quot;.&#10;&#10;For this, you will have the opportunity to occupy villages, castles and walled cities, and then build farms, palaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, libraries, towers and lighthouses, which will magnify your kingdom. Likewise, you must recruit armies and build fleets to defend yourself from your dangerous neighbors, and in no case will you do well to neglect the basic nutritional needs of your subjects, since you could face brutal peasant revolts of unpredictable consequences. You must also ensure the defense of your coasts, since the fearsome Viking warriors could land on them and destroy all the wealth of your prosperous State. To help you with these challenges, you will have four historical leaders from each kingdom (Isabella, Ferdinand, Urraca, Abd al-Rahman, Boabdil, Zobeyda ...), each of them provided with special skills depending on the position assigned to them (King, advisor, ambassador, emir, vizier ...), and you can also use them to seal alliances with other kingdoms through marital links, which will make you join forces to protect yourself from more belligerent third parties, while allowing you to engender heirs (princes and princesses) to ensure the survival of your legacy.&#10;&#10;In the same way, using your political influence and the support of your allies in the assembly, you will have the opportunity to reach the cusp of the Iberian Court (common to all peninsular kingdoms), which will allow you to control powerful elite units. Nor should you underestimate the power of the conspiracy, which will allow you to carry out espionage missions, instigate internal revolts and even kill rival monarchs. Finally, you can embark on exciting sea voyages to the East (Rome, Baghdad, Jerusalem and China) in search of external support to implement your political structures and deal with your enemies, although long journeys will never be without danger. Are you prepared to travel to the Middle Ages and enter an exciting world of castles, swords, religious conflicts and palace plots?&#10;&#10;"

The objective of the game is to bond as many Atomo cards as you can on your turn, in order to win.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Place the Octomic Ring in the center of the table. &#10;Shuffle the full deck of Atomo Cards.&#10;Deal each player their Hand (9 minus # of players). &#10;All player hands remain face up in front of them as &lsquo;in play&rsquo;.&#10;Place the remaining cards face down on the center of the Octomic Ring as the Atomo Deck. &#10;Player with the highest Valectron count in their hand starts, then counterclockwise.&#10;&#10;GAME OVER&#10;The game ends when there are no more Summoned Atomo left on the Octomic Ring to play. When this happens, everyone discards the rest of their hand so only point deck cards remain. &#10;&#10;    Long game option: When the Octomic Ring runs out of Atomo cards, reshuffle the discard pile as a new set. Repeat until there are no more summoned Atomo, or no more bonds can be made by any player.&#10;&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;The objective, is for each player to Bond as many cards as possible, so that you get to claim them for your Point Deck. &#10;3pts/per Atomo card in your point deck.&#10;1pt/per Valectron on each of those Atomo cards in point deck.&#10;1pt/per Bond made with your point deck during end game scoring.&#10;&#10;ROUNDS&#10;The Active Player starts their turn by flipping the top card of the Atomo Deck over to reveal it as the Summoned Atomo for that round.&#10;&#10;The Active Player then decides, based on all the cards in front of each player, themselves included, which cards to bond with the Active Atomo. The more cards bonded, the more of them you get to keep &amp; add to your point deck at the end of that round, but also stay aware of how many Valectron points that card has as well.&#10;&#10;    Point Deck cards are not &lsquo;in-play&rsquo; to bond to. &#10;&#10;&#10;As the active player searches for bond combos, the other players should be verifying the bonds being attempted, as well as suggesting bonds that will help themselves as well as the AP. In this way, the game is both co-op as well as competitive.&#10;&#10;At the end of each players turn, they should draw enough cards from the Atomo Deck to refill their hand.&#10;&#10;Four modes teach you the game by starting simple, then adding mechanics which you can mix and match as you like:&#10;&#10;Beginner: Basic Octets.&#10;Casual: Phases to cool &amp; heat Atomo&rsquo;.&#10;EleMagi: Radioactive Isotopes add stabilization complication.&#10;EleMaster: Use correct bond types to ionize Atomo&rsquo; for more bonding options on your turn.&#10;&#10;BEGINNER MODE&#10;&quot;Octets&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Ignore all other modifiers&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Valectron&rdquo; is EleMaster slang for &ldquo;Valence Electron&rdquo;.&#10;For this mode, you just want to create a total of 8 (an Octet) Valectrons around the Summoned Atomo.&#10;&#10;To bond a card to the Summoned Atomo, place a hand card from yourself or another player onto a BondBloom (the glowing mineral leaves on the edge of the Octomic Ring). You can bond up to four cards.&#10;&#10;For a successful bond, the total of Valectrons around the Summoned Atomo, plus the Valectrons around each bonded Atomo must equal a total of 8. No more, no less.&#10;&#10;If you bond, place all the bonded cards into your point deck. If you can&rsquo;t make a bond, discard the Summoned Atomo, return all hand cards to their owners, then end the round and let the next player start their turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;    In this Beginner mode, if the Summoned Atomo drawn has eight already, you simply add it to your point pile as an automatic point and that ends your turn. This does not apply in the other game modes.&#10;&#10;&#10;CASUAL MODE&#10;&quot;Phases&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Use Phase modifier&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s where we harness some of the core concepts of chemical bonding through the &lsquo;EleMagic&rsquo; of the Octomic Ring.&#10;&#10;Each Atomo has it&rsquo;s own default &lsquo;phase&rsquo; on it which refers to the Heat Energy it contains at standard Earth temperatures, which determines the &lsquo;state&rsquo; it&rsquo;s in.&#10;&#10;For example, &ldquo;H2O&rdquo; with low heat energy makes it a Solid we call Ice. Add more heat energy and it &lsquo;melts&rsquo; into the Liquid we call Water. Add even more heat energy, bringing it to a boil and this begins to break it down into the Gas we know as Steam or Vapor.&#10;&#10;The higher the heat energy, the more likely it is to lose valectrons, and thus its bond.&#10;&#10;Adding an Atomo&rsquo;s phase to its matching color on the ring, has no effect. However, if you add an Atomo to a color with more Heat Energy it loses -1 Valectron per phase increase. Likewise, you can add +1 Valectron for each phase downward you go as well.&#10;&#10;This starts to give you more flexibility in working with the available cards in play.&#10;&#10;ELEMAGI MODE&#10;&quot;Radioactivity&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Use Phase modifiers.&#10;&bull; Radioactive Atoms must be stabilized.&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t see the decaying skull, it&rsquo;s not a radioactive Atomo, and you can ignore this. However, if an Atomo card does have the Decaying Skull on it, this means it is radioactive and must be stabilized in order to use it.&#10;&#10;If the summoned Atomo is radioactive, ALL bonds must be made through the plasmagic (yellow) blooms which makes it a stable isotope.&#10;&#10;If you fail to create a bond with a radioactive summon on your turn, you must not only discard the Summoned Atomo but also one card from you point deck. &#10;&#10;     If you have no cards yet in your point deck, you must discard one from your hand after refilling.&#10;&#10;&#10;ELEMASTER MODE&#10;&quot;Metal &amp; Bond Types&quot;&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&bull; Form an Octet of Valectrons&#10;&bull; Use Phase and Radioactive modifiers.&#10;&bull; Use the correct Bond Types (below).&#10;&#10;Metal Types:&#10;Each Atomo has one of three Metal Types on it. These determine which cards can bond with the Summoned Atomo, based on the BondBloom you use.&#10;&#10;Bond Types:&#10;Each of the BondBlooms is able to perform one of three main Bond Types. You must use the correct pairing of Atomo, or the Bond will not work.&#10;&#10;If the bond does work though, it adds or subtracts a set number of Valectrons from the bonding Atomo (no partials):&#10;Ionic:         +/-  1 Valectron&#10;Covalent:      +/-  2 Valectrons&#10;Metallic:      +/-  3 Valectrons&#10;&#10;WORLD&#10;EleMasters begins in the world of the Fractal Forest, where science and sorcery collide. Through the Octomic Ring, you can communicate with Atomo', the spirits of Atoms and particles. In learning to wield that ring, you as an EleMage can teach the Atomo' how to alter and bond elements of the periodic table. Train with your fellow EleMagi and then together take this expertise with you to save the world.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The board was designed with seven players in mind, but more or fewer can be accommodated easily.  The spaceships used are severely limited in range and must frequently be serviced in order to remain operational.  Consequently base location dominates considerations of strategy.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;&#10;Orion Cluster was designed for long-duration postal play (play-by-mail) and uses a referee to execute planned player turns; it derives several concepts from Diplomacy.&#10;&#10;The game board is made up of a hex grid measuring 17 hexes across and 18 hexes down, references by a letter/number system.  In play, the grid is toroidal (movement off one edge enters the opposite edge)  Forty-two hexes are identified as containing numbered stellar systems.&#10;&#10;Turns comprise one half year of operations and primarily are focused on moving units on the grid and spending economic points, which accumulate based on how many star systems are controlled.  Units include Fleet, Coloniser, Fort, Transmitter, and Base types.  Movement is considered simultaneous; turns which end with opposing units in the same hex are resolved by combat with results primarily determined by superior unit numbers (some randomization is used in certain situations).&#10;&#10;Alliances between players may be formed and violated at each players' discretion.  A player wins the game by controlling 60% of the entire economic value of the game at the end of any turn.&#10;&#10;Orion Cluster was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 54 - Jun 1979).&#10;&#10;"

Both players record the location of their forces on a square grid (such as graph paper), using paper and pencil.  The explorer player searches the area by moving and calling out the position of his men, and by using magic spells.&#10;&#10;The guardian, with limited ability to move, attempts to kill the searchers or at least prevent them for as long as possible from finding the treasure.  When an exploring hero or wizard occupies the same square as a guardian monster, a die is rolled to determine which is killed.&#10;&#10;Turns alternate until the treasure is captured or, rarely, all explorers are dead.  Usually two games will be played at the same time, with players alternating roles, and the winner of the match will be the first player to succeed in his explorer role.&#10;&#10;Including set-up time, one play lasts no more than half an hour.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;&#10;The board is a simple 10 x 10 grid with rows enumerated by letters A - J and columns enumerated with numbers 1 - 10.  The board is not actually used as a play surface, and each player may maintain their own annotated grid.  Turns are played simultaneously, with each player secretly noting moves and then openly executing them in a determined order of precedence.  Most &quot;units&quot; move and occasionally engage in conflict with opposing units - however, wizard units may cast a variety of spells that perform specific, unique functions.  A few of the guardian units also have special abilities.&#10;&#10;The explorer player wins by finding the treasure and moving a unit to it; the guardian player wins by destroying the explorer's units.  If two simultaneous games are played, the player who first finds and reaches the opponent's treasure wins both games.&#10;&#10;The game includes a few optional rules that complicate play but allow for more unit flexibility.  A method also is presented that allows for play without dice by combining random numbers selected by each player - this method also is suitable for postal play (play-by-mail).&#10;&#10;Fantastic Quest was written by Lewis Pulsipher and published in Chimaera (Issue 73 - Mar 1981).&#10;&#10;"
