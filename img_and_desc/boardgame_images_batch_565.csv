There you and your fellow lab workers have been tasked with studying a parasitic alien organism found frozen deep in the Arctic ice.  To everyone's horror, the specimen turns up missing and anyone could be the infectious Creature's host!  As a Human, try to reveal the Creature's identity before it infects everyone and escapes the quarantine.&#10;&#10;GOAL The Humans, represented by the Immune, must identify and eliminate the Creature before the Creature and his Infected outnumber them.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY The game is meant to be played over a weeks time, or roughly one day for every one person playing the game.&#10;&#10;On the first day each person is dealt an Identity card from the deck, two of which must be the Creature and the Immune.  The person who draws the Immune must immediately reveal their Identity to the group, whereas everyone else keeps their Identity a secret.&#10;&#10;Once the Identities have been established, and the Immune has revealed themselves to the group, the game officially begins.  At this point everyone is free to go about their business.  Now the Creature begins his mission.  Once a day, including the first, the Creature may approach one of the other players, shake their hand, and state &quot;You have been Infected&quot; to convert them to the Creature's side.  The Creature may only do this once per day, but doing so will increase their numbers, and ultimately bring the Infected closer to victory.&#10;&#10;On each day following the first, the group will get back together for a few moments to discuss what has happened since they last met.  After everyone has had an opportunity to speak, they will collectively vote on who they think the Creature is.  The person with the most votes against them must reveal their Identity and are eliminated from the game.  The Creature and any of his Infected are still part of the voting process, because as far as anyone else knows they are Human.&#10;&#10;The Humans win if the can eliminate the Creature during the vote. If the Immune is eliminated however, the Creature and his Infected are victorious.&#10;&#10;FINAL The Creature should be played with at least 8 people, and playing with more people is almost always a better experience.  The game includes other unique Identities, in addition to the Immune and Creature, that may be added to the game for more fun and chaos.&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to reach the top of the Crag, retrieve the Scroll, and then make it off the Crag again. The game board is defined as a series 49 four inch squares arranged in four tiers. The top tier is the peak of Star Snag Crag.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a team, or Quad, made up of 4 different specialists, selected from the 8 possible types listed in the game. Some types focus on mobility, others on combat, and some, like the Beastmastr [sic], level the playing field with unusual abilities. These character types also rely on items (magical &amp; non-magical) to give them an edge in certain situations.&#10;&#10;Each turn the players perform game actions in a set order of phases: Activation, Movement, Exploration and Occurrences (weather effects or wandering monsters), Conflict Resolution, and Evening (a time of healing and recharging). Both players act simultaneously so occasionally members of one Quad will end up in conflict with each other quite by accident. Random game elements can also send creatures or primitives to attack members of a Quad. Terrain effects are randomly determined the first time the member of a Quad enters a new square. These effects can produce anything from a Refreshing Spring to a Dragon Nest.&#10;&#10;Unlike most miniatures game, death isn't a feature of Piptwynn's Scroll. When one side wins a conflict, the other side is driven away. Since this is fundamentally a race to the peak of Star Snag Crag, getting pushed back on any given turn can make the difference between winning and losing. In this way the game is more family-friendly than the many miniatures games that focus on death and dismemberment.&#10;&#10;The rulebook also contains several rules variants, including set up a larger board for tournament play. Also included are reproducible sheets, charts, tokens, etc., along with tips on how to paint miniatures and how to build a proper three-dimensional game board. (Players must provide their own miniatures, a playing surface--which can be simple map or more traditional war game terrain, and a set of polyhedral dice)&#10;&#10;There were several planned follow-up games for this title, including an RPG crossover. None of them seem to have ever come to fruition.&#10;&#10;"

Can you outsmart your opponents and assemble a four-wheeler robot with two heads, or a robot with six eyes and four hands before they do?&#10;&#10;In Robots on the Line, robot parts move down two conveyor belts. Players take turns pulling robot parts (heads, bases, arms, hands, batteries, antennas and magnets). Not all robot parts can be taken, however. The line you're pulling from must be switched to ON. Robot parts that aren't taken will be discarded onto the junk pile. Players can pay a dollar to go through the junk pile or they can pay a dollar to turn ON/OFF switches. As players take robot parts, they build robots in front of them. Players can build up to four robots in a game. Trading is always allowed.&#10;&#10;To finish a robot it must have a torso, a head, and a base with all other segments off the torso ended with the other parts. While you're building, you'll want to look to the buyers to meet their requirements. A requirement might be a robot with four eyes, or a robot that has no wheels, or a robot with three hands. If you meet a buyer's requirement, you sell it for money. If you meet the bonuses, like medical, war, or cleaning, you get even more money. The game ends when all tiles are off the line or when a player has built 3 robots. The player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;"

If a player is the first to land on one of the numbered spaces, he draws the card from the deck of 30 cards and reads out the information on the blue side of the card. Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.&#10;&#10;When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished. The others play on. When all the players have reached the 30 space, the 'won' cards are added up and the winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;"

Your army including axe-men, spearmen, swordsmen, archers, an engineer, horsemen and 1 king, all with different and balanced attributes. The fighting/attacking mechanism is an elegant 1 to 3 custom dice rolling system. Each player has the exact same army, similar to Chess, as to see which player really has superior strategic skills. Asymmetrical games can also be played with endless scenarios.&#10;&#10;Each player has an &quot;Army Map&quot; sheet for his army which illustrates and keeps track of each warrior and warhorse. Each man in your army has his own health meter, skills, attributes, and even a place for the player to name them. This gives an unparalleled  up-close-and-personal view from the battlefield. Engineers are a big part of the game, they can cut down trees, construct archer towers to enhance their attack range, walls, fire trenches and even make extra arrows for your archers.

Although infantry play an important role, they are not the primary focus of the game. A typical game will consist of one to five armored vehicles and, three to seven squads of infantry or support units.&#10;&#10;The game is designed to play like a WWII simulation. Every effort was taken to use and distill actual WWII vehicle and combat data in the creation of the vehicle stats and game play. Unlike modern warfare, not every shot will hit its target and many hits will not penetrate your opponent&rsquo;s armor and result in an instant kill. Two evenly matched vehicles may find themselves in an extended engagement, trading shot for shot until one finds a soft spot and makes the kill.&#10;&#10;The decision to base the play style and game mechanics on a more antiquated technology was a conscious one, born from the desire to add more depth to the combat than a simple &ldquo;Roll D6, four or better, you kill your target&rdquo;. Vehicles, regardless of the manufacturer represent more of a financial investment than infantry units do. With this in mind, the number of large units required to play Iron-Core have been reduced as the vehicle and infantry survivability has been extended to a more descriptive and cinematic feel.&#10;&#10;Our goal is to provide a game system that rewards tactics and punishes suicide runs.

Many of optional rules may slow play but highly recommended.&#10;&#10;There are many game systems available, each have their own strengths, weaknesses and focus. If you are looking for a brigade level combat game, Iron-Core may not be the best choice. If you want a dynamic vehicle vs. vehicle combat system where having the biggest and the best does not equate to an &ldquo;I win&rdquo; button, then Iron-Core may be the game for you.&#10;&#10;"

This game is in the genre of Iron Road / TransAmerica and SNCF / Paris Connection.&#10;&#10;Players start the game with one large investment cube and three small investment cubes in hand. The game board shows the United States from Minnesota to Washington; game play starts in Minneapolis/St. Paul. On a turn, a player either places one of their cubes in a city (other than Seattle) that hasn't yet been reached by the train or builds track. If they build track, they choose one of the railroad lines exiting the city where the train is currently located and place a locomotive on it to show the current endpoint of the railroad line. Track has directional arrows on it, and a new train line can never move against the arrows or back to a city that the railroad has already visited.&#10;&#10;When the railroad visits a city where players have placed investment cubes, they retrieve those cubes and take additional cubes from the supply: one new cube if they had a small cube in the city and two new cubes if they had a large cube.&#10;&#10;When the railroad reaches Seattle, the round ends. Players tally the number of cubes in hand and records this number on the &quot;good investments&quot; track; they record the number of their cubes still on the game board on the &quot;bad investments&quot; track. They then reset the board as at the start of the game, then begin a new round. After three rounds, whoever has made the most good investments wins; if players are tied, then the tied player who has made the fewest bad investments wins.&#10;&#10;You can play a single round of the game to determine a winner, if desired, or you can play new rounds with no recorded score, with a player winning the game if they win two rounds.&#10;&#10;Note that the Winsome version of Northern Pacific is for 3-6 players, whereas the Rio Grande Games version is for 2-6 players.&#10;&#10;"

Each conflict is decided using victory points, that are awarded by breaking a stand-still between two sides of trenched foes.&#10;&#10;Each conflict represents a battle to hold 5 different objectives. To win the objectives, each player drafts a hand of 6 cards that will be played by turn (face down) on a chosen objective, until all players pass or finish their hand.&#10;&#10;Then the players reveal the cards and start activating the special actions, in ascending order. Each side tallies the objectives they have obtained to determine if they broke the tie and won the conflict!&#10;&#10;The game features a unique intense experience of drafting, deploying, deceiving and triumph!&#10;&#10;"

Introducing the Republic Defense Force, Loyalty and Vigilance can be played on its own, against the Corps from The Corporate Wars, or mix-and-match the cards to build your own customized deck!&#10;&#10;Each player has his or her own deck of cards consisting of a Station, ships, modules, Marines, technological breakthroughs, events, and tactics. Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.&#10;&#10;Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).&#10;&#10;The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;Second Edition Updated Rules&#10;&#10;Stackable Traits are no more! &#10;To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled. Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.&#10;&#10;Trait-or-Fire!&#10;Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.&#10;&#10;Spicing Up Events!&#10;The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.&#10;&#10;Faction-Only Cards!&#10;Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).&#10;&#10;Module Overhaul!&#10;There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).&#10;&#10;Say Goodbye to Characters!&#10;Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.&#10;&#10;First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!&#10;We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.&#10;&#10;New Combat Mechanics!&#10;&#10;Initiative in Engagements&#10;Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.&#10;&#10;Attacker and Defender&#10;Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot. So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.&#10;&#10;New Skirmish Phase&#10;The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish. Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only. No more extra turns for defenders!&#10;&#10;Boarding Actions&#10;Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order. You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.&#10;&#10;"

You control a squad of Marines advancing up the beach towards enemy machine gun positions.  Rolling the soldiers on your dice allows them to advance, but you might also roll machine gun fire which slows them down.  Each suppressing fire result pins down one of your soldier dice and if you accumulate three suppressing fires in a single turn, your entire squad is pinned down and none of your soldiers advance!  If you&rsquo;re lucky, you can use smoke grenades to avoid the fire and push your squad up the beach.  Your goal is to assault the bunker, but you also need to outpace your opponent&rsquo;s soldiers!  At the end of the game, you score bonus points if you moved your different soldiers farther than your opponents, so you need to pay attention to what they are doing!&#10;&#10;"
