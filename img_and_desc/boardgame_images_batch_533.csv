In this regard it is like Chutes and Ladders. The theme is riding your pony from start to the finish line.&#10;&#10;There is a twist on the Chutes and Ladders type game. There are two card decks from which a player may get a move card on his turn. However the player must flip a supplied &quot;coin&quot;  to see if he gets a card from the Johnny stack or the pony stack. having each player flip a coin would thus make &quot;individual&quot; luck come into play as opposed to both players just playing against a randomized deck.&#10;&#10;The game had 4 riders and horses. It cam in a cardboard box that was somewhat like a pizza box.&#10;&#10;

Each turn, players draw tiles indicating where they can take actions, such as attacking or reinforcing. After all the players have taken their turns, the regime takes 3 automated actions in random sectors. Each battle can be fought with military power, or with popularity.&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player (or the regime) reaches a target score, based on popularity and sectors controlled. At that point, the force with the highest score wins, and if the regime is highest, all the players lose. In the standard rules, players can directly attack each other or temporarily align with the regime. There is a fully-cooperative variant, where players face a stronger regime.&#10;&#10;"

The war of the gods has begun... Born from the dreams and nightmares of mankind, mythic beings are gathering forces to crush their enemies. They have put their fate in the hands of mere mortals like yourself, granting you the power to lead them to victory. Capture your opponents&rsquo; forces, turn their powers against them, and forge your own legend!&#10;&#10;In Immortal, ancient gods, heroes, and monsters battle for control over mythic realms. 2 to 4 players assume command of powerful pantheons summoned from world mythologies - Master Set One features the Norse, Greek, Japanese, Celtic, Egyptian, and Native American pantheons. Each pantheon of character cards offers unique abilities and strategies to be mastered. Battles take place on a battlefield created from modular board tiles, representing the nexus of mythical realms. The goal of the game is to control the most cards on the battlefield by capturing your opponents&rsquo; cards and defending your own.&#10;&#10;During the game, players take turns placing their character cards on the spaces of the board. Each card has a distinct combination of battle strengths, represented by numbers on its four edges. When a card is placed on a space adjacent to the north, south, east, or west edge of an opponent&rsquo;s card, an attack begins and the strengths on the cards&rsquo; touching edges are compared. If the attacker&rsquo;s strength is greater, then the defending card is successfully captured, giving the attacking player more control over the battlefield. Special abilities can influence the results of an attack, and set the board up for future combos by strengthening allies, weakening enemies, and bending the normal rules of the game.&#10;&#10;After the first battle, players upgrade their pantheon decks with more powerful cards, and expand the battlefield with additional modular boards. Victory goes to the player who controls the most cards at the end of two battles. Game variants allow players to form teams, change the rules of engagement, or play faster matches. Once players have mastered the basic strategies of the game, they can mix and match characters from different pantheons to build their own custom decks. As Immortal evolves, more pantheons will be added from the myths and legends of distinct cultures. These expansions will introduce new boards and cards, and new abilities and playing styles to the game.&#10;&#10;"
