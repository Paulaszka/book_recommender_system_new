Micromachines make excellent and inexpensive miniatures in roughly 1/3700 scale.&#10;&#10;Game Overview:&#10;&#10;Players control 1-5 space ships and plot simultaneous turns. Movement is 2-D cinematic flight with basic momentum incorporated into the the movement mechanic. Games end when one side reaches its break point or accomplished its scenario objectives.&#10;&#10;Combat is based on variable numbers of d6s (depending on weapon and range). When ships reach damage thresholds, players draw a card from a damage deck and apply the results (usually bad, sometimes good).&#10;&#10;Full stats for Federation and Klingon ships as well as ship status displays are available in the magazine and on the Battlegames website: http://www.battlegames.co.uk/dispatches/dispatches_fanscifi.html .&#10;&#10;"

So are all of your opponents.&#10;&#10;The daily life of the hermits is represented by tricks of cards, and there will typically be more than one trick in play at a time. The goal is to avoid taking tricks with personality cards in them. Tricks that don't have personalities in them don't matter one way or the other.&#10;&#10;The above description is from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.&#10;&#10;Hermit is a game akin to Hearts where players are attempting to avoid taking cards that are worth points. Rather than a single suit being avoided, Hermit requires that you do not win tricks which contain &quot;personality&quot; cards, one of the three sub-types of cards in the Decktet, which represent a person following you home and thus ruining your perfect life of solitude.&#10;&#10;Regardless of the number of players, tricks are played open to the table. On a player's turn they must add a card from their hand to a trick with the requirement that the card being played shares at least one suit with the last played card on that trick. If they cannot meet that requirement they must use a card to start a new trick. If the card they play is the highest rank in the trick the entire trick moves in front of them. Thus any new tricks always start in front of the player opening them.&#10;&#10;When a fourth card is added to a trick it is &quot;closed&quot; and the cards are captured by whomever the trick is in front of. If on a player's turn there are no available tricks, including the first turn of the game, each player simultaneously starts a new trick and that player then takes their turn, in effect allowing them to play two cards in a row. When the last player places their last card any unclosed tricks are discarded and each personality card taken counts its rank for scoring with Crowns being rank 10.&#10;&#10;When one player reaches a predetermined score, typically 66 or 100, or a certain number of deals are completed the game is over and the player with the fewest points is the loneliest and thus the winner.&#10;&#10;Special rules exist regarding Aces and Crowns as well as a Shoot the Moons/Suns variant, a &quot;House Party&quot; variant, and rules for 2-player Hermit games which incorporates a &quot;Cottage&quot; and laying off throughout the game.&#10;&#10;"

Yet goblins are oblivious to symbolism. For them, it is just a matter of economics.&#10;&#10;This Decktet game, inspired by Christina Rossetti's poem of the same name, is a series of auctions in which players buy cards on the goblins' terms: They'll give you coins for nothing, until you've won some auctions --- but later, your only way to get more coins will be from your fellow players.&#10;&#10;This description is adapted from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.&#10;&#10;Rules: Decktet Wiki&#10;&#10;"

It has turned into much more than that. It has so many distinct features to it, the only recognizable part that remains are the counters. Caesar's Legions was a captivating game and pretty successful for Avalon Hill. It broke the mold of their traditional WWII games and the traditional combat chart that they used. There were two short comings with the game - there were only five scenarios, and there was no campaign game.&#10;&#10;Caesar in Gaul covers a much shorter time period, which makes a campaign game more adaptable. At present it has nine historical scenarios. The rules are more complex as is the combat system, but it remains an intermediate level game, and is highly suited for solitaire play.

Any leftover cards are discarded, along with the matching clock cards.  The remaining clock cards are spread out face down on the table.&#10;&#10;3. Each player chooses a mouse counter and places it in the 'start' area of the playing board.&#10;&#10;4. The first player begins by turning over one of the clock cards on the table.  They read aloud the time and look to see if it matchs the time on one of their activity cards.  If a match is made, they move the clock hands on the playing board to the correct time, move their mouse forward one space and keep the clock card.&#10;&#10;5. If the time on the clock card does not match any of the player's activity cards, the clock card is returned to the table, face down, and play moves onto the next player.&#10;&#10;6. If the clock card shows 'one o'clock', each player must move their mouse back one space on the clock board.  All players also return one of their clock cards to the table.  The matching activity card is then back in play.&#10;&#10;7.  Play continues until one player has matched all their cards and has reached the top of the clock playing board.&#10;&#10;Winning the game&#10;The first player to have match all their activity cards with the clock cards and reached the last space at the top of the clock playing board is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulsed-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.&#10;&#10;In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood includes seven operations. &quot;Balkan Brawl&quot; takes place in Macedonia, &quot;Schneiders at Juvincourt&quot; pits French tanks against German infantry, &quot;The Lost Battalion&quot; and &quot;Go to Hell!&quot; depict the battles of the 308th US Infantry Battalion in the Charlevaux Valley, &quot;War of Machines&quot; and &quot;Combined Arms&quot; involves British and German tanks on the Western Front, and &quot;Kaiserschlacht&quot; depicts trench fighting between the British and Germans during the last German offensive of the First World War.&#10;&#10;Included in In the Trenches: Through Mud and Blood are five 11.5&quot; x 8&quot; maps, 264 die-cut counters, one rulebook, guides for all seven operations, one reference card, and two D6s.&#10;&#10;(source: Grenier Games website)&#10;&#10;&#10;Maps:&#10;&#10;Maps are single-sheet 11.5&quot; x 8&quot; and printed on stiff, glossy cardstock.&#10;&#10;The featured five maps are:&#10;&quot;Hill 06&quot; covers a piece of territory near Lake Doiran in Macedonia&#10;&quot;Juvincourt&quot; features the village of that name, and the nearby countryside &#10;&quot;Charlevaux Valley&quot; contains the battlefield of the Lost Battalion, &#10;&quot;Open Ground&quot; leaves a clean playing field for the tanks (and perfect for make-your-own battles),&#10;&quot;Racecourse Redoubt&quot; features a network of trenches on the Western Front.&#10;&#10;Scenarios:&#10;&#10;Balkan Brawl&#10;To break the stalemate at Salonika, the Allies planned to strike the Bulgarian centre. As part of a larger effort, the 11th Worcestershire Battalion, 78th Brigade, 22nd Division aimed to capture &quot;06&quot;, a strongpoint of the Bulgarian 9th Division on &quot;Pip Ridge&quot; just east of Lake Doiran in Macedonia. At 2145, after days of intermittent shelling, the preparatory barrage ceased and the officers' shrill whistles rose from the din. British troops filtered down into Hana Ravine just before bounding up the slope to &quot;06&quot;.&#10;&#10;Schneiders at Juvincourt&#10;As part of the Nivelle Offensive, Commandant Louis Bossut led five &quot;Special Artillery&quot; groups of 16 Schneider tanks each into German lines near Berry-Au-Bac at 0600. Groupment Bossut crossed the first German trench line with infantry against light resistance. But nagging artillery fires and mechanical failures began to nibble away at his force. Four kilometers later, Bossut swung northward to cross the second German trench line with his 60 remaining tanks and the 151st Infantry Regiment. After crossing around 0900, Bossut split his force sending two groups north toward Juvincourt, two more west toward Mauchamp and one south toward the Aisne.&#10;&#10;The Lost Battalion&#10;On 2 October 1918, elements of the U.S. 77th &quot;Liberty&quot; Division from New York attacked north into the Argonne Forest. Major Whittlesey's force of two battalions from the 308th Infantry and two platoons of the 306th Machine Gun outpaced neighboring American units by penetrating a full kilometer into German lines. At dusk, Whittlesey's men dug in along the north slope of a valley between a road at the top and a stream at the bottom. Company K of the 307th joined the following morning. Seeing that this force had outpaced its flank protection, the Germans slowly encircled the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot;, in a pocket about 500 meters east of Moulin de Charlevaux. At 3 PM on October 3, the Germans launched their first attack.&#10;&#10;Go to Hell!&#10;After 5 days of siege, the Lost Battalion was out of bandages, drinking from the Charlevaux Brook, and coughing on the stench of the rotting corpses that surrounded them. the Germans sent an American POW back to his comrades with a letter offering to accept an American surrender. According to legend, Major Whittlesey spat back, &quot;Go to Hell!&quot;&#10;&#10;Kaiserschlacht&#10;The Kaiser's Battle began at 0435 with an unprecedented artillery bombardment of gas, smoke and high explosive rounds. About 9,955 tubes of all sizes rained over 1,100,000 shells across 40 miles of frontage. At 0940 the firing stopped; Stosstruppen immediately sprang from their shell holes as German regulars emerged from trenches close behind. Near Grugies not far from St. Quentin, Germany's 238th division slammed into Britain's 36th Ulster amid dense fog and lingering smoke. The recently arrived Ulster men had just taken over French positions and had yet to fully implement the new defense in depth doctrine.&#10;&#10;War of Machines&#10;During the Second Battle of Cambrai, British troops of Byng's third Army broke through the Hindenburg Line to &quot;the green fields beyond.&quot; Leading the way, tanks of the 12th Battalion helped XVII Corps capture Niergnies. Just east of the town, Captain Roe's tank, L16, paused at Mont Neuve Farm. there he spotted four MIVs coming his way from the east. C Company - he thought.&#10;&#10;Combined Arms&#10;After Ludendorff's Operation Georgette bogged down in the north, he made a thrust for Amiens. At dawn on April 24th, thirteen German tanks lumbered forward over a gloomy moonscape with infantry close behind. After plowing through Britain's 173rd Brigade, they covered 4,000 yards to reach the Cachy Switch Line, a stitch work arrangement of incomplete trenches between Villers Bretonneux and Cachy. At about that time, Captain Brown led three Mark IVs to the Cachy Switch Line with orders to hold at all costs.&#10;&#10;(source: user's description)&#10;&#10;"
