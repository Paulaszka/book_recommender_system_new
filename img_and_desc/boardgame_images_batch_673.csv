The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach the Finish space.  Dice are rolled to allow a player to first move their pawn, and second to move walls.  The walls pivot around a point allowing the player to open new paths to the Finish, or to block opponents' paths to the Finish.&#10;&#10;There are some special moves that a player may do when the player rolls doubles:&#10;1.  Change places with another player's pawn&#10;2.  Move through walls the number rolled (Double 4's means 4 spaces through walls)&#10;&#10;    Note:  If option 1 or 2 is played, then the player forfeits their option to move walls.&#10;&#10;&#10;3.

They will build roads and cities and send their heroes to battle - every opponent will have to find the most powerful mixture of all these assets and apply them at the right moment, so eventually the player could claim to be the rightful ruler of Battalia and win the game. A victory can be obtained through aggressive conquest or a peaceful development of your own city system (if a player is lucky enough and the others let him ... :). Battalia has 2 game end conditions - full conclusion of the game board or first player, who achieves 5 cities of level four, immediately ends the game.

You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.&#10;The game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.&#10;&#10;The calendar mechanics is implemented in the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game.

Most of the cards in the game (units, artefacts and terrain cards) and the 8 figures belong to one of the four factions. A leading concept in the game is that the four factions can freely collaborate with each other, but many units from the same faction, using their own artefacts, are much stronger together. Also, unlike all other games where the players choose their factions, in this game the factions choose the players...&#10;&#10;"

Eventually the Wombatonians launched their attack on the One Wombat to save themselves. In the end, the Wombatonians created six weapons called the Wombat Stones. When they used the weapons, the One Wombat split into many pieces, although its consciousness survived. The Wombat Stones became lost in six different pieces of the One Wombat. Eventually, these pieces became the planets we now know as Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Neptune, and Earth. As time went on life began to grow inside them.&#10;&#10;Every One Hundred Wombatonian Years a tournament is held, Wombat Combat. The evil Combat Croc has won the tournament for the past nine centuries--except suffered failure in the last Wombat Combat Tournament to the warrior known as West Wombat. Combat Croc ordered the Crocodan horde to attack the Island known as Australia on Earth. The horde raided and injured most of West Wombat's fellow warriors, including his Wombat Masters. This enraged West enough to re-enlist in this centuries tournament. He was not alone. Marauder Maus, Kaolin, and Major Waylin Bear, who was in search of his missing subordinate, Elizabeth Emu, were also following right behind West Wombat seeking revenge, and to compete in the next Wombat Combat tournament at the same time. But unbeknownst to West Wombat and the warriors, the tournament was a ruse, a diversionary trap set by the Combat Croc in an attempt to break the rules set forth by the Wombatonians, and in rescuing Elizabeth, Combat Croc's scheme was thwarted and the Combatants prevailed.&#10;&#10;In retaliation Combat Croc has scheduled an unsanctioned tournament on Earth. He seeks revenge and to claim all Wombat Stones so that he may take the place that the One Wombat once held.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt one Wombatant and a Wombat Stone. Both of these cards will be laid face-up on the table in front of the player who holds them. Each Wombatant has a certain amount of hit points they can absorb before they are defeated. As attack cards are laid in front of Wombatants, the points will be deducted from the hit point total until they are expended. The object of the game is to use your Wombatant to take the Wombat stones from all the other Wombatants in the game.&#10;&#10;Each player will be dealt five cards from the Combat deck. On their turn, a player has the option to play an Attack card against any opposing player, or to lay a Counter card against the Attacks already played against them. After playing an Attack or a Counter, the player draws another card from the Combat deck. When a player's hit points are consumed, their player is out, and the last Wombatant to Attack them takes their Wombat Stone.

Players let characters fight, and the winner is the first player to cause direct damage on their opponent five times.&#10;&#10;The game uses artwork by the designer but also free artwork from an open source video game, &#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#188; (Jewel Savior).

In the pursuit of avoidance, each dexterously stacked banana peel represents a small victory. That candy wrapper hidden in the deep recesses of your room is a silent success. But the greenish milk carton you secretly stashed under your roommate's bed, that was a stroke of genius! That is, until you get caught making a mess while everyone else pretends they would never be so childish &mdash; as to get caught. Be careful and be cunning because only the champion can gloat in a hammock while everyone else lugs out the trash on garbage day.&#10;&#10;In Garbage Day, players take turns stacking garbage cards one at a time onto the overflowing garbage can, or stashing garbage cards in their rooms. But once a player's room gets too full, they must clean it by stacking all the cards from that room on top of the garbage can, very carefully, one by one. If garbage cards fall off the garbage can during your turn, place them in your overflow pile. If your overflow pile gets too big, you're eliminated from the game. If all other players have been eliminated, you win!&#10;&#10;"

When the crew wants to do something in the game, they combine the letters of an Action, Mission, and Location to form a code such as B-3-D4, and look up that paragraph in the book. After reading the paragraph's story and game instructions, you'll advance your adventure one step, and have new options to choose from. Your journeys are recorded in a booklet called the Passport, which holds items, chapter data, and is effectively the &quot;save file&quot; for the game.&#10;&#10;1001 Odysseys comes with 4 full story books, spanning approximately 400 pages.

Citizents are scrambling for the admission in hopes of free booze. With wise and smart decisions you need to help them to achieve their goals and at the same time impede on other players as much as you can. Each citizen has unique capabilities supporting their admission but your decisions and tactics can make them succeed in this entertaining card game.&#10;&#10;Setup: At the beginning sort all the cards by color. Each players chooses a certain color. The optional characters (negative numbers) can be used or can be excluded from the deck at your will. For the first few playthroughs, until you get familiar with the characters and game mechanics, it&rsquo;s best to play without the optional characters. Each player shuffles all of their cards, deal out 4 cards for their hands and placing the rest face down in front of them. Place the Entrance card on the table and in clockwise order the players begin to put their cards one-by-one next to the Entrance card.&#10; Gameplay: (each step is mandatory)&#10;&#10;    Place a card&#10;    Execute the action for character of the placed card&#10;    Execute starred characters&rsquo; actions in the queue from back to front. In every turn each character executes their action once, hence if a starred card is placed during the turn then its action won&rsquo;t be executed again.&#10;    Draw a card if you have less than 4 cards in hand.&#10;    If there are at least 5 cards in the queue then the first 2 cards enters the Saloon. At the end of the game (even if Thief is in the queue) when all of the cards are played out the first card of the last queue enters the Saloon and the others go to the Cemetery. Cards are collected facing down.&#10;    If the color of the last card of the queue doesn&rsquo;t match the color of one of the cards which enters the Saloon then the last card walks sadly to the Cemetery. Optional rule: The player whose character walked to the cemetery is allowed (but not compulsorily) to draw one card from one of their opponent&rsquo;s hand if this opponent holds at least 4 cards in their hand. The player puts the drawn card facing up in front of the opponent. The opponent must play out this drawn card in their next turn. Card can not be drawn from opponent who already has a drawn card in front of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;Ending: Game ends when all of the cards are played out. The player who has the most characters in the Saloon wins. If several players end up with a tie then the player whose characters in the saloon have the lowest overall values wins.&#10;&#10;"

Four to six players engage in head-to-head (-to-head-to-head) constant combat until the frenzy peaks and one player emerges victorious.&#10;&#10;Set in an alternate 1920s, an eclectic collection of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest fighters are pitted against each other by the magnanimous Baron Reginald Fistcuffington Smythe aboard his monolithic floating airship. Baron Smythe, inventor of the new super-element Hydrolium, offers the winner of his &quot;Fisticuffs Bouts&quot; the granting of a single wish, whatever their heart desires most. The surviving fighter will get their wish fulfilled - and become champion of Fisticuffs!&#10;&#10;Gameplay is simple. Each player picks a fighter from our cast of characters, each with their own backstory and special move. The stable of fighters include a sky pirate, a flapper, a saxo-magician, the son of a slain Chicago mayor, and a robot built by Baron Smythe himself. Every player gives their fiercest battle cry, and whoever&rsquo;s is best begins the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with five cards from the Punch Card deck. These Punches will be a fighter&rsquo;s offense and defense. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they throw a Punch against any opponent - but that player can Block if they are holding a Punch of the same name. This leaves the attacking player open for a Counter, allowing the defending player to attack with a Punch that is the same color as their Block.&#10;&#10;Combat continues until a Punch goes un-Blocked or a Block goes un-Countered. When an attack successfully lands, the defending player loses health. Everybody starts at 12, and when they reach 0, they&rsquo;re knocked out for the rest of the match. Every remaining player gets a turn each round.&#10;&#10;Once a full round (one turn for everybody) has been completed, the fighters return to their corner. This is when you draw new Punch Cards - and when you get a Round Card, a special action that will help provide a tactical advantage by giving you more attacks, depleting an opponent&rsquo;s defenses, or giving you the edge you need in the middle of combat. The new round begins to the left of the person who started the last round.&#10;&#10;The rounds keep going until there are two boxers left, at which point they enter Close Combat - no more rounds, no more Round Cards, just two boxers fighting over one dream. The fighter that is left standing is the winner of the bout and the champion of Fisticuffs!&#10;&#10;"
