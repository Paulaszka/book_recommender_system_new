Stated to be a traditional folk game with rules handed down in the family, when marketed online, but it appears not to have been previously recorded.&#10;&#10;Played on a square wooden board, divided into 7&times;7 undifferentiated squares (the game can also be played on an 8&times;8 chess board).&#10;&#10;One player takes 6 light / natural coloured discs, termed ravens, and sets them up in one corner of the board, one in the very corner, another in each of the adjacent squares, and the remaining three in the squares adjacent to those.  The opponent takes six dark / stained discs, and similarly sets them up in the opposite corner.  Each player's specially marked disc, termed Odin's Raven, is placed at the head of this flock.  Players then take turns in moving one of their ravens, with the aim of winning the game by capturing all of the opposing ravens.&#10;Odin's raven moves like a knight in chess, and captures by landing on an opposing disc. Other ravens move like chess rooks, and capture by flanking an opposing disc, as in hnefatafl.  Odin's raven may also participate in these flanking captures.&#10;There are several slight variants with differing movement / capturing rules.&#10;&#10;"

There are also joker cards that can be used, where only the color has to be correct.&#10;&#10;When you want to use sun worshipping Lemurs, you need to make sure you actually have them.

One of which is the addition of transporting lumber&mdash;a huge export from the region&mdash;that can't be carried by E-trains, but by engineering the right 7-train route you can add a significant amount of revenue to your bottom line.&#10;&#10;Finally, one big departure from the '22 family is that 1822PNW does away with concessions and instead features a merger mechanic that more closely mirrors the way in which the major companies staked their claim in the PNW.&#10;&#10;All of the features combine for a refreshing and exciting take on the genre-defining 1822 series.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
