Each player has a royal piece (either Arthur Dent or Zaphod Beeblebrox), a Life, a Universe, an Everything, a Ford Prefect, a Wowbagger, and six Marvins. Properties of these pieces extend beyond movement -- for example, the Life can transmit powers between adjacent pieces. All moves except for the first consist of moving two different pieces. The goal is capture, rather than checkmate, of the enemy royal piece. Complete rules are here.&#10;&#10;Life, the Universe, and Everything has been programmed for Zillions of Games.&#10;&#10;"

Players are secretly assigned roles: either &quot;Werewolves&quot;, who know each other; or &quot;Villagers&quot;, who know only that there are Werewolves amongst them. During the night phase of the game, the Werewolves choose an innocent to kill. During the day phase, all players debate and speculate the identities of the Werewolves and vote to kill someone whom the majority suspects. Players are eliminated until either all Werewolves are killed or the Werewolves outnumber the Villagers.&#10;&#10;Werewolf In Town is partially derived from the original game called &quot;Mafia&quot; which was later given a Werewolf theme, and is being presented on The Game Crafter for the first time with all new, original 8-Bit style artwork and brand new rule variants for you and your group to enjoy. Also included on the cards is something missing from most productions of this game: explanations of the roles. No more running to the rulebook when you get a role you haven't had before or having to expose the fact that you have a unique role because you don't know how it works!&#10;&#10;Also included are some Blank Cards for you to experiment with your own new roles to liven up the game play after you have mastered what is in the box!&#10;&#10;"

Each player commands one of the armies in an attempt to conquer his foes in an ultimate bid to best the opposing player's generals.&#10;&#10;Units are represented by square tiles, which list the unit's combat strength in each direction, as well as any special abilities the unit may possess. Players attempt to place their tiles in key positions to bolster their own defenses while trying to maximize their position against their opponents tiles.&#10;&#10;Each player receives a number of action points to spend on his turn. These action points allow the player to perform such actions as playing new tiles, initiating combat, activating special tile abilities, etc.&#10;&#10;Combat between tiles always results in at least one tile being removed from the board. When this occurs, other tiles &quot;march&quot; in to fill the gap, potentially moving tiles closer or farther away from their targets.&#10;&#10;The victor is the last player with a general in play.&#10;&#10;"

Only this player's ducks may be shot at in this round.&#10;b) Bird flu: kills all ducks on the pond at once.&#10;c) Frank-ent-stein (pun in German: Ente = duck): kill three adjacent ducks and bring one of your killed ducks back into play (built from the mortal remains of the former???)&#10;d) Featherbrain: played on another player with a duck in the crosshairs. If that player has a fire card, he has to shoot his own duck.&#10;e) Shot in the dark: Kills the topmost duck on the draw deck.&#10;f) etc.&#10;&#10;- There are three duckling cards shuffled together with the other ducks and the water cards. While one of them crosses the pond, no shooting is allowed (no violence in front of minors). Then, the duckling leaves the game.&#10;&#10;- The German version now also has a gameboard and cardboard crosshairs (just like the old American version)&#10;&#10;- The colors of the 6 duck families are completely new, so the game should be combinable with the old game for an up-to 12-player experience (not tested, nor recommended by the publisher)&#10;&#10;"
