People move from floor to floor in a fascinating elevator that contains open compartments, moving in an endless chain. They enter one of the compartments while moving up and down, and then get off on another floor. Your job as a hotel detective is to follow the trail of all the mysterious characters using the elevator. Both the compartments and the characters are in constant motion, so you must use memory and logic to locate them all.&#10;&#10;Object of the game: the 9 cards are placed face down on the table in two rows, in order to represent the elevator.

[...] When the wretched people had no more to give, they plundered and burnt all the villages [...] the land was ruined by such doings; and men said openly that Christ and His saints slept. -The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle &#10;&#10;In 1120 a fateful shipwreck drowned William &AElig;theling, heir to the throne of England. Over fifteen years, King Henry laid the groundwork for his daughter Matilda&rsquo;s succession. But when the king died in 1135, his nephew Stephen raced to London and seized the crown. Four more years have passed: Stephen has consolidated power while Matilda has built an invasion force in Normandy and fomented rebellion in the southwest. The stage is set for a decade of valiant deeds and dramatic betrayals, a prolonged and capricious struggle for the rule of England.&#10;&#10;In The Anarchy two players revisit the 12th century civil war that plagued the Kingdom of England through a chess motif that models shifting loyalties and strategic circumstances. Players represent the sides of Stephen and Matilda, each supported by a set of knights and bishops. Pawns (English levies and foreign mercenaries) are recruited to raid and battle, and castles pop up all over the map, presenting opportunities to protect key strongholds or tempting an opponent as worthy siege targets. As the years wear on, and leaders are called to court, deployed to fight, and defect through capture or simple exhaustion, each side must strive to meet its own unique objectives to secure their claim to the throne of England.&#10;&#10;"

The goal in this medium weight, competitive game is to gain the most points by climbing the best route up the mountain and becoming the most skilled climber! Each player assumes the role of a unique asymmetric character, and throughout the game they will be building their route up the mountain, managing resources, achieving objectives, and increasing their efficiency by accumulating skills and gear! This game is for 2-5 players and takes 45-90 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Gameplay overview: &#10;In First Ascent, the goal is to gain the most points by creating the best route! Points are gained in four ways: &#10;1) Climbing pitches &mdash; use your climbing skills, gear, water, and psych to pay the requirements to move on to a tile &quot;climb the pitch&quot;. Draw a climbing card and resolve the events that may involve resource management, board manipulation, or selfish vs altruistic decisions. Each tile is worth 1-5 points with higher point value tiles requiring more resources.&#10;&#10;2) Objectives &mdash; achieve shared and personal objectives that relate to the path of your route. Plan carefully and manage resources to execute the path that will contribute towards achieving your objectives.&#10;&#10;3) Technique bonuses &mdash; the climbing skills and gear cards contain symbols representing climbing techniques of precision, power, balance, and pain tolerance. Match three technique symbols on the cards you play to climb a tile and earn +2 bonus points. These can add up significantly, so choose your resources wisely.&#10;&#10;4) Summit &mdash; reaching the top of the mountain is great, but climbing is about the journey. Gain +1 summit bonus point for reaching a peak.&#10;&#10;If you don't have the required resources to climb, you can &quot;risk it&quot; by rolling the risk dice to climb a tile for one less resource. You may get away with a check mark and succeed without consequence, roll minus two cards and give them to another player, or roll minus one card and one psych which you give to another player. As long as you have the assets to lose, you will climb the tile, but at a price.&#10;&#10;When you begin to ascend the mountain start in any tile on the first row. Next climb to any adjacent tile and leave your rope behind to mark the route you've climbed. Two climbers can not occupy the same tile, except for a summit, so you may compete with other climbers on the mountain for the prime locations.&#10;&#10;As you climb the mountain you will practice your skills and become a more efficient climber. The engine building component of this game grants you an &quot;earned asset&quot; after you play four cards of a specific skill type or gear. These tokens stay on your climber asset board and count towards fulfilling the required assets of future tiles.&#10;&#10;This isn't a race to the top, its about creating a strategic route that will reward your cunning and planning. The game ends when a player has used all seven rope lengths and climbed their eighth tile.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to create the greatest First Ascent?&#10;&#10;"

Manage your time and resources effectively, and gain as much experience behind the Potter's Wheel as you can before the master potter must pick their disciple.&#10;&#10;The Potter's Apprentice is a complex strategic Euro game centered around multi-use cards and a rondel-like board.&#10;&#10;The game plays for 3 rounds, each one a bit shorter than the previous. Each round players will take turns moving their apprentice around the Studio Board to visit various Locations for acquiring new Assignments, Clay,  and other resources - as well as the Potter&rsquo;s Wheel to throw (a ceramics term for shaping a clay vessel on a rotating wheel) their pottery and the Kiln to fire (the process of exposing ceramic pieces to high heat in order to convert them into durable finished pieces) their already-thrown pieces. Each turn the player may also be able to benefit from the bonus of a discarded Apprentice Card, and/or Special Abilities that are unlocked as players earn Experience throughout the game.&#10;&#10;As players move around the studio, they will drop Potter&rsquo;s Clay (of their unique player color) at various Batts (a term that refers to the circular plate on a Potter&rsquo;s Wheel, short for Batterboard) where each round an assortment of Scoring Tiles are placed. Scoring Tiles provide players individual goals for earning additional Victory Points at the end of the game. At the end of each round, which is triggered after all players have passed due to running out of Potter&rsquo;s Clay, players determine the winner of each Scoring Tile based on the player who left the most Potter&rsquo;s Clay next to it. The end of the first 2 rounds also awards some Victory Points for Vessels placed in the Kiln. At the end of the third round players proceed to the Final Scoring phase where they tally up all their Victory Points from personal Scoring Tiles they earned, Vessels they fired, the size of their Supply collection, their least-developed Experience Track, and Public Scoring Tiles. The player with the most Victory Points is declared the winning apprentice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

But beware! If that missing vowel matches the top vowel card on the deck, yell AIEOU (pronounced as AY-YO) instead! Player with the most cards wins.

In Speed Spells, players race to lay down correct vowel cards to spell out the word of a played card before grabbing any vowel piece for themselves. However, the last player to do this is left without a vowel piece to grab and is penalised with the card instead. Player with the least cards wins. Speed Spells combines picture-word recognition and spelling with fast physical reflexes in an exciting and fun manner.&#10;&#10;iii) Match&rsquo;em!&#10;What do you get when you combine the classic game of Snap with spelling? Out comes Match&rsquo;em! In this game, players try to identify matching vowels in played out cards. When a match occurs, players rush to grab a centre vowel piece. The player who manages this wins the pile of cards that have the matching sets of cards on top of them. Player with the most cards wins. Match&rsquo;em! stimulates players to quickly observe and analyse played out words.&#10;&#10;iv) Memory Buzz&#10;Can your mind stop buzzing around and focus on memorising? In Memory Buzz, players attempt to memorise not only the objects of the played cards, but also the number and sequence of each object. A player can be challenged by shouting out AIEOU if he or she is caught recalling objects wrongly. Player with the least cards wins.

In phase 1, you will populate your map with the units you want to send to Gaia; in phase 2, you will use your completed map to support the invasion.&#10;&#10;FILL IN YOUR MAP:&#10;In phase 1, Divination, you arrange Fae and Dragons, recruit aides (special assistants), and select the hallowed units who will seize the 6 hallowed citadels and secure the Shards of Gaia for Titania&rsquo;s crown. Take turns choosing which unit everyone will draw on their maps (map/player board), coordinating with other players to divine hallowed units, and recruit aides to earn rule-bending abilities. The phase succeeds when all six hallowed units have been divined. You fail if everyone passes before you complete this goal.&#10;&#10;USE YOUR MAP:&#10;In phase 2, Ascension, you open portals to Gaia (Earth) and send Titania&rsquo;s units into the field, using your hallowed units to seize the hallowed citadels. Take turns selecting missions to launch and shading in areas on your map that meet the mission requirements; meanwhile, the other players fill in similar areas on their maps.

They work to achieve various goals by constructing buildings within the town, adventuring throughout the region, navigating relationships with the mysterious sprites who inhabit the valley, and developing their character-specific professions.&#10;&#10;As an open-ended game, Mythwind has no distinct conclusion. Although many players may find a natural end point to their game at the conclusion of the story, players can continue to play the game for as long as they would like over as many game sessions as they wish. As players progress through the game, their town will develop and grow, reacting to changing seasons and to the members of the community over time. Progress made can be easily saved using the provided game trays, which offer a quick and easy solution for both tear-down of the current game and setup of future games.&#10;&#10;"
