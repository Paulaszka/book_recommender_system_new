With the aid of a powerful Telepath (Psi-Guardian) she sought out others of various talents to swell their ranks. She organized them in preparation for a war she foresaw hundreds of years into the future. The Psight competed with each other to gain strength and to teach the future generations to use their abilities. This competition became known as Psight, after the order itself.&#10;&#10;In Psight, each player takes on the role of a psychic within the order of Psight. The goal is to defeat your opponents using your various Powers, Memories, and Abilities. If you gain Dominance over a Domain, your road to victory may become easier, as your opponents will no longer be able to use any additional Powers, Memories, or Abilities from your Domain. However, plan your actions carefully, because one wrong move could easily spell defeat. With a well-planned strategy and a little luck, you can be the last psychic standing and claim victory!&#10;&#10;Psight is a strategy card game designed for 2-4 players. The objective is to out think your opponent and be the last player with cards in your hand. It plays similar to many CCG's without the expense of constantly buying booster packs or individual cards. We strongly disbelieve in the pay-to-win gaming model so everything you need to play with up to 3 other friends or family members is included in the game!&#10;&#10;Psight is also a color-blind gamer friendly game with the use of Domain names and symbols on every card in the game.&#10;&#10;"

The simulation includes 58 pages of rules and procedures, scenarios, counter sheets, and map sections.&#10;&#10;There are 16 scenarios beginning with an introductory basic scenario involving one China National Aviation Corporation DC-3 type aircraft flying a pioneering path-finding flight from Assam, India across the Himalayas to Kunming, China.  The second scenario brings in the US Army Air Force using C-47 type aircraft in flying fuel to China for Doolittle's Raiders that they would have used to fly from China to India after the Raid on Tokyo in early 1942.  Scenarios continue chronologically capturing highlights of the airlift campaign and introducing in succession:  C-87, C-46, C-109, and finally C-54 type aircraft.  The final scenario provides for as many as 500 aircraft in a one day maximum effort that occurred on August 1st, 1945 when the Air Transport Command India-China Division made over 1,000 sorties and delivered more than 5,000 tons of cargo to China in a single 24-hour period.  Scenarios provide historical average daily tonnage for comparison of player performance in running airlift operations.&#10;&#10;There are four counter sheets on 8-1/2 inch by 11-inch pages with each 1/2-inch by 1/2-inch counter representing a single aircraft with its flight characteristics printed on the counter.  There are eight map pages on 8-1/2 inch by 11-inch pages that can be trimmed to form a map approximately 16 inches by 40 inches with representations of geographic locations, terrain, and altitude bands for flying aircraft counters from India to China and returning for another load.  Various simulation tracks, such as the tonnage delivered, time clock, morale and efficiency, loss rate, and search and rescue level are included on the map sections.  The map also includes loading and turn around boxes at the air fields for tracking aircraft as they land, load or turn around, complete loading or turn-around, are cleared for takeoff, and take off on their next flight.&#10;&#10;The simulation is available as a free download and is fully contained in an Adobe Acrobat file that prints out on 58 pages of 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper.  The simulation includes some probability driven aspects of airlift operations, and three or more 10-sided dice can be used for these purposes.  No dice are provided, and players will need to provide dice or other means of generating random numbers.&#10;&#10;The simulation is designed for solitaire play.  More than one player can participate by dividing aircraft types among players or dividing operating bases among players.&#10;&#10;"

The aim of the game is supporting your clan with military advantage; the clan which has the most troops at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game each player gets a clan card which shows what clan the player will belong to and four troop cards from the deck. The area before the player (his table) presents one of Japan&rsquo;s provinces, so the more players the more provinces. The players take turns clockwise from the starting player. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of the following orders: the troop deployment order, the troop movement order and the attacking order. During his turn the player must place a card from his hand on any province except his own one. If by the end of his turn in his province he raised the army (some troops of the same clan) which is stronger (more numerous) than any other army in any other province, the battle is unavoidable. It will be impossible to stop the warlike samurais from attacking but there is an opportunity to direct them to the proper side.  Once there are no more cards in the deck players take a final turn and come in true colors (reveal their secret cards). Clan cards are summed up and the player with the most cards of his clan in all the provinces wins the game.&#10;&#10;What&rsquo;s feudal Japan without ninjas! Without them no game about Japan can be complete. The ninjas&rsquo; function is obvious &ndash; to shorten the number of warriors from the enemy clans.&#10;&#10;From 3 to 5 players can take part in the game. The tactics of the game changes depending on the number of players. You will need careful calculation to win in a five-player game; fans of bluff and &quot;psychological&quot; game will like the game with three participants. The game seems simple at first sight, but believe or not, keeping your clan in secret, guessing which clans your rivals play for and making them to play into your hands is not simple at all.&#10;&#10;"
