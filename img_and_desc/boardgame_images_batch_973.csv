There are no combat results tables. Combat and all checks are resolved using six-sided dice, in which results of 5-6 mark success, and 1-4 failure. Brigades activate via chit pull, with their constituent units moving and fighting individually. Stacking is limited to two units per hex.

The individual ground units represent battalions of approximately 700 soldiers (50-60 tanks in an armored battalion, 12-24 guns in an artillery battalion), or companies of about 200 soldiers (15-20 tanks or armored cars in an armored company, 4-12 guns in an artillery battery).

Can you mix and match the elixirs to create the most magical brew?&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;Group all of your Blinks together to create your bubbling cauldron. The game begins the moment you do!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;Each turn, rearrange your Blinks in an attempt to create matches. A &ldquo;match&rdquo; is 3 or more Blinks of the same color in a cluster. Matched Blinks get replaced by new colors. Sometimes, new colors will immediately create a match, and these matches will cascade one after the other if you position your Blinks correctly.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll notice as you make matches that your Blinks will begin bubbling - this shows how alchemically activated each Blink is. Each time a Blink is matched, it increases in alchemical power, which causes it to bubble more and more intensely. Eventually, after 10 matches, a Blink can become a Bomb.&#10;&#10;Bombs appear as spinning points of color. To activate a Bomb, click the Blink. This will cause an alchemical explosion, turning all adjacent Blinks to the color of the bomb, and automatically creating a huge matching cluster.&#10;&#10;But be careful - Bombs only last a few seconds before they revert back to their basic form. If you miss it, you&rsquo;ll have to power up that Blink again.&#10;&#10;If you are playing with 12 or fewer Blinks, it is possible to end up in a situation where no matches are possible.

First, place 12 Blinks in a 3 x 4 rhombus formation, with distinct rows and columns.&#10;&#10;During gameplay, instead of moving Blinks freely, you must instead break off rows or columns of the rhombus and re-attach them to the opposite end.

For example, the formation commander will not be deciding on which type of ammunition (HEAT, APDS etc) each tank will be firing when engaging an enemy unit, this would be left up to the tank&rsquo;s own crew. So many parts of the rules that may seem simple or &ldquo;glossed-over&rdquo; are simply below the player&rsquo;s (acting as overall commander) level of command.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play&#10;Various sequences and methods of unit activation were considered however it was decided to go back to the classic &ldquo;I go, you go&rdquo; sequence (albeit with interruptions form an opponent&rsquo;s units on overwatch).&#10;&#10;Morale&#10;Morale has been heavily simplified to a single dice roll at the end of each turn for any units that have come under fire and been suppressed. This determines if they fall back, continue fighting or give up, surrendering or leaving the battle area.&#10;&#10;Ground Scale&#10;The approximate ground scale of 1&rdquo; =100 metres was chosen as it would allow for realistic weapon ranges to be depicted on a reasonable sized table without being able to fire across the whole area, allowing more emphasis on manoeuvre and positioning of units.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

If you loose, you get more cards to get rid off. The winner is the first to exhaust his/her stock.&#10;With GeoXpert, learn all countries' flag, name, capital, and other facts and quiz your family and friends.&#10;GeoXpert may be played with 2, 3, 4 or more players. It may be played alone too.&#10;There is a card of each country. The verso has only the flag and the continent, the recto gives country's name (in English, French and the official languages of the country), capital, currency, area, population, flag and coat of arms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

A player can use one or both of their actions to flick one of their Blinks, generally with the goal of knocking enemy Blinks off the table, but sometimes to accomplish other strategic ends. Unless otherwise specified, a player cannot flick or activate the ability of the same Blink more than once in the same turn.&#10;&#10;Players can also choose to activate the power of one of their army Blinks as an action. Many roles have a power that can be activated with an action, but several have passive powers which do not require an action. All powers are detailed at the end of the rules. If, during play, a Blink connects to another Blink, you must separate the two by 1 inch and rotate them so that they are no longer aligned to each other. Some powers may affect this rule.&#10;&#10;If a Blink falls off the table or out of the bounds of the battlefield as the result of a flick, whether intentional or by accident, that Blink is dead - unless it&rsquo;s a Crown or affected by a special ability. Set your dead Blinks to the side, out of the battlefield&rsquo;s boundary but within reach of the players.&#10;&#10;WIN CONDITION&#10;The first player to lower their opponent&rsquo;s Crown to 0 health wins!&#10;&#10;To reset your army and start a new game - cluster your Blinks together and triple-click one of them to reset the cluster back to setup.&#10;&#10;VARIANT RULES&#10;Crownfall has multiple rule variations and alternative modes of play. For all variations and a more in-depth explanation of the rules, see the full instructions document online at blinks.games.&#10;&#10;"
