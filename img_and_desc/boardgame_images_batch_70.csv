7991,,"This games was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #114. Napoleon and the Archduke Charles: The Battle of Eckmuhl is a game for two players, simulating the battle of Eckmuhl which took place on April 21-22, 1809. One player commands the French forces, the other the Austrians. The map is an accurate representation of the battlefield, the counters represent the forces which took part, and rules on movement, combat, leadership and morale reflect the problems and possibilities which faced the historical commanders.&#10;&#10;The scale of the combat is that one strength point represent 200 infantry, 150 cavalry or 2 guns, each turn is 35 minutes; each hex is 600 yards. Victory is determined my control of objective hexes and loss inflicted on the enemy.&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;Eckmuhl is a complete game in itself. It can also be played as a &ldquo;campaign game&rdquo; linked with another of 3W&rsquo;s Bonaparte series, The Battle of Abensberg (in S&amp;T #113). Eckmuhl was fought on the two days following Abensberg, in the area immediately to the north. Many of the same units participated, along with many others. Two scenarios were provided with Abensberg; four are provided with Eckmuhl. A further dozen scenarios will be found in The Wargamer #3 and S&amp;T #115 (Kanev). These later scenarios link the two games.&#10;&#10;Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #116 adds two more scenarios and a Q&amp;A by the designer.&#10;&#10;"

7993,,Racing game on a modular Board. Every player holds cards from 1 to 9. Everyone chooses one card and they are revealed simultaneous. Highest card moves first. There are some spaces e.g. TURBO (win one position) with special features. These are the heart of the game. Moving in front of an opponent costs 1 additional movement point. &#10;The player with the most points from his 3 cars wins the race.&#10;&#10;

7995,,"Quits is a clever, fast-paced abstract strategy game of shifting paths and calculated choices. The goal? Be the first player to remove three of your marbles from the board. But getting there won&rsquo;t be so easy.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you must decide: move one of your marbles&mdash;or shift one of the movable board tiles, altering the path for everyone. The modular board constantly changes as players slide squares, opening new routes or sabotaging opponents.&#10;&#10;Perfect for 2 or 4 players (no 3-player option), Quits rewards tactical thinking, flexibility, and just a touch of deviousness. Victory requires you to stay on course&mdash;or cleverly knock others off theirs.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 1991 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169;.&#10;&#10;"

8045,,"Princes of the Renaissance is set in Renaissance Italy. Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d'Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain 'interests' in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A city's status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player's army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles.&#10;&#10;No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the 'right' side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore.&#10;&#10;"

A new dark pantheon of Gods watches over the earth and feeds upon the spoils of war; a banquet of souls slain on the wretched battlefields of Chronopia.&#10;&#10;Once you have chosen your army it will be time to select the troops that you will lead into battle.  Chronopia isn't a game that relies on the strengths of only one model, but rather the abilities of a diverse collection of warriors all working towards a common goal.  You will populate your army with warbands of close combat warriors, soldiers trained in all manner of weaponry from swords to axes; missile weapon warbands that will rain death down upon their enemies in great volleys; and Individuals like spell casters or fearsome monsters or even mighty war chariots.  Whatever the case, you will create a diverse army with which to recreate the epic struggles of the Empires of the Fourth Age of Chronopia.  You will populate your forces with miniatures and models available from Excelsior Entertainment.&#10;&#10;These models will represent your own style of waging war and will be selected for your tastes.  Once you have chosen your warriors you will need to paint them.  A well-painted army will bring your games to life and seize your imagination with the epic battles you will recreate.  There are many resources to help you learn how to paint your miniatures and we recommend that you practice and try new techniques- the results will well be worth it.&#10;&#10;You will need a few things to begin your epic journey into the realms of Chronopia.  Most important are this rule book, some Chronopia miniatures from the extensive Chronopia line, Warband Unit Cards (which come with each model), a twenty-sided die (d20), a ruler or measuring tape, and a pen.  In addition to these items you may need some of the counters and templates found in the back of this book.  You will also need a place to engage your armies in battle.  This can be an inspiring custom war game table that you have spent a great amount of time creating or it can be as simple as a dining room table or a stretch of floor.  The site of a well-designed table however, with your armies spread out before you will do wonders to fire the imaginations and invigorate your play.  There are numerous resources for how to create battlefields and just as many manufactured resources to draw upon.  Excelsior also makes a line of battlefield accessories that can be used in your game&#10;&#10;"

The Allies are gathered to attempt their breakout and begin the race toward the German frontier. Each player has Combat Units and Headquarters available, and is capable of maneuvering across the map and engaging enemy pieces in combat. You must master the deceptively concise rules for Activation and Movement Point expenditure. And at any given time, you will face the decision of which army to Activate in any one phase - and your opponent will have an immediate opportunity to react . The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality. There is a track display that you use during movement/combat. As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions. It's easier to play than it is to describe.  For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.  The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).
