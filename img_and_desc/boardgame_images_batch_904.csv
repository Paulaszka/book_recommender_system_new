When someone gives you provisions, it makes you more valuable to the group, which matters when the boat finally arrives to whisk your group to safety. But the provisions are tainted with vampire blood....&#10;&#10;On their turn, players send provisions to other players from a face-up deck. The cards are public but the undersides of the cards may have bites on them. Each provision has a low, medium, or high probability of being tainted with vampire blood. The players with the most valuable provisions are thus the most dangerous to the group. Subtle negotiation is required to get the most provisions onto the boat without bringing too many vampires.&#10;&#10;This semi-sequel to GROWL (2019) keeps the primary &quot;card giving&quot; mechanism but removes player elimination and the honor-system aspect. It also introduces a riveting finale.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

When preparation is over, the run begins.&#10;&#10;During each turn of the void run, players will flip over the next card in the 10-card void deck, and all must resolve that card (take damage if it's a creature, draw and resolve a dice roll event card, or gain victory points based on the card revealed).&#10;&#10;Once a void run card is resolved, all players who remain alive in the void must then choose whether to leave the void and bank their stored energy for the next run (they gain one per void run card successfully cleared) or to push their luck and prepare to resolve the next void card.&#10;&#10;Deciding when and how far to push your luck is doubly intense and gripping, because all players are armed with a small hand of unique ability cards each run. These cards have lots of powers, which range from preventing damage and skipping void events, to messing with other players and causing havoc for their opponents (or preventing opponents from messing with them).&#10;&#10;Abilities can be played at almost any time during the run. When multiple players fire abilities that would negate or impact another player's abilities, the abilities are resolved in instant reverse order (like instants in Magic: The Gathering).&#10;&#10;Any player who survives the entire 10-card run gains additional victory points and other perks.&#10;&#10;Players continue the Preparation -&gt; Void Run loop until someone reaches 10 victory points.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The game begins in the year 1130, when the old king Sigurd Jorsalfar dies. Each player begins the game as one of Sigurd's heirs or one of the other influential people in Norway at the time, who is vying for power in the vacuum left by the old king's death.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses through the 110 years of the conflict, players will use their heirs that are spread around the board to either strengthen their influence through marriage, or to continue the fight for control over Norway. By gaining glory in combat you can also attract famous warriors to your cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a modular, semi-abstract, three dimensional board with a typical Norwegian coastal landscape, with mountains, fjords and islands, without being a map of Norway. Since the board is modular, players can set up the board in a new way each time they play, giving them the possibility for endless variety.&#10;&#10;A player's turn in Fjordar typically goes like this:  You play a card with movement points and various abilities, and use the movement points to move your units and establish supplylines. If you have moved one or more of your units into an area with enemy soldiers, you and the other player resolve combat by each choosing a combat card in secret and reveal them simultaneously, with the combat cards adding extra strength to your units' base strength. What combat card is the most effective is highly dependent on each situation. &#10;You may then use your units to perform various actions at the different locations on the board. In forests you can build new ships, churches and villages. In villages you can muster troops and collect taxes, while in the castles you can marry away your heirs or bring them home to your own castle along your supplylines.&#10;&#10;Some of the effects on previously played movement cards and combat cards also carry over to your later turns, which means that through proper planning, and adding the right persons to your cause, you can build up to some very effective turns later in the game.&#10;&#10;Points are scored for building new stave churches, burning stave churches, founding new villages, igniting beacons and moving your heirs between castles. The game is over when a player has reached a certain number of points, whereupon there is a final score count where you may score extra points depending on how much glory you have gained in battle and what families you have connected to through marriage.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players will be able to choose to start the campaign from the Russian advance into Wallachia (modern day Romania) or at the start of the Crimean campaign.

Siege Artillery will play an important role being necessary to destroy fortresses before an assault. In addition to the operational battles,  A linked campaign will be included so players can carry their losses across multiple scenarios and compare their performance to their historical counterparts.

This Introduction Module allows players to affordably experiment with VSTS and allows players to re-fight one of military history, along with western civilization&rsquo;s most decisive moment, the battle of Marathon in 490 BC.&#10;&#10;Emperor Darius I of Persia resolved to crush Athens for aiding the Ionian revolt by sending ships and other means of support. Greece, through the development of the city state and democracy created the hoplite phalanx in which each man must hold their space in a tightly packed linear formation packed with over a thousand men with spear and/or shield. The Phalanx in formation became a heavily armed juggernaut that would continue up until the Roman development of Legion tactics.  The Persians on the other hand used completely opposite arms and tactics, relying on speed, delay and missile tactics to harass an enemy, leaving the heavy combat to their cavalry.&#10;&#10;Athenian democracy was tested as citizens debated what to do as Persians began to unload men, horses and supplies on the shores of Marathon. After 5 days of debate and noticing that the Persian cavalry was being reloaded onto ships for redeployment likely to ravage the rest of the Athenian suburbs, the Athenians decided to act offensively against the Persians while at a numerical disadvantage.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the battle, the Athenian center were pushed back but quickly rallied and outflanked the Persian forces before they could unload enough troops proficient at shock combat. Unable to delay and harass the Greeks by withdrawing and using ranged combat, they ended up getting totally slaughtered by the Greeks as they were completely ill-prepared for hand to hand combat with heavy infantry.  Driven back into the sea, the Athenians had achieved a major symbolic victory, managing to severely damage the Persian attempt at establishing a beachhead for a further invasion of Attica from Marathon. The Greek way of war had proven itself as superior to the Persian, which had been the dominant power in the region before this point in history, that all changed with Marathon.&#10;&#10;VSTS is inspired by the PRESTAGS set of games from SPI, GBOH from GMT, and Battle Hymn by Compass Games. Wings of each army are activated by chit pull; the combat phase is also initiated by a chit pull followed by an ongoing melee phase after all chits have been pulled. While ranged combat uses a traditional CRT type mechanic, melee combat has players rolling a handful of d10s in search of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; against their opponent. dividing the number of dice thrown between all enemy units in front hexes. The base chance for hits depends on the morale of the units involved as well as facing, terrain, the presence of leadership, and more. Units absorb Disruption Points and as they do so, become progressive susceptible to Routing, automatically routing once they reach a level of DP equal to their SP. Exclusive Rules for Marathon are focused on recreating the various speculative conditions academics have argued about in relation to Hoplite combat, Phalanxes drift to the right when mobile, Phalanxes advance at variable rates towards an enemy, Locking Shields as a tactic to create a more shock-resistant Phalanx, as well as loose-formation rules for Phalanxes which allow for limited stacking combined with more maneuverable units. Many of these exclusive rules, if not all, will be present in the first full game of the series considering 4 Battles from Lacedaemonian (Spartan) history.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;"

It's a deep, challenging experience all on its own, with extra depth and complexity for players who own both games!&#10;&#10;In the game, you play as a legendary character, battling opponents with weapon cards: arrows, swords, deception, sorcery, and even alchemy. The more you injure your opponents, the better you fare in the tournament. However, even the most injured characters can make a complete comeback with the grace of Godsend cards and the aid of their special companions. This trick-taking game ends when one opponent has been injured to the point of death. The player with the most health is then declared the tournament victor!&#10;&#10;In Tournament at Avalon, you also have cards representing the legendary enchantress Morgan Le Fay and a new set of location panels that grant additional advantages to a player when they are the host of a tournament round. If you have Tournament at Camelot, you can mix and match your favorite cards, playing with either ruleset or combining the two games to play an epic &quot;Chaos of Battle&quot; tournament with seven or eight players!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
