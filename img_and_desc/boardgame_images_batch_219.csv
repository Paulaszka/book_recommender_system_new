Using durable plastic tiles on a full color game board, players take turns laying tiles on a 7&times;7 grid and score points for adjacent tiles that create runs, sets and sums of 24 or 7.&#10;&#10;In 24/7: the Game, players score for combinations of tiles in four directions. While the importance of tile placement and strategy is key to winning, the element of luck magnifies as the combinations of tiles take shape in all four directions.&#10;&#10;Play a tile and score points or block your opponent from scoring. By playing the right balance between offensive and defensive placement, try to keep your opponents on their toes as you rack up points.&#10;&#10;24/7: the Game is a challenging game for two to four players, ages 8 and up.&#10;&#10;"

The box itself is the board and contains 1 die and 50 wooden pins.&#10;&#10;The wooden board can be folded into a box to contain the die and the pins.&#10;&#10;On top of the board there are 6 numbered borings. The pins fit in these borings. The boring with number 6 leads directly to the inner part of the board. If you put a pin here it goes down directly.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to get rid of your pins as fast a possible. The pins are distributed amongst the players.&#10;&#10;On your turn you roll the die and you put a pin in the boring with the number you have rolled, if that is still free. You can choose to  roll again or you can pass and give the turn to the next player.&#10;&#10;If the rolled boring is already occupied, you have to take the pin and your turn ends.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one of the players got rid of all his pins.&#10;&#10;"

A typical card will have three boxes at the bottom and in each box there will be a number. For example, the first box might say 8, the second box 7 and the third box +12. The first box is how many spaces you go up the track on the board. The second box is how many you go back, so, in my example, you go forward 8 and back 7 (a gain of 1 forward). The third box is the risk number. If you decide to take a risk, you roll the three dice and if you roll or beat the number (12 in my example) in the third box, you avoid the minus amount in box 2. But if you don't roll enough, then the minus points are doubled.&#10;&#10;At certain points when you cross spaces marked in red on the board, you draw the top card from the Teacher's deck and apply the numbers by adding them to the card played. This will normally result in higher moves, higher minuses and the dice roll needed if you decide to take a risk to avoid the minus number.&#10;&#10;The one with the most advanced spot on the board when the 60 Pupil cards have been used up, wins.&#10;&#10;Despite the common name and similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Silence in Class!&#10;&#10;"

This allows players with DBx-based armies to play Hoplon with only minimum changes necessary.   &#10; Although designed for 15mm miniatures, the system also supports 25/28mm play.  Hoplon has been extensively play-tested in clubs and by members of a dedicated Yahoo group, and this testing has led to a number of revisions which have been incorporated into the third edition.&#10;&#10;The philosophy behind Hoplon is to provide an easy-to-learn but deep system emphasizing the relative capabilities of different troop types and morale classes, the difficulties of effective command and control and -most of all - the close matching of historical tactics and performance.&#10;&#10;In Hoplon, armies are separated into commands, and commands are separated into units. Troops are activated and controlled by means of command points. While single elements can function individually, they do so at a cost when detached from their parent formations, losing their unit's stamina, cohesion bonus, and ability to maneuver in groups. This in turn forces players to deal with the tactical control problems inherent in commanding large bodies of ancient and medieval troops. Sequence of play is by interleaved-Command (both players moving on the same round by order of initiative of their commands) rather than alternating on every round, which makes tactical decision-making all the more interesting.&#10;&#10;While it uses a points system and army lists loosely based on the DBM model, Hoplon has taken a fresh approach to game-play which provides a realistic and historically satisfying simulation of ancient and medieval warfare. As a result, most historical battles require little or no tweaking to re-fight making this set a real tool for simulating actual battles.&#10;&#10;"
