It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board).&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, for every viable area with one or more empty points, place a stone of your color on one of those points.&#10;&#10;A viable area is a viable point along with all other such points one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent viable points. A viable point is a point that is empty or occupied by a friendly stone.&#10;&#10;When the board is full, the player with fewer stones on the board wins. If there is a tie, whoever placed the last stone wins. Ties are only possible on even-sized boards.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, the second player will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesWalling off areas of the board with your stones multiplies enemy placements, but be mindful that your opponent will try to use those extra placements to enclose new areas that multiply your own placements.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The title translates to &quot;build a nest&quot; and refers to getting your own place of residence (with someone).&#10;&#10;Players roll a die and move around a circuit performing transactions and purchasing furniture or car tiles. Occasionally a wheel is spun which mostly leads to more purchases but may indicate taking a loan, selling a tile to the bank or auctioning off an excess tile to the other players. A player wins by paying their initial mortgage, obtaining a full set of tiles, and having at least 5,000 in money.&#10;&#10;"

There are 4 legendary treasures, each with a different win condition once discovered. Each player can only obtain 1 win condition, and players do not know which one they will get until they find it.&#10;&#10;This game is all about upgrading things. Players get cards and slide paperclips to track how far their upgrades have progressed. They must spend energy and/or money to upgrade stuff. Upgrades include things such as energy generation, cargo capacity (hand limit), drill (allows mining deeper), hull (allows selling of hazards), and the scanner (allows looking at the top cards of the deck).&#10;&#10;The mining is represented by 4 decks of levels 1-4. The deeper levels require upgraded drills and more energy, but have better rewards. Players can sell their loot to gain more money, which is then used to upgrade their operation further.&#10;&#10;Since players do not know their win condition in advance, there is an incentive to find it early and start working towards it, but this comes at the cost of being able to amass certain upgrades that are expensive but can quickly snowball.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

You have two of these under your control and share each one with a rival. You also have a secondary goal trying to bring &ldquo;light&rdquo; or &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; to the world. Working with and against your rivals you must prove to be the most powerful secret society in the world before the Era of Atlantis ends either in glory or in cataclysm.&#10;&#10;This is an area-control and worker placement game with a unique twist. You control two nations with the lower-valued one counting for your score at game end. This means you will usually try to balance the two. You also share control of each one with another player, who has the same interest in the success of that nation as you do. Switching control of a nation is also possible, but difficult.&#10;&#10;There are ways to score a few additional points for yourself only, such as with your remaining mystical energy or by fulfilling secret objectives.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a variable number of rounds, with each player taking a turn per round. There are two main ways to gain new areas for your nation: militarily or politically. You can also expand your abilities by constructing buildings or acquiring powerful special actions. A nation will grow more successfully the better its two controlling players can cooperate.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Game play is lightning fast, with minimal downtime. Whether you're playing two or six players, it's your turn before you know it.&#10;&#10;In Waddle Waddle, you play the role of a Penguin Hero, specializing in a particular Penguin Species. Each Penguin Hero is based on a real-life Penguin Hero who works to conserve penguins! They will help you to study penguins as they leave the Ice Floe and travel to their nesting grounds in the Antarctic region, called Rookeries. There&rsquo;s safety in numbers, so penguins travel in groups called Waddles. As a Penguin Hero, you tag Waddles, scoring Conservation Points for each Waddle.&#10;&#10;Waddles that contain Mating Pairs make Nests. Score extra Conservation Points at the end of each Breeding Season if you tag the most Nests in a Rookery. You also get player-specific bonuses when you tag the Nests of the Penguin Species your Penguin Hero specializes in.&#10;&#10;Each penguin is represented by a Penguin Card with a number indicating its pecking order in the penguin social hierarchy. Only compatible penguins will travel together. There are six different Penguin Species that each like to nest in different places.
