Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.&#10;&#10;To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.&#10;&#10;This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s.&#10;&#10;"

The game depicts a space race from Earth to Saturn (hence the dinky Dan Dare style metal spaceships).&#10;&#10;Later Astron was published as an around-the-world travel game.&#10;&#10;Even later this around-the-world travel game was given the more apt name Sky Lanes otherwise using the same components.&#10;&#10;The special feature common to all versions is a game board that scrolls from one end to the other. Players are dealt cards to help them both in moving their rocket or plane and in scrolling the game board. In the travel version each time a player's plane sits on an airport space at the end of any player's turn, they get an Airport card. Similarly, if a player's plane ends any turn on a hazard, they draw a Hazard card.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to have the most points in hand when the board reaches the &quot;GAME OVER&quot; position. Airport cards add to your point total; Hazards subtract from it.&#10;&#10;While the rolling board, card drafting mechanism and even game play are the same, the British (Waddingtons) and American (Parker) games look very different.  There are pictures of both versions in the gallery.&#10;&#10;The game was released at a time in the period when commercial air travel was really taking off.&#10;&#10;"

Once a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy now sides with the Entente. Italy's dream is of annexing Austro-Hungarian territory inhabited by ethnic Italians. Austria-Hungary views Italy not only as traitorous, but also as its traditional enemy. The stage is set for a bloodbath. The Italian army attempts to cross a narrow path into Austria-Hungary, across the Isonzo River towards Trieste. There the Austro-Hungarian army is dug in and waiting for them.&#10;&#10;May 1916 - The Strafexpedition&#10;&#10;The Chief of Staff of the Austro Hungarian army, Conrad von Hotzendorff, feels the time is right to punish Italy. He ignores the German chief Falkenhayn who foresees problems on the Eastern Front. Conrad masses guns and men in the Tirol for a strike to cut off the Italian armies to the east along the Isonzo. The plan looks good on paper, but the attacks will take place across rugged country. The Italians in the southern Tirol have neglected their rear area defenses. Italian reinforcements rush to the area. It is a dicey affair, but the Italian lines hold fast. The peril to the Italian forces along the Isonzo is checked.&#10;&#10;May 1917 - Tenth Isonzo&#10;&#10;Again and again and again, valiant Italian infantry has been fed into the maelstrom of the Isonzo. Each battle differs from the last only by their increasing intensity. The 9th Isonzo battle brought the capture of Gorizia. Now the Italians work to enlarge their holdings on the east of the bloody Isonzo. In the end, each side is once again exhausted. The Italians have become weary of the war. Yet, the Austrians feel that one more attack along the Isonzo may be the one that breaks their army first.&#10;October 1917 - Caporreto&#10;With Russia just about finished, the German army turns to help its beleaguered ally. Crack German divisions are sent to the Italian front to remove the mortal threat to Austria-Hungary. The Austrians reinforce the front with specially trained assault units. The Italians along the headwaters of the Isonzo are overwhelmed. German and Austrian units pour through the mountain gaps and into the Italian rear. Italian units melt away in the rush to get out of the trap. The gains of the Isonzo battles are permanently lost. Enterprising Austrians cross the Tagliamento River. Further Italian retreats ensue. The rout of the Italians ends along the banks of the Piave, the last natural barrier before Venice and the open country of the Po Valley. But Italy is not defeated, and her citizens rally anew to the cause.&#10;&#10;June 1918 - Albrecht &amp; Radetzky&#10;&#10;The Germans are on the attack in France. Conrad wants in on the glory. Although the soldiers of the once proud Habsburg armies are weak and emaciated, they will have to go on the offensive one more time. As so often before, the Austrians split their strength between Conrad's armies in the Tirol and the forces along the Piave. Conrad's attacks from the north are ineffective. Once again the Marshal has made unrealistic plans his forces cannot execute. In the rugged mountain terrain only a single division manages to make any gains. Initial attacks across the Piave are successful, but quickly bog down. The Austrians have crossed the river, but cannot push far enough forward on the west bank to keep their pontoon bridges out of range of Italian artillery. Unable to advance, and unable to maintain viable supply lines across the river, they cross back, only to await the end.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;&#10;       560 Die-Cut Counters&#10;       One 34in x 22in Map&#10;       Scenario Rulebook, Charts, and Tables&#10;&#10;&#10;Scale is 20km / hex&#10;4 days per turn&#10;Unit Sizes: Division / Brigade&#10;&#10;(from the publisher's website and user's description)&#10;&#10;"

7767,,"A game of gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome. Played using counters or miniatures figures (54mm or 25mm) on a hex grid. For two or more players.&#10;&#10;Gladiators was designed as a system for single figure miniatures combat. But it is more like a role-playing game's combat system than a traditional miniatures system. Combat takes place on a hex grid making Gladiators similar in nature to Steve Jackson's Melee system (the combat system which evolved into The Fantasy Trip which eventually evolved into GURPS). Of course, the rules are a bit more specialized than Melee in that they focus on the gladiator combat of ancient Rome.&#10;&#10;Gladiators took two years of play-testing and conceptual development to create. A set of playable yet detailed and realistic rules for simulating gladiatorial combat. Players will be able to move their gladiators, feint, and dodge about as they prepare to lunge at their adversaries. They can slash or jab at their chosen targets, and must parry the return blows of their opponent. Shields can be used to bash opponents off guard. Accidents also have a place in this simulated universe. Men can trip or stumble, weapons or shields can be dropped, or nets cut to shreds. In short, an imaginative player can momentarily enter the arena and prepare himself for a contest which will be won or lost by the same elements that brought victory or defeat, fame and wealth or sudden death to a gladiator. Skills, cleverness, foresight, and luck all play their respective roles.&#10;&#10;These rules open a new dimension of wargaming--the realistic and exciting simulation of one man versus one man in the arena. Give them a try. You'll find a game hard to beat for moments of challenge.&#10;&#10;Contains 1 cardstock sheet of tables printed on both sides and 1 cardstock hex sheet printed on both sides (2 difference sized hexes, one size on each printed side).&#10;&#10;"

This means that each figure can represent ten men, one hundred men, or even one thousand men.
