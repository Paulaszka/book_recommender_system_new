Each character in the posse can be customized to fulfill a different role and purchase weapons and equipment from the many options available. Combat takes place in the futuristic landscape of the year 2285, where a supervolcano erupted and changed the course of mankind forever.&#10;&#10;In the general the game is built around D12s and is meant to be light, thematic, and fast playing. Players build a Posse containing a Leader, 2-4 Members, and up to 1 Dinosaur, all of which benefit from some unique mechanics. Each Member has an Allegiance such as Duster or Neotechnoist which helps differentiate them (both thematically and statistically). Otherwise there are fairly standard statistics (Speed, Defense, Hitpoints, etc.) which can be customized by spending Improvement Points to really help define a role for each character. Furthermore Active and Passive Traits are selected to let characters do cool things like Crippling Shot, Speed Reload, Go For the Eyes, etc. Weapons and equipment are then purchased from a list of over 75 items ranging from laser Six-Shooters to plasma Shotguns.&#10;&#10;A standard game takes place on a tabletop covered in terrain and uses 28mm miniatures and plastic dinosaur toys. Activation of entities is done on a model-by-model basis instead of the entire Posse at once, so the battles are very fluid with plenty of time to react to the enemy. This is especially true as Initiative is rolled at the start of each Activation &quot;set&quot; instead of staying the same for the whole turn.&#10;&#10;Posses battle each other in one-off standalone games or in a linked campaign where further Improvement Points and Neodollars can be used to build and grow the group. Likewise injuries can accrue on characters that were taken out of action during an encounter. Deployment, objectives, and features can be used to add depth and variety to each battle beyond &quot;kill everything&quot;.&#10;&#10;The full rules are free to download and can be used with any range of miniatures. There is also a free &quot;beginner version&quot; (called Quickdraw) which condenses the core mechanics to under 10 pages, so players can jump into the game very easily.&#10;&#10;"

Intelligent robots that could think and feel inhabited the cities. They were called Autobots and Decepticons. But the brutal Decepticons were driven by a single goal: total domination. They set out to destroy the peace-loving Autobots, and a war between the forces of good and evil raged across Cybertron, devastating all in its path, draining the planet's once rich sources of energy. The Autobots, on the verge of extinction, battled valiantly to survive.&quot; - The Opening Narration from &quot;More Than Meets the Eye, Part I&#10;&#10;When an elite team of Autobots left Cybertron in search of energon, they were pursued by Megatron and his Decepticons. They crashed on Earth four million years ago and fell into a state of involuntary hibernation. Then, in 1984 they awakened, making Earth into a battlefield, with energon as the prize. Now the heroic Optimus Prime and his valiant Autobots must stop Megatron and the cruel Decepticons from plundering the Earth and fueling a war of galactic conquest.&#10;&#10;Transformers: Heavy Metal War is a card game that allows players to command their favorite Transformers from the first two seasons of the classic 1984 cartoon show. Each player must manage their hand and deploy Transformers with a variety of powers in order to complete missions, each giving the victor a unique reward. You will not only have the likes of Wheeljack, Jazz, Starscream, and Soundwave at your command, but also a host of lesser known Transformers, including Tracks and Reflector, as well as cards for human allies and unforeseen events.&#10;&#10;So what are you waiting for? &quot;Transform and roll out!&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Your teammates can then improve the impact of your throw, including through the play of the powerful Hurry Hard! sweeping card to help get your rock a little closer to the button. Watch out though!  Your opponents can also affect your throw.  The timely play of a Miss the Broom card can ruin an end, unless you have a Plan B card in reserve.  After the player with The Hammer throws the last rock, the score for the end is calculated the same as in real curling, based on whose rocks are closest to the button.  Then a new end begins.&#10;&#10;For non-curlers, the rules explain not just how to play the card game, but also the basic terminology to help you understand the game of curling itself.&#10;&#10;For curlers, the game has been well balanced to reward real curling strategy.  Deciding when to throw a guard or when to come into the rings can make the difference between scoring a big end or giving up a steal.

Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.&#10;&#10;What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players &quot;build&quot; at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are &quot;defensive&quot; minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!&#10;&#10;In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot;. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.&#10;&#10;As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week. Don't let the enemy find the Shipyard where your damaged Destroyers limped home last time &ndash; if he does, they're toast!&#10;&#10;"

The 12 animals at the zoo are placed easily accessible for everyone in the middle. The player whose turn it is draws the top animal card and all players look at it. &#10;The player who first recognizes which animal is missing or is too many, takes the animal figure from the table. Who gets the proper figure, receives the card. The beast goes back to the middle. If nobody got the right animal, the card goes out of play. When all cards are played, the child with the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;"

The board has some similarities to that of games in the Morris family, though piece placement is guided by die roll.  The game's objective is to form sets of three pieces in a row, either via direct placement or via moving the pieces along lines on the board, with victory coming when a player reaches 16 points.&#10;&#10;"

These signals get the workers what they need, where they need it, when they need it to create a just-in-time (JIT) production system.&#10;&#10;The setting for the game Kanban: Automotive Revolution is an assembly line. The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate &mdash; anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable &mdash; failure &mdash; which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.&#10;&#10;Like the process itself, Kanban: Automotive Revolution proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.&#10;    Two independent player-influenced game timers &mdash; the factory production cycle and work week clock &mdash; provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.&#10;    A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.&#10;    A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.&#10;    Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. Kanban: Automotive Revolution is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.&#10;&#10;"

This epic treatment of the Napoleonic period covers 24 years of warfare at the strategic level.&#10;&#10;Nations in Arms uses a extensively updated, modified and streamlined version of the Le Grand Empire game system from Pratzen Editions (that game covered the 1800-1815 time period). The result is that Nations in Arms is an entirely new, and very playable, Napoleonic epic from designer Fran&#195;&#167;ois-Stanislas Thomas.&#10;&#10;Players control every major and minor power of the Napoleonic period: from the largest participants to the smallest. This allows anywhere from 2 to 7 players to participate in the game. Players are challenged with strategically managing their annual national production, diplomacy, and most importantly, war.&#10;&#10;The game systems emphasize the military importance of lines of communication, the command and control ability of skilled leaders, quality of troops above quantity, and the impact of battle, epic sieges and attrition on a nation. You will have the power of great leaders at your fingertips, and the might of the corps they commanded: line infantry, guards, militia, supply trains, light and reserve cavalry, fleets and more.&#10;&#10;Each game year is broken into four interactive, seasonal turns. A Chit Activation system is used to recreate the &lsquo;chaos of war&rsquo;, and events occur using an Historical Event card deck. This combination of variable chit pull and card play ensures a high replay value of the ten (10) scenarios. Nations in Arms features a one-turn tutorial scenario , four epic campaign scenarios, and five smaller scenarios.&#10;&#10;Now it&rsquo;s your turn to either fan the flames of The French Revolution throughout Europe, or to preserve the Old Order&hellip;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    2 map sections making a 56&rdquo; wide by 39&rdquo; high playing area&#10;    4 countersheets&#10;    6 full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cards with various tables, charts  and player aids&#10;    1 card deck (110 cards) of historical and tactical events&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    1 scenario booklet&#10;    2 dice&#10;    1 box and lid set - the big 3&rdquo; deep box&#10;&#10;&#10;"
