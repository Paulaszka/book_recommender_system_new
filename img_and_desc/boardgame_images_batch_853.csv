The object is to trap your opponent so that they have no legal moves (or, conversely, to avoid being trapped as long as possible).  Your pieces need to keep moving and the board quickly fills with blocks, forcing you towards the endgame.&#10;&#10;Each player has a power based on a mythological character, creature or artifact.  They have one prize and two rescuers.  Each turn they must move their prize (leaving a block behind) then one of the rescuers (which then builds on or excavates from a neighbouring space).  Since pieces can't move up more than one level and spaces become blocked off, one player will eventually run out of legal moves and lose -- usually when their prize is trapped by a combination of pieces and terrain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Turns are simultaneous. A round begins with a card draw, then each player may play a card face-down as an energy card. Then, players roll their Bakugan (spheres which transform via a magnet) at the hide matrix, a series of metallic tiles each of which is referred to a Baku-core. Brawls are resolved by comparing BP with ties determined by flipping a card, with the higher cost breaking the tie. The winner will the deal damage to the opponent based on its damage value.

Fold the wings of the shield and stand it in front of you.&#10;After putting all the tiles in the pocket, mix them well and split them equally among the players.(22 pieces each for 4 people)&#10;When playing with 3 players, each player takes 29 tiles and leave the remaining 1 tile in the pocket. The tiles taken from the pocket are taken inside the shield. Cover the tiles well and turn them all over so other players can't see them. &#10;If the game is played by 2 players, place all 5 colored &ldquo;1&rdquo; tiles in the center of the table and put all remaining tiles in the pocket and mix well. Each person takes 30 tiles from the pocket. Leave the remaining tiles in the pocket and do not use them. Then, hide all the tiles in the shield so that other players can&rsquo;t see them and turn them all over.&#10;If you put the tiles of the same color together, it will be helpful for you to play the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;         STARTING SETTING&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;- 4 Players : 22 Tiles&#10;- 3 Players : 29 Tiles&#10;- 4 Players : 30 Tiles&#10;&#10;&#10;        GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Every tile you own is your negative score. The goal of Sixteen is to put down all the tiles you own first, or leave the fewest number of tiles. Tiles can be placed one color per turn, and must be placed in a higher number (in ascending order) than the number of tiles placed at the very end. You can also create an opportunity to remove remaining tiles by using 16END and 16RESTART tiles and special tiles such as scissors and trash cans. Make strategies by predicting other player&rsquo;s remaining tiles.&#10;&#10;&#10;         SPECIAL TILES&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;- 16 RESTART(5 : 1 per color) : You can restart the row by resetting the row of that color to the number '1'. Place a tile and pass the turn to the next player.&#10;- 16 END(5 : 1 per color) : You can finish the row of that color. 16END tiles can be removed with scissors or trash bin tiles, but you cannot place 16RESTART tiles.&#10;- Scissor tile(2) : You can remove one of the last tiles in a row. After removing it, you can place the tile one more time. You can only place the tile on the row that you used scissor tiles, or you can use scissor tiles only. Place the removed tiles and used scissor tiles separately next to the table.&#10;- Trash Bin Tiles(1) : You can discard as many tiles as you like, except for tile '1' in a row. You can place the tile one more time after discarding it. You can only place the tile once more on the line where you used the trash can tile, or you can use the trash can tile only. Put the discarded tiles and the used trash can tiles separately next to the table.&#10;&#10;&#10;         PLAYING THE GAME&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;If there is a tile with the number '1', place it all in the center of the table. The game is played clockwise starting with the player with the red number '1' tile. In the case of 2 players, a random player will be selected to start the game.&#10;When it's your turn, you can place down a tile once. Only tiles of one color can be placed down at a time. Each color of tiles with a number greater than the number of tiles placed at the end (in ascending order) can be placed. You cannot place a tile with a number smaller than the number of tiles placed at the end.&#10;If the ascending order conditions are satisfied, tiles can be laid down in two ways.&#10;(Default) : Place a larger number of tiles than the one placed at the end&#10;(Group) : Lay down a group of consecutive tiles&#10;&#10;&#10;         END OF THE GAME&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;There are two ways to end a game. If either of them applies, the game ends immediately.&#10;First, if a player has laid down all of their tiles, the game ends immediately and that player wins.&#10;Second, if all players yell &lsquo;PASS&rsquo; in one round, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;[How to calculate points]&#10;All the player remove theirs shield and add the number of tiles they have left.&#10;For any remaining 16 END and 16RESTART tiles, add 16 points. For scissors and trash bin tiles add 20 points each.&#10;Consecutive tiles must be in ascending order. If there is no break in the middle, the number of tiles can be placed down at once without a limit. 16END and 16RESTART can also be put down in groups. However, you can't lay down two 16 tiles at once. (Yes. You cannot put down 16END after 16RESTART in one turn)&#10;&#10;After putting down the 16END and 16RESTART tiles, hand over the turn to the next player. After using scissors and trash can tiles, you can place down tiles of the corresponding color one more time, and this action is optional and not required. Scissors and trash can must be used until the game ends. If you don't use them and keep them till the end of the game, you get -20 points.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Pass&rdquo; if there are no tiles that can be put down in your turn. When your turn comes back, if there's a tile you can put down, put the tile down again and hand over the turn to the next player. The game continues until all players yell PASS or one player has put down all of the tiles they had.&#10;&#10;If  the calculation is over, the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;If there is a tie, compare the number of tiles and the one with fewer tiles wins.&#10;Ex) When 2 people are tied for the 1st place (19 points), the number of their tiles is compared. The 1PLAYER has 3 tiles, and the 2PLAYER has 2 tiles. Therefore, the 2PLAYER who has 1 less tile wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;         Contact Publisher&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;MAGICBEANGAMES(Republic of Korea)&#10;e-mail : magicbean@magicbeangame.com&#10;&#10;"

In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play.

Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!&#10;&#10;Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.&#10;&#10;In Monochrome Inc., players have been instructed to break into the research building named in the game's title, and once they get inside this tower's mirrored windows, they are left on their own. What they find there, what conclusions they draw from these items, and how this nerve-wracking story ends is entirely in their hands. Only by co-ordinating their team will they avoid potential pitfalls, carry out their mission, and solve the mystery of this building.&#10;&#10;"

With the discovery of Magic, however, came the potential for dramatic change in the world &ndash; for good or evil. Centuries after the discovery of the Art, magic has shaped the fears and hopes of countless people, and the heroes and villains that wield it have decided the fate of nations over all these years. Yet for all this struggle, a tenuous balance remained between those who seek to strengthen all Mortal Races and those that seek to lord over them. Little do they know however that amidst the shadowed boughs of the Dead Irall, an ancient evil seeks to rule once again. Few are aware that the fate of the land now lies with brave heroes who are the only ones who can prevent the oncoming Age of Darkness.&#10;&#10;Chronicles of Drunagor - Age of Darkness is a fully cooperative and strategy board game of tactical combat in a dungeon crawl adventure for one to five players. CoD-AoD is based on multiple 3D scenarios, each of them played separately or on a continuous storyline. Each scenario has its own unique setup, darkness rules and different goals that will be needed to be achieved in order to obtain victory. Played over a series of rounds until either the chosen adventure objective is achieved by the heroes or a single hero dies or is corrupted by the darkness itself. The order of activation is dictated by the initiative track and it alternates between heroes, monsters and the darkness itself. Once they all activate, a round is over and a new one begins, so players win or lose as a team. The game is won when the adventure objectives are met. The game is lost when one player is either killed or corrupted by darkness.&#10;&#10;On a hero&rsquo;s turn he can freely move up to 3 spaces (orthogonal and or diagonal are permitted) and spend 2 of his action cubes to trigger his abilities. If when passing his turn he no longer has any cubes on his available action cubes pool, he must perform a recall action. On a monster activation he will always move to attack the heroes. Or if he`s in range of his target he will attack without even move. Each monster has its own primary target located on his card at the initiative track. On the darkness activation, draw from the bag the number of darkness tokens dictated by the chosen adventure and follow the darkness rules for that adventure.&#10;&#10;As you go by the different adventures, your heroes will find themselfs in a wide variety of scenarios and instead of only reading thru the descriptions of the place you are, the game will show you beautifull illustrations of what you can see and how you can interact with the scenario. Every choice on how you interact with certain things could possibly change the way your adventure continues. Maybe you will find a secret passage, or maybe you can find a locked chest, the choice is up to you.&#10;&#10;Choose one of the heroes and take upon this quest to defeat the power of evil and the everlasting darkness from the land of Daren.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
