The game involves various farming related obstacles and successes, mainly based around farming machinery. So for example successes include &quot;You now have your new tractor - succeed as usual&quot;, &quot;A post hole digger to re-fence your field - go forward&quot;, &quot;Ploughing demonstration - go forward&quot;, &quot;Good hammer milled feed keeps up milk yield - transport box moves churns easily - go forward&quot;. Obstacles include &quot;Tractor oil should have been changed - go back&quot;, &quot;Your field is flooded - go back&quot;, &quot;Tractor neglected - go back&quot; etc. &#10;The first player to finish exactly on 200 has arrived at the market and is the winner.&#10;&#10;The graphics on game board are lovely. The course goes through typical English landscape starting at an old farm house, and then through country lanes, ploughed fields, past the &bdquo;Ferguson School of Farm Mechanisation&ldquo; (Massey Ferguson farm machinery), past streams, bridges, churches, farmyards, hay bales, and various farm vehicles to a market in a little town at the end. The board provides an image of a lost, bygone England.&#10;&#10;"

As the title suggests &ndash; it has a mountaineering theme, which is highlighted by the image on the box lid.&#10;&#10;It is a simple race game, played with dice and counters. But what makes it more attractive is that the board &ndash; which is stored folded in the box needs to be stood up inside the box base to form a mountain. You start at the bottom of one side and the first person to reach 100 is the winner. You go up one side and then down the other. Instead of &lsquo;squares&rsquo; on a regular board this one has numbered holes. The reason for this is that the counters slot into those holes. There are four 1&frac12;&rdquo; high metal climbers. They actually look as if they are Boy Scouts. The figures are identical except that their shorts are different colours. They are red, yellow, green and blue.&#10;&#10;"

There are five special spaces which when landed on let the player make another move with the same piece or a piece of the same color, counting it as part of the same move.&#10;&#10;The object is to get the five pieces of each color in a connected group. The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or by multiple players; the designer suggests playing with two by trading off setting up boards for the opponent (the goal being to solve the opponent's puzzle in fewer moves than they solve yours), or any number by each trying to solve the same puzzle in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;"
