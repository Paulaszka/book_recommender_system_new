If you can't mark off one or two cities based on the die results, then you must place an X through one or two cities. You have two special powers you can use once each game: re-rolling 1-4 dice when you're the active roller, and re-using a digit on one die in each of the two-digit numbers you create that turn.&#10;&#10;After thirteen turns, the game ends. You score 1 point for each marked bonus box and -1 point for each X. If you have four or more cities in consecutive order, e.g., 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, then you score 2-9 points based on the length of the chain. You also identify your longest chain of non-X cities that are in increasing order and score 1 point for each city. Finally, you score 0-9 points based on how many of the three zones have no Xed cities. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

Lee, leading the Army of Northern Virginia defeated the Army of the Potomac, commanded by the Union general George McClellan during the Seven Days Battles, thereby saving Richmond. Having put an end to the Union&rsquo;s Peninsula campaign, Lee decided to put pressure on Washington and regain the initiative. Though outnumbered, he would do his utmost to avoid the junction of the Union armies in the Eastern Theater. His first target was the new and inexperienced Army of Virginia led by the Union general John Pope. Lee dispatched General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson (victorious in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of the previous winter)   to intercept the Union. The vanguard of both armies met in Culpeper County in Virginia. The Union general Banks positioned his artillery on the ridge near Cedar Mountain and a cannon battle ensued. The Confederate general Winder, leading the southerners, was mortally wounded in action, resulting in confusion and withdrawal for the south. Upon seeing this, Stonewall advanced the reserves and led the counter-attack himself. Faced with this unexpected wave, the Union line was broken and the soldiers retreated in disorder.&#10;&#10;As Jackson, will you be able to win the first battle of the Northern Virginia Campaign or will you change the course of history wearing Banks&rsquo; blue uniform?&#10;&#10;This game published in VaeVictis #153 uses the Civil War Brigade Battle system (Worthington Games).&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;Complexity : 4/10&#10;Solo playability : 7/10&#10;Duration : 1 hour 30&#10;One turn = 40 minutes&#10;One counter = 1 brigade&#10;Scale : 200 meters&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The imps (players) take turns to place their tokens onto the game board. The goal is to build a roof by occupying all three spaces that form a red or blue triangle.  If a player completes a roof, he may remove an opponent token from the board. When all tokens are placed, the players move 1 token by one space each turn. To move between red and blue spaces is only possible via the greeen space in the center of the board. Any token moving onto the green space has to leave it next turn.&#10;&#10;The first player who has only two tokens left, loses the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.&#10;&#10;On each turn, four destination cards are available, corresponding to stations on the map. You can take up to four actions; an action is either building track by placing one of your track tokens on the board or taking a branch token. A player may use two branch tokens to branch out of an existing line (whereas normally lines can be extended only at the endpoints). After each player's turn, a passenger token is moved along players' lines, avoiding walking as much as possible, to reach one or two destinations determined at the beginning of the turn. Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, then the next player takes their turn.&#10;&#10;Players score points in two ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;     By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by collecting landmark tiles (in Paris), by connecting stations across water (in New York) or at the end of the game if they have achieved their secret objectives (in Paris).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     By having the passenger use their lines when moving.&#10;&#10;&#10;After all destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Paris is a thoughtful map offering many options. To win, you need to strike the right balance between collecting sets of tokens, connecting secret destinations, blocking other players while not being blocked yourself, and of course carrying the passenger. Paris is the refined elder sister of the original On the Underground: London map and is recommended for experienced players.&#10;&#10;New York is a fast-paced map reflecting the hectic pace of life in the Big Apple. It encourages players to mirror real life by creating lines through Manhattan, but you have to build quickly to keep up with the always-moving passenger.&#10;&#10;"
