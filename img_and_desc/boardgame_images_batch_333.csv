Dunnigan in 1973. It presents a two-player, complex historical simulation of the air, sea and land campaigns waged on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the summer and fall of 1942. The game begins with the American invasion of that island and includes the subsequent Japanese attempts to retake it. The game is intended to be a simulation of combined air-naval-ground operations, or what are today called &quot;joint operations&quot;. Consequently it centers on modeling command and staff systems, focusing on the difficulties and advantages inherent in sequenced interactions between and among air, naval and ground forces.&#10;&#10;"

At the end of a round the priestess receives the same score as the highest-scoring adept, encouraging her to make the rules difficult but not impossible to guess.&#10;&#10;"

Visualize sailing into the windward mark on a starboard tack, calling for right-a-way at the mark, or getting a big puff downwind to slip past several boats. Play by yourself or with up to eight players. Play your own boat by starting behind an imaginary line sailing to windward, tacking to avoid the head wind, rounding the mark, reaching to the second mark and on to the downwind leg of the course. The basic strategy involves port and starboard tacking and staying clear of the competition. Fun and instructive for the new sailor and a challenge for the experienced skipper. The whole family will love to play as there are no complicated wind changes and the game moves along at a pace that will keep everyone interested.
