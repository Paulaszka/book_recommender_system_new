The game includes a map illustrated by Jonathan Carnehl, stretching from the Pyrenees to Moscow, and from Norway to the Sudan, covering every square inch of territory in Europe and the Near East which saw combat from 1914 to 1918, in a manageable 34x22&quot; format. An additional map shows the German colonies&#10;&#10;The game also features 520 beautifully-illustrated counters depicting the national armies that fought in the war -- from the Germans, French, British and Russians all the way down to the Persians, Montenegrins, Armenians, South Africans, and a host of other specialized units (French Foreign Legion, Gurkhas, Italian &quot;Arditi&quot;, Cossacks, Tyrolean Kaiserjaeger, Zionists, Bavarians, &quot;Dunsterforce&quot;... even the Chinese may send a small expeditionary force).&#10;&#10;DEATH IN THE TRENCHES includes a 28-page rulebook (and an additional 20 pages of setups and random events) detailing the game's unique combat system (no CRT!) which portrays the grinding nature of World War I combat in a realistic way that still gives players plenty of options to pursue. Using army-level units (which contain numbers of divisional level formations, represented off-map), players use numerous special military abilities to drive back the enemy.&#10;&#10;Detailed random events rules give you more gory details about World War I than you've ever seen before in a game, while helping keep play simple and straightforward. Lenin, the Senussi revolt, intrigue in the Romanian court, the Cruise of the Emden, the Armenian Massacre, the Sinai Pipeline, the Ukrainian Reactionary Hetmanate, Rasputin, Mata Hari, the Russian shell shortage, the murder of Edith Cavell, Wilhelm Wassmuss (the &quot;German Lawrence&quot;), Lawrence of Arabia, the Nestorian resistance, Pancho Villa, the Grand Duke Nicholas, Thomas Masaryk, the Red Baron, Czech Legion, Irish Rising, Berber Revolt, air raids, typhus, influenza... they're all here.&#10;&#10;For the World War I buff, &quot;DITT&quot; has everything: Tanks, Alpenkorps, artillery barrages, flamethrowers, poison gas, Krupp guns, Mustapha Kemal, the Royal Air Force, French elan... while the great wartime leaders all leave their mark (good or bad!) on history: Bruchmuller, Haig, Hoffmann, Mackensen, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, Rennenkampf and Samsonov, Sarrail, Von Francois, Foch, Brusilov, Nivelle, Plehve, Putnik, Yudenich... history is overflowing. Players command the armed forces of nearly forty nations, in a game that still manages to be small enough to fit on your table!&#10;&#10;It sounds like a massive game, but it isn't. DEATH IN THE TRENCHES is designed to be played--easy to play, hard to master. You'll learn things about World War I you never knew before, and you'll have to face the same crises the leaders of the Entente and Central Powers did. Think you can do better than Douglas Haig and Robert Nivelle? Now it's your turn.&#10;&#10;The original edition of Death in the Trenches won the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.&#10;&#10;The 2021 edition takes this WW1 classic to new heights, and features a revised and expanded combat system that preserves the charm of the original but is much more faithful to actual WWI battle numbers and provides much more detail on individual countries' distinctive military strengths and weaknesses. Each individual battle now takes place on an off-map display that simulates a real WWI battle, each battle opening with a &quot;spearhead&quot; force that drives into a &quot;target area&quot;. The system of entrenchment remains simple and easy to play, but takes into account the role of time and manpower in creating different levels of trench effectiveness.&#10;&#10;Added detail includes the Hindenburg Line, German siege guns, and the possible flight of the French government. Instability in the Balkans, and the allegiance of the Roumanian and Bulgarian governments, may lead to unexpected political reversals in Europe's turbulent &quot;backyard&quot;. The impact of the Russian Revolution is expanded, with several possible directions for Russia to travel including the rise of a better Czar, or even the takeover of Soviet Russia by Trotsky, which could bring Russia back into the war!&#10;&#10;The system of military reinforcements has been transformed, with greater reliance on historical unit production and manpower. Great Power support and sponsorship for minor country forces has been made a vital part of the game, and the &quot;major minors&quot; like Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria now have their own Army Reserves which give each country a more distinctive role.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

320067,,"Trepidation is a cooperative horror survival game, where players are trying trying to make it to the end of the forest. All players are given a role card at the beginning of the game, which is broken down by the townspeople and the possessed role. Townspeople are trying to make it to the end of the forest, while the possessed player is trying to have everyone killed before they reach the end.&#10;&#10;There are monsters and events standing in between you and your escape. Your survival will depend upon collecting and trading items, strategizing, and figuring out whom to trust in your party. Can you make it out of the forest alive?&#10;&#10;Every player is dealt a limited number of location and item cards. The location cards are used throughout the game to progress through the forest. Each location card will indicate whether you will draw an item, event, or monster card for that turn.&#10;&#10;There are unique location cards found within the deck called landmarks. The landmarks are what you will be searching for and must complete as a group to continue your progress through the forest. Depending on the difficulty you select at the beginning of the game, you will have to complete either 3, 5 or 7 landmarks to make it out of the forest. Planning ahead is a necessity, as the landmarks will force the entire party to combat monsters the moment they are played.&#10;&#10;Every monster has a unique way that it must be warded off. Some monsters are more problematic, and even more perilous to come across than others. Use your items and plan ahead in order to overcome that which awaits you and your team.&#10;&#10;Be careful, though, as the possessed player may try to deceive you. They can use the event, item and landmark cards to their advantage, and will try blending in as a normal towns person throughout the game... waiting until your guard is down before sabotaging you.&#10;&#10;"

It is possible for a single piece to complete the corners of several different squares.&#10;&#10;After a player sets a piece, they check to see if any new squares were formed. They make note of how many and keep a running total. A player is given a reasonable time to count up all the new squares, and then the next player may take his turn. If a player spots any new squares after the other players sets a piece, that player loses those points.&#10;&#10;After the last piece is set, the scores are tallied.

Each group competes with the others to be the most successful at gathering treasure for the dragons.&#10;&#10;Using strategy and cunning in Dragonland, each player moves their group of companions from volcano to volcano to collect sets of dragon eggs and gemstones. Each player scores points for each gemstone and egg, but extra points for a complete set: egg, ruby, emerald, and sapphire. All their movements are under the control of the tower of destiny, which sometimes arranges for a companion to reach their destination a bit too late. When the last egg is collected, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;For this edition of Dragonland, some new features have been added, specifically a unicorn mechanism and token and a witch mechanism and token. In addition, the game features completely new art and graphic design.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

The aim of the game is to be the player with the smallest sum in  hand by the end of the round. Platers are eliminated if their total reaches over 200 points. Once all other players have been eliminated, the remaining player is the winner. It is a derivative/reimplimentation of Yaniv.&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with a hand of 5 cards. On their turn, a player first discards one or more cards from the hand (sets of same cards or runs) and then takes a card from the deck or a previous discard. The main difference from the original Yaniv is the inclusion of tactic cards.&#10;&#10;"

During each round of the game, one player challenges the other players with a hypothetical scenario by playing a card from their hand. If the other players would never do it, then whoever played the card gets the point. If somebody (or multiple people) would do it, then they need to explain to the group how on Earth they could justify doing something that ridiculous. Whoever&rsquo;s answer is deemed the best wins the point in that instance.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player scores 10 points...or after everyone erupts into everlasting laughter and judgement of their friends.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
