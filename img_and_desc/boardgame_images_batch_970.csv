When the villages along the riverside eventually are accessible, a small river cruise company offers exotic tours like polar bear safaris, reindeer trips, ice fishing, and more. Lucky tourists may even get a chance to see the northern lights.&#10;&#10;You work as a tour guide trying to attract tourists to your guide boats for spectacular excursions.&#10;&#10;Riverside is a different kind of roll-and-write game: The game comes with a modular game board, which composes the route for the game. On a river cruise boat, everyone follows the same route, but you can take your tourists on different tours. You may plan ahead, but beware, the dice may force you to change your plans.&#10;&#10;You start each round by rolling dice into a common pool. Simultaneously, each player chooses one die of one specific color (without physically taking it) and fill seats on the matching guiding boat on their own player sheet. Whenever they have completed a row of seats, they have sold a group ticket of the corresponding color (excursion). The longer the row, the more points they get. Additionally, this ticket is valid for the remainder of the game: Every time they go on an excursion in a village of this color, they take this group with them to earn even more points. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each dice color represents tourists with a preference for one specific type of excursion. The transparent green die is &quot;wild&quot; and represents the northern lights, something everyone wants to see.&#10;&#10;Riverside offers tough decision-making within a short playing time: Some rows are short with low points and bonuses, while other rows are long with higher points and bonuses. Which one do you start to fill? Within each guide boat, you need to score higher and higher, so taking too many tourists on your first excursions could be fateful. Players are rewarded if they manage to please all five kinds of tourists, so maybe you need to score a new color instead of scoring really high in another color? Higher dice represent tourists who are freezing and cost fire symbols to get. Note that the &quot;wild&quot; green die always costs fire symbols to get! You have a limited number of fire symbols to use, so when will be the right time to use them?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players take on the roles of shipwrecked souls washing ashore at the base of a mountainous tower slowly crumbling away into the icy seas.

The inner city suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surrey Hills are a battleground between warring gangs led by prostitute Tilly Devine and sly grog queen Kate Leigh. And in the middle of it all is you, a detective for the New South Wales Police, just trying to solve the crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice.&#10;&#10;Razorhurst is a story-driven detective game similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. You will interview suspects, follow leads, and use your abilities for observation, persuasion and force. Razorhurst introduces a unique clock mechanic for affecting the player's abilities. But the main difference with other detective games is that in Razorhurst everything is real. You will be investigating actual crimes, tracking down historical evidence, and bringing actual killers to justice.

Roach Party was sold in head shops when they began popping up in the 80&rsquo;s. It had great success, sold thousands of copies and was even featured in High Times Magazine.

This is done by collecting all four of the ROACH CARDS. These include the BAGGIE, PAPERS, FIRE, and SUPPLIER cards.&#10;Lastly you must acquire the funds to pay your supplier.

The game is usually full of good (and bad ) emotions, as two main key aspects are timing and, as the name suggests, bluffing.&#10;&#10;Each round, players fight each other for one of the many different magical treasures. During one's turn, the player has two choices: either play a card with a symbol of the treasure of the round, or skip the turn, waiting for better opportunities, or simply missing the necessary card to play. Players take turns clockwise, deciding on the best strategy to win the treasure. Once a player holds a treasure for an entire turn, he gets to take it back to his ship and gains its special effect. The game is over, once a player collects 4 different treasures.&#10;&#10;The best part of the game is when you feel like a mastermind, like you've outsmarted all of your friends.  While everyone was fighting for the treasure, you were waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Just when one of your friends was about to take the treasure back to his ship, you laugh at his face and curb his expectations, by taking the treasure into your own hands. You feel ecstatic, you are about to win the game. And just at the moment when you think that you had it in the bag... One of your friends starts laughing at your face and you very well know, what's about to come.&#10;&#10;"
