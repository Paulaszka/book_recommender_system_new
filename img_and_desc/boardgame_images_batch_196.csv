The center area is called &quot;The Arena&quot; and it is 4x4 grid with alternating black &amp; white squares like a chessboard.  On each side there is a 3 x 4 &quot;Safety Zone&quot; which serves as the starting area for each player.  The safety zones are also arranged with alternating squares, although the squares are gray and the color of your pieces.&#10;Pieces move diagonally away from their &quot;safety zone&quot;.  No piece may enter any safety zone once it has entered The Arena. The goal is to move your pieces into the arena and create kings.  &#10;Initially, all pieces are &quot;pawns&quot; and can move only diagonally forward (away from their safety area).  Once they enter the arena, they can move diagonally in any direction but may not leave the arena.&#10;A player may create a &quot;prince&quot; by landing on an opponent's pawn with one of his pawns.  The stack of two pieces can then move either 1 or 2 spaces, still diagonally, but may move forwards or backwards.  It may not enter any safety zone (it must remain in the arena).&#10;A player creates a king when his prince takes a pawn or his pawn takes a prince (princes may not take each other).  A king is a stack of three pieces.  Once formed kings are removed to the scoring area.&#10;The game ends when there is no possibility of additional kings being made.  The winner is the player who has the most kings.&#10;Note that while the game says it will play 2-4 there are no rules offered for any number other than 4.&#10;&#10;"

They do not restrict the player to the circumstances of a given campaign, or to the capacities of actual units, or to the style of an actual leader. Both players are equipped with units whose capacities are equivalent to those of the era in which the game is set. But their forces and situations are abstract and equal, and each player must win or lose according to his own skill and judgment, without the influence of luck or of pre-existing historical conditions. There are no dice or chance outcomes.&#10;&#10;Chris's Comments&#10;The game is played on a map divided into equal squares using units to represent Infantry, artillery and Cavalry.  To make the game balanced the map is also symmetric about the line dividing the two sides.

Whenever a player ends his move on a white dot nothing happens and the next player gets to roll the dice. The red dots are 'special event' dots.

Then the tide of war changed when King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the &quot;Lion of the North,&quot; revitalized the cause of the Protestant princes of Germany. Bankrolled by France, the Swedes pushed their advantage towards the Emperor's most valuable ally, Maximilian of Bavaria. Though Catholic, France sought to keep the power of the Habsburgs in check by financially supporting the Swedish King.&#10;&#10;From 1632 to 1648, Bavaria and the surrounding area became a crucial battlefront to knocking Bavaria out of the war. The Swedes enjoyed success until fate removed their King and their over-extended forces could not hold onto their gains. After the Swedes suffered a sharp defeat at N&ouml;rdlingen in 1634, France was forced to play a more active role or lose all she had paid for. A series of seesaw campaigns ensued as the French Arm&eacute;e d'Allemagne secured crossings of the Rhine and pushed the war back into the heart of Bavaria. The area became the proving ground of the greatest generals of the age - Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Mercy, de Werth. Neither side possessed a clear superiority of forces so it was a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, march, counter-march, siege, and surprise attacks. After several years, a combined French-Swedish campaign finally broke the back of the Bavarians in 1646 and Maximilian made a separate peace. It did not last long; after a year he reluctantly rejoined the Imperial cause. Repeating the winning combination of 1646, the French-Swedish army ended Maximilian's enterprise at Zusmarshausen in 1648.&#10;&#10;Won by the Sword is the first game in Ben Hull's Great Campaigns of the Thirty Years War series. It is a two-player game of operational warfare in the 17th Century. Armies maneuver on a point to point map of Southern Germany based on the road network available at the time. Each game is centered around a major battle or full campaign season. A Turn is a month divided into a variable number of impulses. Each army has a hand of Campaign Cards that control the amount of activity it may perform, the supplies it must expend, and a special action. Each impulse features one card play per army. Forces are concealed off map so players are faced with limited knowledge of the enemy. The major activities are maneuver, foraging, besieging fortifications, and an occasional battle. Won by the Sword is a low-complexity game with emphasis on the players maneuvering their forces, but many decisions await. The low rules complexity allows each player, rather than being encumbered with rules, to focus on choices regarding how to manage his campaign.&#10;&#10;"

Once a player has a certificate, he draws and keeps (or discards) Loading cards until he has the exact amount of cargo required.&#10;&#10;Once fully loaded, a player enters the second phase of the game -- sailing. A player under sail chooses a sail state (full, 3/4, 1/2, storm), then draws a card and checks the resulting combination on their sailing wheel. There is a Total Loss card which, if followed by a second draw indicating bad weather or other calamity, can damage the player's ship or force him out of the game entirely.&#10;&#10;The first player to arrive safely in London is the winner.&#10;&#10;No copyright date is given, but a London game collector asserts the vintage for this game to be of the early 1930s. The subject matter is consistent with this estimate, in light of the Great Grain Race of 1932, and the box style (i.e., small label fixed to larger cover) fits that of the 1930s.&#10;&#10;"
