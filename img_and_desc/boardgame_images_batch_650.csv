In August of 1916, the Ottoman Empire sent an expeditionary force, which included contingents of Germans and Austro-Hungarians, against the canal. While the British were expecting an attack, the Ottomans gained tactical surprise by attacking at night. If the Ottoman attack had succeeded, Britain&rsquo;s prestige and warmaking capacity would be severely damaged.&#10;&#10;Suez 1916 uses the Fire &amp; Movement system. The movement and combat systems are designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.&#10;&#10;The historical battle was a touch-and-go affair, ending with the British pushing the Turks just far enough to keep the canal safe. The British have the stronger force, but the Central Powers has the advantages of surprise, initiative, and strong artillery support. The player who best utilizes his strengths and is prepared to capitalize on opportunities will prevail.&#10;&#10;Details:&#10;&#10;    Level: Regiment/Brigade&#10;    Hex: 0.6 miles (1 km) &#10;&#10;&#10;"

The lone German army there, Hindenburg&rsquo;s Eighth, had to rely on interior lines and railroads to concentrate against each Russian army in turn. This game focuses on the southern half of the campaign, with the northern half factored into the victory conditions. Those victory conditions vary with the strategic options chosen by each player so neither knows the other&rsquo;s intent.&#10;&#10;Tannenberg uses a modification of the Fire &amp; Movement game system. Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of rapidly-concentrated fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves. In 1914, although railroads allowed the rapid shifting of forces on a large scale, no one moved faster than a man on foot on the battlefield, making exploitation ineffective. However, here both players have hidden movement, allowing them to concentrate in unexpected locations to surround and destroy isolated enemy units. The clumsy and inflexible fire support is represented by the artillery brigades available to division and corps commanders. It must be brought to the point of decision, then supplied to give it the firepower to affect the fighting.&#10;&#10;The historical outcome at Tannenberg was the destruction of Samsonov&rsquo;s army, but it need not have been so. Both players have options and can achieve decisive success. The player who makes the better choices, and backs his strategy to the hilt, will emerge the victor.&#10;&#10;Details:&#10;&#10;    Level: Brigade&#10;    Hex: 3 miles (5 km)&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The game is won if you reveal all four kings -- however, if you are unable to purchase or exile a card on your turn, you must turn one of the kings sideways, raising suspicion of your plan. If all four kings are turned sideways and you need to raise suspicion again, the kings have caught on to your game, and have ordered your execution!&#10;&#10;Kinga contains a novel chaining mechanic for purchasing cards -- You first play a 'base' card that determines your value, then any number of other cards from your hand that match either the value or the suit of the previously played card. Each card beyond the first adds 1 to the total value of your currency, and the suits used determine the cards you may purchase. Playing 3 of a kind in a chain lets you draw 1 additional card immediately, and playing all four suits in a chain allows you to draw 2 additional cards immediately.&#10;&#10;"

Play thoughtfully, as everyone shares the cards in the Community! The second Spell is for building the Pot. In addition to Suit and Strength, every card has a point value. Cards played to the Pot contribute their points to the winner of each Showdown. Play cards to build a Pocket with the third Spell. (Never ask to see a wizard&rsquo;s pocket!) Each player takes one of their Pockets and combines it with the Community to form a hand during Showdowns. The best hand claims all points in the Pot.&#10;&#10;There is, of course, a twist. Trust a wizard to provide a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can compete in multiple Showdowns if they have the Pockets. Hocus is not merely a matter of building good hands, but making a winning hand where your opponents least expect and profiting with a hefty Pot. Timing and careful, targeted play will win the day. And time is limited. You may have conjured a Straight Flush, but it&rsquo;s worthless with no points in the Pot!&#10;&#10;Now, look at the other spells in the game. There are eight different spell books, each with their own unique approaches to the game, providing every wizard who plays with their own special abilities. The spell books raise the game to another level, with even more tools for bending luck to your advantage.&#10;&#10;Travel way back to a dark, dank inn, shuffle the cards, and play the favorite game of the legendary Merlin and Morgan le Fay. Hocus is a little like poker, but a lot more magic!&#10;&#10;"

The Red Army then launches the Bagration operation. Bringing considerable resources, over 2 million men and 4,000 tanks, it aims to liberate Belorussia. Taken by surprise, the German Army Group Center collapses quickly. The Soviets then advance 600 km in a month, causing an unprecedented defeat to the Germans. They are stopped at the gates of Warsaw, where the insurgency that has just started will be ruthlessly suppressed.&#10;&#10;But the Axis forces are not yet beaten and 10 months of fierce fighting will be necessary until the final victory.&#10;&#10;Victory Roads is a historical simulation retracing the campaign on the Eastern Front, from June 22, 1944, the day of the launch of the offensive Bagration in Byelorussia, until May 1945 in Berlin.&#10;&#10;Victory Roads uses the same game system as Liberty Roads, our wargame on the Western Front, from the D-Day to April 1945, while integrating the specific characteristics of this campaign. The counters are the divisions (Axis) and corps (Soviets) of both sides involved in the campaign.&#10;&#10;The system focuses on the different structure of the two opposing armies. Supports represent the effects of various materiel, equipment, as well as specific battle events.&#10;&#10;Players who are used to play with Liberty Roads should find Victory Roads very familiar.&#10;&#10;The main difference the game offers relies in the way to handle the Soviet player&rsquo;s offensive.

171283,,"From Wikipedia:&#10;&#10;Also known as Super-spit in Wisconsin, Spit 2 in Texas, Rush in Missouri, and Spit 3 in Kentucky,[citation needed] California Spit is a fast paced shedding card game that has the added bonus of shuffling the deck.&#10;&#10;The two players sit at opposite sides of a vertical playing surface. The dealer deals half of the cards to each player. The cards are held face down. Every round, each player plays four cards face up vertically in between both players and slightly closer to themselves. Once both players have done this, they look for two or more cards having the same number. When a player finds one, he places another card on top of the cards with that number until all of the cards with the common number are covered. In other words if there are three fours out then all three cards can get a new card on top of it. If a four is played on top of a four it is called a double, and the player may place a third card on top of it. This requires that players pay attention to the cards they are laying down on the pile. If a player runs out of cards then that player wins. When there are no more groups of cards remaining, each player scoops up the four piles directly in front of him or her and places them face down on the bottom of his or her deck. That round ends and the next begins.&#10;&#10;In some versions of the game, there is a move called &quot;spitting&quot; in which the player is allowed to spit on the other player to distract him/her. It is common that they call &quot;doubles&quot; to inform the other player what they did. ment for {21+ age} a longer period of time usually 3 hours is the min, and 4 is the max.&#10;&#10;"

If a player has a choice of location, she chooses as she wishes.&#10;&#10;If someone makes a mistake when playing a card, any opponent can shout &quot;Schlafm&uuml;tze&quot;, then all of the opponents give the top card of their deck to the player who goofed.&#10;&#10;If a player empties her draw deck, she flips over her discard stack at the start of her next turn. As soon as a player is out of cards, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;Schlafm&uuml;tze is a slightly altered remake of a traditional card game, so no designer is credited for it.&#10;&#10;"

Player with most money at game end is winner.  Game can be played in short amount of time or can be lengthy - you decide.&#10;Equipment: Game board, player pieces, sentence log, playing money, sentencing cards, appeal/parole cards and pair of dice.&#10;&#10;User Description:&#10;Roll and move game where players go along the outer track receiving money for various life events, but also are at risk of being convicted of various crimes. Cards from the &quot;Sentencing&quot; pile determine how long a player must go to jail (i.e. the inner track) or whether they have received probation. Various spaces on the inner track (each circuit around being one year) also earn you money and random card draws may win you appeals, probation, or an overturn of your conviction. Score sheets (&quot;Sentence log&quot;) allow players to keep track of all the crimes they've been convicted of and how much time they've served for each. According to the game rules, there is no set goal; players must agree on a length of time to play or an amount of money to reach first.&#10;&#10;The game is apparently intended as a criticism of the lenient &quot;revolving door&quot; of the U.S. criminal justice system, similar to &quot;Capital Punishment&quot; or &quot;Public Assistance.&quot; Although the game was made in 1995, it fails to take into account the then new but growing &quot;three strikes&quot; system in many states, as well as criminal court's tendency to impose harsher sentences on repeat offenders.&#10;&#10;"
