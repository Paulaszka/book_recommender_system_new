The dark lord Sauron is pleased that you have... chosen... to champion the true destiny of Middle-earth. Some prefer the hopeless cause of men and their miserable allies. Theirs is a fool's choice! You show no affinity for such delusions. You seek glory for Sauron, and your rewards shall be great.&#10;&#10;You are one of Sauron's most powerful minions: a Nazgul! You must work together with the other Nazgul to stop the cursed hobbits and destroy the resistance of men. But at the same time, you must strive to prove your own worth to the dark lord. After all, there are rumors that even the Witch-king can be killed, and Sauron may soon need a new leader for the Nazgul.&#10;&#10;In The Lord of the Rings: Nazgul, you are faced with three Campaigns that you must conquer before the Ringbearer carries the One Ring to Mount Doom. If you cannot complete them in time, all players lose! Along the way, you will earn Victory Points (VPs), and if the group succeeds in its duty, the player with the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;"

The design is what was originally intended but deviated from with the introduction of chess pieces in Linebreakers.&#10;&#10;Traplines, like Linebreakers, utilizes custodial trapping and delayed capture.  In this, two pieces of a player will &quot;bookend&quot; a line of enemy pieces and freeze them so they can't move, but can be captured in a future turn.  The origins of the idea came from pondering what would happen if you took Othello/Reversi and moved pieces on the board.  From this the custodial trap, with delayed capture, move came about.&#10;&#10;In the game, there are a number of starting configurations and multiple variants that involve capturing opponent's pieces or exiting one's own pieces off the board, in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;"
