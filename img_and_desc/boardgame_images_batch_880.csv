It also comes with the beginner's game Space Diamonds (accessible to bright children), Race for Glory (introductory, including a playthrough), and a variety of solitaire and cooperative variants. The iconic map of High Frontier is the most comprehensive map of the solar system ever published! Since it is a delta-v map, it offers a completely different view of the accessibility of the worlds that orbit Sol. The cards and map have been expanded and produced in consultation with experts in the field, and the author himself is a former rocket scientist, and we can safely say this is the most accurate yet accessible game of space exploration/exploitation ever published.

281682,,"The Signal experimental wargame is a three-player, turn-based strategy game designed to study decision-making concerning the use of conventional and nuclear weapons. The research objective is to explore how weapons capabilities shape player behavior and the resulting impacts on strategic stability and the potential for escalation in a crisis. The board game serves as both a source of experimental data and a testing ground for the ruleset and game dynamics that were subsequently built into the SIGNAL online platform.&#10;&#10;In SIGNAL, players choose courses of action that a hypothetical nation might follow, using economic, military, and diplomatic means. Players may choose to cooperate with or compete against the other players in the virtual world to grow their infrastructure and gain resources while avoiding loss of home territory to conventional militarized invasions or nuclear war. The game proceeds in rounds, with players maneuvering their forces within a map-based environment.&#10;&#10;Players work simultaneously, often negotiating agreements such as trade deals or military alliances, and &ldquo;signal&rdquo; to others by placing tokens on hexes (units of land or water). The signaling token is accompanied by the staging of cards (face down) that reflect actions like building cities, sending troops to neutral territories, or engaging in military operations, including the use of conventional or nuclear arms. There is a price associated with signaling; players pay for each card placed, regardless of whether the capability is exercised to reflect the &ldquo;costly signaling&rdquo; or &ldquo;credible commitments&rdquo; in the existing theoretical literature on deterrence. Players may then exercise their staged actions, but only at locations where signaling tokens were previously placed.&#10;&#10;During this action phase, players take a series of turns, starting with a randomly chosen player to ensure that any given player does not have a constant first-mover advantage. After five rounds, players are ranked on a relative scale based on their infrastructure, resources, and territorial integrity to determine the winner&mdash;with a player&rsquo;s cumulative performance captured on a leaderboard.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

In this game the Players are both: brokers and investors. The Bank sells tokens used forinvesting. As in real stock market, the idea is to buy low and sell high. The rates change every turn, eachPlayers can make one or multiplied exchanges on own turn. Dice can be used to play, but usually StockMarket is played with finger marks, that determine the rate vectors. The duration of one game can bedefined by players, e.g. 40 or 60 min. The person to make most of their capital within the agreed timebrackets is the winner.ATTENTION: Dramatic turns in the body of the game can cause stress symptoms when taken too seriously.It was our goal to make this game as real as possible following stock exchange ups and lows dramas.Anyway, this is a virtual reality only. Relax and enjoy!&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;To begin:Roll open Lite Lion Games rollable Stock market gaming mat. Place violet rate detectors to the mid-space, marked &ldquo;0&rdquo;. At least two players are recommended to be on the opposite side of eachother/other side of the table to make the finger marks drawing easier. The Players choose own colourfrom the four colours available. Each Player gets 5 pcs tokens of the corresponding colour, each ofnominal value of LL$400 of investment, and LL$2320 cash. The cash money is issued as following: 1 pcsLL$1000, 6 pcs LL$100, 9 pcs LL$50, 9 pcs LL$20 and 9 pcs LL$10. The investment tokens can beexchanged to cash in the Bank as equal to LL$400 each.The beginner can be chosen in any suitable way, as coin draw and etc. In according to the sequence ofturns, each Player has equal amount of turns per game.&#10;&#10;The Turn&#10;&#10;The Rate:For each turn two Players draw the number. The number is counted together on fingers of two Playersat once: The Player, whose turn in on and any other Player as agreed. The hand is hidden behind theback or under the table and when released, the amount 0-5 can be shown on fingers (as pictured). Thegross number on both Players&rsquo; hands valued 1-10 is the number of the share to move. It can go up or&#10;&#10;down. The violet indicator is moved one step up to down to show the quote of the particular share.The position of the palm is important: if both Players&rsquo; palm is facing down, the rate decreases, otherwisethe rate increases. If both Players shows zero, the rate of each share 1-10 decreases one level. If bothPlayers show same even number, the vector of each even number share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step.If both Players show same odd number, the vector of each odd number share (1,3,5,7,9) is moved onestep.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector.&#10;&#10;Changing the Rates with Dice:The Player of the upcoming turn throws one of dice first. Numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 increase the Rate by onestep. Numbers 1 and 2 decrease the Rate by one step. Then the Players throw two dice. The grossnumber is the number of the Share, which goes up or down. The violet Rate Indicator is moved one stepforward or back. If dice return gross number 12, all the Shares 2-11 decrease one level. If both dicereturn with same even number, the vector of each even number Share (2,4,6,8,10) is moved one step. .If both dice return with same odd number, the vector of each odd number Share (1,3,5,7,9) is movedone step.ATTENTION: Step and Level enjoy different relevancy. Step is one space on the rate indicator vector,when Level is a grade on the vertical vector. When played with dice,Shares are marked with numbers 2-11, so Share #1 equals with number11 on dice. Dice gross number 12 is equal to zero on fingers. Otherwisethe instructions are same.&#10;&#10;Quotation changes:Quotation changes after each Trade (buy/sell) event except the firstinvestment round. As the Asset is invested, the Quotation Indicator ismoved a step forward. As the Asset is released (the Shares are sold out),the quotation indicator moves a step back. The changes take place afterthe trade event is completed. The quotation always moves one stepdespite the value of the trade event. The Quotation Indicator moves asillustrated considering steps 1-7. The horizontal step does not changethe rate. When moving downwards, the Indicator moves same, but inthe opposite direction. When Rate Level changes, the Indicator goes over green or red line.&#10;&#10;Exchange:As Exchange Rate changes, the Player completes the Trade. Each Turn allows to make multiple Trades(Buy/Sell Events). The Player invests one or more Units into the chosen Enterprise. One non-recurringinvestment nominal value is $400.&#10;Investment Purchase Rate:&#10;If the Rate Indicator is in zero space (&ldquo;0&rdquo;), the Investment is in its nominal value of $400. &#10;If the RateIndicator is e.g. +20, the Investor has to pay $400+$20=$420&hellip;..&#10;If the Rate is e.g. -60, the Investment is $60 below the nominal value, so they can get a $60 refund from the Bank or buy the shares for $400-$60=$340.&#10;&#10;The Investment token is placed to the same space with the Rate Indicator.Investment Sales Rate&#239;&#129;&#182; ProfitIf the Investment Token is in e.g. in space &ldquo;0&rdquo; (zero) and Rate Indicator is in space &ldquo;+40&rdquo;, the Investmentis evaluated $400+$40. So, the Investor gets $40 profit. NOTE: When selling shares out, the investedsum is not refunded to the Bank but stays in the possession of the Investor (the Player). The Investorgets interest from the Bank $40 for each invested unit. (?)&#239;&#129;&#182; Lost&#10;If the Investment token is in space &ldquo;-20&rdquo; and the Rate is &ldquo;-60&rdquo;, the Player&rsquo;s Investment is $40 below purchase price, so when selling, the Investor has to pay $40 to the Bank for each Invested Unit. So, the Player gains a loss of $40. The Investment token returns to its nominal value of $400 after this action.Exchange commissionThe Exchange charges a commission for each assignment. Each Investment Unit placed into Shares isdue to the brokerage of $10.&#10;&#10;Rate Development&#10;Top Rate&#10;Reaching its top value, the Rate development stops. Getting a raise claim, while enjoying the top rateposition, the Rate collapse three levels down, e.g. from level +120 to level +60.&#10;Bottom Rate&#10;Reaching its bottom value, the Rate development gets out of control. Getting a reduce claim, whileenjoying the bottom rate position, the Share turns valueless and all the Investment have to be returnedto the Bank without reimbursement. This action forces the Rate back to zero level.&#10;&#10;Trades Between Investors&#10;The Players are allowed to trade Shares/Investments between each other. The trades occur accordingthe Rate levels. Reciprocal trading is not due to commissions, neither it influences the Rate. The buyerplaces their Investment token instead of the Seller&acute;s ones, and the Seller&rsquo;s tokens are returned to theBank. The Bank does not pay for the tokens as they are paid by the Buyer. The price can be also agreedin-between the parties, as in some cases singular Investor for particular Share is an advantage.&#10;&#10;The Winner&#10;The game is over when the agreed time period is full. As the Investments are liquidated, the Player who gains the biggest capital is the winner. The game is also over, if every Share&rsquo;s Rate is in its top value. Thiscondition also enforces Investments&rsquo; liquidation.DurationDuration of one game round is subject to the number of Players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Race your small spacefaring trade vessel across the galaxy cleverly plan your course of the choices routes to reach the most valuable worlds while earning travel fees along vital navigation routes. Once a player has built all their bases the game ends and winner will be the one outmaneuver their rivals with more bases on sets of planets and in the longest interconnected route.&#10;&#10;Overview of Play:&#10;Moving through or ending a turn on a planet provides one resource cube of the matching color. Each base built on a planet is worth victory points totaled at the end of the game. Different planet colors have different values and some permit special actions. Bonus points are earned for having bases on matching planet colors as well as on sets of all three colors. Additionally, special crew members granting players unique actions can be purchased by spending resource cubes at the starting home-world tile.&#10;&#10;When the final planet tile has been placed and that player has taken their final turn actions, the game immediately ends and scoring takes place. The winner will be the player who accumulated the most points from building sets of planetary bases. The longest connected route along interstellar navigation lines also scores a bonus and bases on rarer planet colors are worth more than common ones. The player who triggers the end of the game by placing their final base also earns 1 additional bonus point for doing so. When a player is down to just a single base, as a courtesy they should announce it to the other players.&#10;&#10;Players move their trade vessels between stars and planets along navigation routes carefully collecting resources along the way to spend on building planetary bases.&#10;Both ending a turn with your ship on a planet, or just passing through the planet on your travels, provides one resource cube of the matching color &mdash;either grey, red, or blue.&#10;Each base built on a planet is worth commerce points totaled at the end of the game. But beware, building where other players already have a base costs extra and just passing through a planet with another player&rsquo;s base provides them travel fees!&#10;&#10;Points are earned immediately when a base is built on a planet. Each additional base the player might later build one the planet also scores points. But a player cannot build two of their bases directly on top of one another. They can only build another base at the same planet when it will go on top of another player&rsquo;s base.&#10;Special planets &mdash;purple, yellow, orange&mdash; offer unique actions such as exchanging resources or earning extra resource cubes.

Mythos are obtained by characters via items or investigation and grant the power to banish monsters. Characters may also gain Insanity during encounters with powerful creatures (such as the shoggoth). The more Insanity a character gains, the more unstable they become.&#10;&#10;The game is playable with 3-13 players; if eliminated, players return to the game as cultists and deep ones (now playing on the Director's team against all other survivors).&#10;&#10;Terror mounts with each successive reel!
