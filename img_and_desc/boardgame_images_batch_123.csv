The puzzles are paintings of four different horses, with each in a similar setting, but in a different season.&#10;&#10;The puzzle pieces are mixed and distributed facedown, with 40 pieces to each player. Each player sets up a partition to hide his pieces. The horse pictures are mixed facedown and one is dealt to each player. Each player places his picture in the holder slots of his partition; this is the puzzle that player must assemble.&#10;&#10;To start the game, players turn over their pieces and begin assembling their puzzles. At any time and throughout the game, any player may offer to trade one to four puzzle pieces. When another player agrees to trade that number, they immediately trade those pieces facedown. At any time, a player may call out &ldquo;Hold Your Horses,&rdquo; and designate right, left, or across. All players must immediately pass one puzzle piece in the direction specified.&#10;&#10;Trading continues until one player completes his puzzle. The game may be played by three players by removing one complete puzzle before beginning.&#10;&#10;Note: This game was produced by the Springbok puzzle division of the Hallmark Card company. There is no date on either the box or the instruction sheet, so the production year is approximate. Naturally, there is no information regarding who designed the game. It was sold only through Hallmark Card dealers.&#10;&#10;"

The same distance that planes could cover in a few hours took days for ships and weeks for foot soldiers. Hostile jungles and great oceans combined to make logistics and transport of paramount historical concerns. These and other design puzzles are solvable by only the most gifted designers.&#10;&#10;Renowned Japanese wargame designer Tetsuya Nakamura has successfully met these challenges and Multi-Man Publishing is to offer the elegant result - Fire in the Sky. Fire in the Sky has, until now, only been available in Japanese.&#10;&#10;With only one map and 180 counters, Fire in the Sky packs years of prior Pacific design attempts and experience into an effort that beautifully distills the essence of the conflict and serves as further proof that great things do indeed come in small packages. Fire in the Sky provides players with the same problems and perspectives faced by the historical combatants, yet does so in a game that can be played in 5 hours or less. The game is ingeniously balanced and so provides not only a look into the minds of the actual commanders, but also a fun, competitive and tense gaming experience.&#10;&#10;The game includes glorious 1-inch counters, a clever map that integrates hexes and areas, and rules that cover all of the essential aspects of the Great Pacific War.

Players attempt to move the ball toward their opponent's goal by controlling their EEG activity, monitored through two headbands wired to a bio-sensor system; by relaxing their brains, and hence increasing their alpha and theta brainwaves, players cause the ball to roll toward the other side of the table.  The most relaxed player will win when the ball reaches their opponent's goal.&#10;&#10;"

Striker II also includes tables of organization and equipment listings for some of the most important military units from Traveller's long history: Zhondai Lift Infantry Battalions and Commando Groupments, Imperial Marine Task Forces, Imperial Guard Regiments, and the legendary 4518th Lift Infantry Regiment- &quot;The Duke of Regina's Own Huscarls.&quot;&#10;&#10;Striker II provides the full science fiction combat experience with rules on orbital bombardment, drop troops, anti-missle fire control, planetary environment, and orbital superiority.

War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.&#10;&#10;Rob Markham's Soldier Raj builds on the highly successful model of Soldier Emperor to portray these conflicts. Over a dozen scenarios cover these wars, from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces are the decadently thick tiles seen in Soldier Emperor and Granada: The Fall of Moslem Spain. Artist Terry Moore Strickland has gone well beyond those games; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are tiny works of art.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory. Soldier Raj features high-quality playing cards, and includes a new deck of these for use in Soldier Emperor when playing the two games together.&#10;&#10;Soldier Raj can also be played together with Soldier Emperor: Napoleon's Wars 1803-1815. Players can either add more seats at the table, or assign the Indian kingdoms to players with only European holdings. Britain becomes both more powerful in the combined game, and more vulnerable.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Emperor: Napoleon's Wars 1803-1815, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation's enemies.&#10;&#10;"

All but 4 cards are dealt to the players; the top card of the remaining 4 is turned up to determine trumps. One player leads to the first trick and may play any card in their hand. Succeeding players must follow these rules (in order) when playing: (1) Must play a card of the same suit that was led; (2) If player does not have the suit led, they must play a trump card; (3) If player cannot follow either rule (1) or (2), they may play any suit. In addition, once it is determined which of the three foregoing rules applies to a player, they, if possible, must play a card that has a higher numeric value than the highest-valued card already played to the trick. If they cannot play a higher card, then they may play any card that follows the applicable rule. When all players have one card left in their hands, the round ends.

There are 10 noses, all taken from art, shown paired up in every combination on large tiles (excepting one pairing because there are only 54 tiles in the game). The tiles are shuffled face-down and distributed evenly (excess can go in the box). Players then turn up and sort their noses out.&#10;&#10;They take it in turns to add a nose to the pattern according to the rules, and when a player makes or increases a group of one type of nose, they place one of their five colored markers on it. (If you happen to increase two groups, you place 2 markers.)&#10;&#10;But as soon as another player increases that group, their marker replaces the first, which goes back to the other player. In this way, the pattern gets bigger and players fight to control the noses. But because of the random distribution, you will have some fewer noses than others, so the placement becomes very tactical as you try to close off groups and secure your scoring.&#10;&#10;The pattern must sit within a 10x10 grid, and all the tiles are open, so it pays to deliberately extend the grid in one direction, giving or taking away opportunities. When no more tiles can be placed, you score one point for each nose you own.&#10;&#10;A surprisingly tricky game given the range of noses, Nasenspiel entertains with a delightful combination of sacrifice and reward and a very unusual theme.&#10;&#10;"
