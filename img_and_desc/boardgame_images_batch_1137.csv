Each side of the paper shows an area with 13 hexagons, each filled with a number, surrounded by a ring of 16 hexagons, each filled with a color. Start on whichever side you want; you use both during play.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player rolls three dice, then can re-roll any number of dice once. Each die has the numbers 1-6 with a different color on each side. After the roll, all players use these dice to mark off hexes on their sheet. For each die, you can use either the number or the color; additionally, you can sum numbers on the dice, which will be required since the numbers in the hexes go up to 12.&#10;&#10;However, once you mark a colored hexagon, you can mark only the adjacent colored hexagons from that point on. Similarly, when you first mark a number, circle that number. The next number you mark must be in an adjacent hex; draw a line that connects this number to the circle. With each subsequent number marked, you must extend the line, never crossing it or revisiting a marked space.&#10;&#10;If the active player can't use all three dice, they mark a misthrow box on their sheet; the same is true for non-active players who don't use at least two dice. When you mark all three misthrow boxes, flip your sheet, then start marking the other side on the next turn; you can also choose to flip your sheet before you get three misthrows.&#10;&#10;When any player has three misthrows on their second side, the game ends, and players tally their points for each side, summing those values. The more hexes you mark off, the better your score!&#10;&#10;"

Each player has a sufficient supply of identical stones, each with one color on the front and the other on the back.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Definitions:&#10;     A flank is a configuration where two friendly stones in a straight line (along one of the six cardinal directions) are at the same distance from a stone, with the same number of empty points (which can be zero) and no other stones in between.&#10;     To flip is to replace a stone with a stone of the opposite color.&#10;     A territory is one or more empty points flanked by friendly stones that are not flanked by enemy stones.

Each level adds new special cards, such as the mirror and a second copy of some number cards, and more cards dealt to players.

Keops is an action building game, with worker placement and resource management mechanics. The actions available at the start of the game are related to obtaining materials to build the Pyramid and defending the borders. However, as players build the city, and new temples and crops, the available actions will increase, increasing the possibilities and strategies. Each game of Keops is conditioned to what the players build, so each one will be a different experience. This, added to the different families available and the use of the Decree cards, which modify the rules of the game, make each game completely different. This is one of the strong points of Keops.&#10;&#10;The game is played over three rounds, the end of each round being determined by the level of construction of the pyramid. During a round, players will play their turns one at a time, assigning their officials to the various actions or removing them from the central board to obtain their rents and pay their salaries. Each of the buildings that have been constructed are available to all players, regardless of who built them. However, you will receive benefits every time another player makes use of one of your buildings. This is important when it comes to developing your long-term strategy, as it provides extra income, which always comes in handy. In Keops there are no victory points. To win the game you will have to win the favor of the Pharaoh Jufu. Be the player with more offerings in the temple of Ra, to obtain the favor of the priests of the Pharaoh. Build the Pyramid to earn the favor of the architects' guild of Jufu. Defend the Borders hiring Medjays to avoid the invasion of your territories and not to lose resources, workers or your own buildings. And build the city to obtain Prestige, thus gaining the Favor of the Pharaoh's court. At the end of each level of the Pyramid, players will have the opportunity to obtain these favors, but also to lose them...&#10;&#10;For the most daring, the Ra-utoma deck adds a virtual player with three levels of difficulty in games for 1 to 3 players, who will make things difficult for the Viziers. All this under the watchful eye of Jufu, who will not stop in the construction of his great tomb. Although players do not build the Pyramid, the game itself will do it little by little, so every action becomes relevant, because you never know how much time you have left to obtain the Pharaoh's favor.&#10;&#10;"

It is played on the hexes (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal board. The recommended size is 10 cells per side, where the edge cells are darker. Boards of size 6 or 14 are also valid. Each player has access to a single set of identical stones with two colors, one on the front and another on the back.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Definitions:&#10;     A snake is a maximal set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone is an egg.&#10;     The head or tail of a snake is a stone adjacent to exactly one other stone of the same snake. Each snake must have a single head and a single tail.&#10;     The length of a snake is the number of stones it contains.&#10;     To flip is to replace an enemy stone with a friendly stone.&#10;     To cut is to split an enemy snake into two or more snakes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Turns:Black plays first, and then turns alternate. On your turn, perform the following actions in a straight line, starting from exactly one friendly head, tail, or egg:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place one or more friendly stones, one by one, to grow a snake.&#10;     Flip one or more groups of consecutive enemy stones (that are not a head, tail, or egg) found along the path, in order to cut enemy snakes.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;         Each flipped group must be complete and must be followed by at least one empty cell, which you must occupy as a cut cell.&#10;         You may perform several cuts in the same turn, always in the same direction and as long as each has its own cut cell.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;You may choose to continue or stop on any cell along the path, as long as you meet the placement and, if applicable, the cut conditions. The sequence of placed or flipped stones must form a continuous path, growing from a friendly head, tail, or egg. If placing or flipping a stone merges two friendly snakes, you may not continue, unless you must occupy a cut cell to make a valid cut. Incorporating eggs to the snake does not interrupt the turn.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, no friendly stone may be on the edge unless the edge cell is a cut cell. If you cannot place stones, pass your turn; otherwise, passing is not allowed.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;End of the game:The game ends when no player can place stones. The winner is the one with the longest snake. If there is a tie, the next longest snakes are compared until there is a winner. If the tie persists, the player who placed the last stone wins.&#10;&#10;To balance the game, before starting, the first player places one white and one black stone (eggs) on empty cells. Then, the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called two-stone pie rule.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Reverse variant:The same rules apply, except the player with the fewest snakes of shortest length wins. In case of a tie, the next snake lengths are compared, and so on, until there are no more ties. Note that eggs count as snakes of shortest length.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

In each turn, they take an action by deploying one of their workers or their truck to brew an increasing variety of beers, improving the brewing process with new advancements like refrigeration machines or beer filters, or increasing the efficiency of their workers, to name but a few. Action cards also play an important role, and with beer deliveries and other actions, they can earn victory points. Actions take place on the game board and their own player tableau, the player order is important and influenced by the players, bonus workers enable additional actions but must first be earned by placing the right worker on the right action space.&#10;&#10;Beer Pioneers extends over an indefinite number of rounds.

At its core, Amabel Holland's Kaiju Table Battles is about teams of giant monsters beating the snot out of each other on a tense 5 x 4 battle grid. Dice you roll and place this turn can be spent on a later turn to unleash attacks, or to use reactions to cancel or mitigate the attacks coming in your direction. Each of your fifty-foot fighters has their own combination of attacks, reactions, movement effects, and special powers, giving them a unique role on the battlefield and in your team.&#10;&#10;While you're trying to win a match against your opponent, you're also working with them to achieve a cooperative goal that emphasizes some aspect of the game. For example, you might be trying to knock down three buildings, and the most efficient way to do that of course is to slam an enemy monster into them! Achieve the goal, and you'll get to open an envelope containing a brand new monster and a new rule that applies to all future matches. These envelopes also contain &quot;swaps&quot; &ndash; alternate attacks and powers for existing monsters, allowing you to customize your team and try out new strategies. (Each of the nine envelopes is hand-packed by the game's designer or someone important to her.)&#10;&#10;Over the course of several matches, the game itself becomes more complex, challenging, and nuanced. It's not quite a legacy game &ndash; no components are destroyed or altered, and there isn't an overarching start-to-finish narrative with plot twists. But as the game's colorful cast of characters grows, what emerges is a kind of story told along the edges &ndash; a series of meditations on monsters, identity, community, and queerness.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

This is a detective game about the adventures of Chicago Tribune staffer John Fitzpatrick, an investigative reporter, in the thick of the events taking place in Chicago in the early 1930s.&#10;&#10;At a time when the Great Depression was breaking out in the United States and Prohibition was about to be repealed and Prohibition had been in force for over a decade, the influence of gangsters was especially strong and no event in Chicago seemed to happen without their interference. Playing the role of journalist John Fitzpatrick, you have to make sense of six intricate stories, each with its own independent plot, while also being partly related to the others, its own unique set of figures and clues.&#10;&#10;Cops and gangsters, musclemen and bootleggers, civilians and the Chicago Tribune-all the people you meet along the way can provide valuable information or just deceive you.&#10;&#10;Detective experience, intuition and logic must guide you through a web of lies, innuendo and coincidence. Slipshod facts, suspicious events, cyphers and charades are the things that will help shed light on these mysteries and help unravel the most complex cases. More than 100 unique locations await you during the game. Among them, for example, the Chicago Tribune, the Boeing Aircraft Company's test centre, Imperial Restaurant, the University of Chicago, and the small town of Dixon, just a couple of hours away from Chicago.&#10;&#10;"
