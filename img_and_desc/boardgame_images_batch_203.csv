The players can take the roles of supporters of the &quot;orange&quot; opposition of Wiktor Juschtschenko, or &quot;the blues&quot; - government side of Wiktor Janukowytsch. In a 4 player game each player plays one of the 2 orange or blue factions, with players forming 2 teams.&#10;&#10;"

The players agree how many rounds they wish to play. One player takes the 10 chickens and three dice and throws them on the table. The sum of the two red dice, minus the number rolled on the blue die, is the target number. If the target number is greater than 0, the players grab the chopsticks and try to pick up as many chickens as the target number demands. The player who manages to do this first, scores that number. If the target number is less than 1, grabbing the chopsticks gives the player 1 negative point. The next round starts with the player who lost this round throwing dice and chickens.&#10;&#10;Components: 10 grilled chickens, 2 pairs of chopsticks, 2 red dice, 1 blue die&#10;&#10;"

The holes are about a quarter-inch wider than the diameter of the rods, and there are holes under the holes to keep the rods centered and vertical.  A handle with conductive, spring-loaded, plier-like pincher is wired to the base unit.  When the circuit is completed between the play field and the pincers, a loudish explosion sound goes off and a small light goes on.  The top of the rods are slightly flattened and have a piece of tape on the flat sides.&#10;&#10;The game consists of rolling a big die marked with the three colors, and then using the pliers to pull out a rod of that color without touching the edge of the play field hole, ala Operation.  The instructions instruct players to grab the rods by the edges (non-taped) of the flattened top, I suppose to ensure a solid contact between the rod and pincher.&#10;&#10;It's not that easy.  You have to watch carefully that you're pulling the rods out exactly vertical, and there's little &quot;feel&quot; using the pliers to judge the force you're using.  The circuit is very sensitive and doesn't let you get away with much.  The explosion sound was surprisingly loud the first time I tried the game, not at all like the Operation buzzer - startled the crap out of me.  Same thing apparently happened to the kid pictured on the box...  &#10;&#10;&#10;"

After each move the opposing player may or may not call BS (short for bluffing style) in that case the moving piece is revealed, and a penalty is given to moving player if they cheated or to the calling player if the move was legal.&#10;&#10;One other big change to chess is that the players pieces start in stacks along the back row of the board.

The map measures 20&quot; x 14&quot; and is in full color.  Each player could be Tarzan, Akut, Sheeta, or Numa.  Players draw upside-down tiles numbered 1, 2, 3, or 4 and then move the corresponding number of footprints along the jungle map.  The first person to reach the end of the Tarzan Trail wins the Treasure Hunt.&#10;&#10;An Australian version also exists which was produced by John Sands for the Pepsodent Toothpaste company as a free promotional game  in 1933&#10;&#10;"

The show was basically a simple computer (arcade) game, hosted and broadcast live, where callers maneuvered Hugo using the number keypads of their landline telephones. The game uses keypad-styled cards with numbers 1-9 to emulate this mechanic. Using these cards, four spinners and a d3, players move around the board gathering sacks of gold, with the ultimate goal of releasing Hugo's wife Hugolina and their kids who have been imprisoned by an evil witch.&#10;&#10;"

It is divided into twelve equal segments, each with a hole near the circumference.  A small ball on a string is attached to the center of the board.  The board has been designed with incomplete joins between each of the twelve sectors so that it is possible to flip the ball upwards by pressing down on the edge of any particular segment.&#10;&#10;Players select an equal area of the board to patrol.  If the ball is flipped into an opponent's hole, the player who achieved this is awarded a point.  Each segment has three rows of holes for colored scoring pegs; a peg is placed in the top row of each segment at the start of the game.  When a point is scored, any one peg from the relevant player's segments is moved down one row.&#10;&#10;The first player to move all their score pegs from the top to the bottom row wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The premise behind the game is that goblins are real, humans drove them away from Earth a long time ago, and now that humans are space-faring, they discover that the goblins have the same technology and are out for revenge!&#10;&#10;The game map depicts a human Federation Star Explorer spaceship which has been rammed and boarded by a goblin War Cruiser, part of which is also depicted on the mapsheet. The ships are divided into corridors and compartments. The counters represent individual combatants. There is no grid, movement is simply conducted room to room. The rules incorporate miniatures-style concepts for units to obstruct movement and line-of-sight. Given the bloodthirsty nature of goblins on the edge of going berzerk, the two forces fight until one side is eliminated.&#10;&#10;While the game system is fairly straightforward, there are a number of interesting elements (for example, there is no stacking of counters -- instead, the rules allow for as many counters as can fit into a room on the map without overlapping). There are also a number of special unit types, such as Witch Doctors for the goblins (who can bring the dead back to life), Robots for the humans, and Technicians for both sides. The latter have various skills, including creating and removing barriers, unjamming weapons, etc.&#10;&#10;"
