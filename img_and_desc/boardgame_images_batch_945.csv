If the other players successfully guess which option you chose, your action succeeds and the story progresses.&#10;&#10;Because of its modular symbol interpretation system, you can use Inventures to play stories in any setting imaginable: Westerns, SciFi, Fantasy, or a game set in the world of your favorite books or movies!&#10;&#10;Games can be as short as 45 minutes and as long as weeklong campaigns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Every single play will be different.&#10;     All Superheroes start at the Start Block; Goobi, the villain is placed at the center circle of the board, his Sewer.&#10;     Players spin to determine whether to move a Superhero or Goobi. Dice roll determines the number of steps to advance forward or the sewer number to emerge from. &#10;     If the spinner stops at either of the Superhero quadrants, the player may choose ANY Superhero game piece to move.&#10;     Whichever city block the Villain lands on, flip over the City Block to RED. &#10;     When Superhero lands on a RED City Block, player must draw a City Watch&trade; Scenario Card to assess the situation by using the Feeling Cards and the Thoughts-Feelings-Actions prompt.&#10;     After solving the scenario, the RED City Block can be turned back to normal - GRAY.&#10;     If a Superhero lands on a Power Block, the player must draw a Power-Up&trade; Card and discuss the question on the card. After discussion, player keeps the Power-Up&trade; Card to: &#10;&#10;&#10;        1) Send Goobi back to Sewer, &#10;        2) Select to turn over any RED City Block back to Gray, or &#10;        3) Make Goobi stay in the sewer at its turn.&#10;&#10;     If Goobi lands on a power block, it immediately goes back to its sewer.&#10;     If BOTH superhero and Goobi lands on the same block: &#10;&#10;&#10;1) Superhero is thrown into the sewer, &#10;        2) The block turns RED, and &#10;        3) The rest of the super squad must use the Feelings Card deck (roll dice to determine how many feelings to select randomly) to act out. After the rescue, player rolls dice to determine which sewer hole the Superhero may emerge from.&#10;&#10;To Win The Game:&#10;&#10;     Strategize with the entire team of Super Squad to turn most, if not all, RED City Blocks back to Gray.&#10;     All members of the Super Squad must pass the predetermined round (Start Block) to complete the mission.&#10;     Keep the Villain in his sewer to cause the least damage to the City Blocks.&#10;     Collect as many Power-Up Cards as you can to keep the Villain in his sewer and/or turn the Red city block back to gray.&#10;     Identify as many Emotions as you can with each City Watch&trade; patrol.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
