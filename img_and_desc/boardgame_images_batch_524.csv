This sharpshooting dynamic is the source of the game's strategic interest.&#10;&#10;"

In the middle there is a large central tile connecting four paths of six lily leaves. Each of the paths is closed by a larger starting area where a player places six pieces of his colour.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to hop through the water lilies and get all of your frogs to you opponents&rsquo; lily pads. On one leaf there can be multiple pawns of the same player. Another player can only put his pawn on a leaf when there is only one pawn of an opponent. In that case the pawn of the opponent has to start over from his starting tile.&#10;&#10;The game is stored in a handy storage case with a handle.&#10;&#10;

Each turn 2 random characters are discarded and then the players secretly choose the Player Character they will play in the current turn.&#10;&#10;Each Player Character has 2 unique abilities. The first ability may be used on any turn, however the second ability may only be used in Chapters that the Player Character appears in the book.&#10;&#10;Secondly, we have the Story Decks which are composed of: Characters, Quotations, and Objects from the book. There are Story Decks for all 12 chapters of the book. Each card may be played for its cost in the Chapter it appears in. Character and Object cards have a Story Point value that adds to a Player's score. Quotation cards are used to complete a Chapter, which is accomplished by playing 3 cards in the appropriate Chapter, but have no Story Point value. Completed Chapters double the points scored while incomplete Chapters score only the card's combined Story Point value.&#10;&#10;You may have noticed that I mentioned the cost of playing a card. In Alice: Adventures in Wonderland the currency we use is Tarts. One of the actions a player may take on their turn is taking Tarts. The Tarts are  used to play Story cards. Player's must carefully balance the number of Tarts they have in their possession, because at the end of the game any Tarts they have will count against their final score. They lose 1 Story Point for every Tart they did not return to the tray.&#10;&#10;The game board we use in the game is called the Storyboard. Alice travels along a pathway from one chapter to the next, spending only a few turns in most chapters. When Alice moves into a new chapter, cards that players may have in their hands from a previous chapter may no longer be played.&#10;&#10;Along the perimeter of the Storyboard is a Story Point Tracker. At the end of each Chapter, players score the cards they played (doubled if they played 3 cards) and all cards from the Chapter (in their hands, played in front of them, or remaining in the chapter's Story Deck) are removed from the game. There is also a Tart Tracker that represents the current number of Tarts each player has in their possession.&#10;&#10;In the game, Alice is not a Player Character. She is not even a character in the Story Deck. In the game she is represented by a token that moves along a pathway through each chapter. She is a basically a timer. When the Alice token reaches the final space,  the game is over.&#10;&#10;"

Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities.

With each new turn, the players (the crew) decide together if they will rest or traverse their current location.&#10;&#10;If the crew rests, they may perform skills, such as searching for items, foraging for rations or simply resting and recovering lost fortitude.&#10;&#10;If the crew traverses, they must each spend fortitude points to do so and then draw cards from the island deck until they reveal a new location card, at which tine the turn ends.&#10;&#10;While drawing cards, the crew will encounter hazards from lava bursts to mischievous monkeys and possibly even pirate hunters. When hunters are encountered, the crew will do battle. Battle is a series of dice rolls used to do damage and deplete each side of its fortitude.&#10;&#10;The goal is to reach the end of the progress track (crossing the island) and hold a final showdown with the villainous dog who stole you ship and left you stranded on Terror Island.&#10;&#10;"

It brings infantry combat in the Star Fleet Universe to life in a way that allows ground battles to be fought simultaneously with the space battles portrayed by Star Fleet Battles, Federation Commander, Starmada, or A Call to Arms SF.&#10;&#10;Over 500 unit counters portray squads of five Marines, snipers, engineers, commandos, and heavy weapons; or individual tanks and vehicles; or special game markers.&#10;&#10;The very simple &ldquo;shoot then move&rdquo; system reflects the savage horror of war at bayonet point. Fast interaction is created by rules for opportunity fire and defensive snapshots, so both players are constantly acting, reacting, planning, and making hard decisions. Do you fire at those Klingon troops attacking your right flank &mdash; or hold the fire of your weapons for the main attack that has yet to appear (and might never)?&#10;&#10;The full-color highly artistic map portrays the terrain on a typical planet far, far away, but rules allow you to designate the colored areas as crops, forest, swamps, marshes, or any of a dozen other types of alien landscape. The map even includes an active volcano and a river of lava!&#10;&#10;Each counter is a group of five Marines (i.e., a &quot;Boarding Party&quot; from SFB or a &quot;Marine squad&quot; from FC, facilitating interactions) or a single vehicle (tank, ground combat vehicle, shuttle, or whatever). Each hex is 100 meters. While you can stack a lot of units in one hex (more infantry than vehicles, but still a lot), only a few can fire out of that hex in each direction.&#10;&#10;The game system is one of player turns. On your turn, each of your units can either shoot or move, not both. Shooting comes first (after which the unit is turned upside down so that you remember not to move it), then movement, then you turn all of your upside down units right side up. When you shoot at an enemy unit, you cross-index the kind of unit that is shooting with the kind of unit being shot at, adjust this for any terrain that provides protection, and roll one die. The enemy unit might be destroyed, stunned (turned upside down so it won't be able to shoot or move on its next turn), or unharmed.&#10;&#10;The first game module, SFM: Assault!, includes Marines, other infantry (commando, heavy weapons, engineers, Prime Teams, militia), and vehicles (tanks, trucks, engineer vehicles, command vehicles, and various light-armored troop carriers).&#10;&#10;Units will be able to dig in, call for regular artillery or transporter artillery, do assault landings with shuttles or transporters, do close assaults, use opportunity fire to shoot during the enemy turn, and conduct air strikes with fighters or gunboats.&#10;&#10;"

124473,,"Marbles? merges the exciting aspects of a party game with one-on-one challenges both observed and judged by all other players, the Peanut Gallery. Many of the challenges are reminiscent of familiar games. Others are very unique and designed specifically for the roles of Challenger, Opponent and Peanut Gallery. Marble-like gems are the currency. Players must use their intellectual marbles to win challenges and also strategically pose challenges that are to their greatest advantage. Highly dimensional, there are multiple perspectives of strategy.&#10;&#10;Players take turns being the Challenger and can select any player not previously an Opponent in the same round. &quot;Teaser&quot; cards indicate Opponent availability. Opponent cards change the dynamics of the challenge. Peanut Gallery cards permit side wagers, further expanding the dimensions of how the game is played.&#10;&#10;All challenges are performed in (2) minutes or less. Challenger cards detail a wide variety of tasks across (7) categories:&#10;1) Consensus - The Peanut Gallery is polled to derive a count that the opponent must accurately predict. Some are factual events like visiting an ATM within the last 24 hours while others are preferences such as: Cat or Dog, Chocolate or Vanilla, Paper or Plastic&hellip;&#10;2) Dice - Challenger cards in this category require a specified outcome from the roll of dice. Luck over skill, the tasks vary as defined for each challenge.&#10;3) Domino &ndash; To win, the Opponent must also hold a Challenger card in this category having a Domino number that matches one of the two numbers presented by the Challenger.&#10;4) Performance &ndash; Opponent must skillfully complete the challenge. Examples include telling a joke that invokes laughter and an impersonation in which the Peanut Gallery must correctly guess.&#10;5) Physical &ndash; Another skill category, the Opponent must successfully complete a task involving an activity like Origami (paper folding) or Roshambo (Rock-Paper-Scissors).  When the results are subjective, the Peanut Gallery judges the task.&#10;6) Playing Cards &ndash; A single hand of a common card game is played, such as Blackjack or Draw Poker. Every Challenger card in this category fully defines the task and specifies the requirements necessary to win.&#10;7) Starter &ndash; Cards in this category quickly establish the winner, simply with who holds the highest number.&#10;&#10;The objective is simple. Take turns matching a Challenger card in hand with an opponent anticipated least likely to successfully complete the task. Opponents set the wager, either (1) or (2) marbles, upon the Challenger announcing the category. Should the Opponent fail the task, the Challenger wins the wager. Otherwise, the Opponent collects the wager.  Number of players determines the number of rounds. At game end after the final showdown (in case of a tie, if necessary), the player with the most marbles reigns supreme.&#10;&#10;Not at all the game of marbles everyone played as a child, this version is all grown up but still retains the youthful retro spirit.&#10;&quot;Wanna play Marbles?&quot;&#10;&#10;180 Marbles? Cards, 4 Color-Coded Types, 7 Challenger Categories&#10;&#10;"
