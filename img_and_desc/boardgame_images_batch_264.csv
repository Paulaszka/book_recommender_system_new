The dealer turns a card to determine a penalty suit. If Krazy Kat, Ignatz Mouse or Offissa Pup are turned up, the dealer may choose the suit before he looks at his cards or he just turns the next card to determine the suit.  After all the tricks are taken, each player puts one coin in the pot for each penalty suit card taken. If  any players take no penalty suit cards then they win the pot.&#10;&#10;"

In this game, players take the role of these settlers, developing the plots of land and establishing farms in America&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heartland.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;The game, entitled &ldquo;Eine Frage der &Auml;hre&rdquo; in German, is a three-dimensional tile-laying game.

In addition, there is a race to the top of each barnyard point track in order to acquire the most valuable animals for the farm. Players may also &ldquo;rotate crops&rdquo; by using their tiles to cover up fields that bring their opponent&rsquo;s points, possibly expanding their own farms in the process. This translates into an hour-long game aimed at families and gamers with multiple paths to victory. &#10; Source: Jeffrey D. Allers&#10;&#10;"

The term &quot;kosmisch&quot; means &quot;cosmic&quot;; &quot;Hanse&quot; refers to the Hanseatic League, a Medieval trade network in Northern Europe. In the american translation of the book series the phrase &quot;Die Kosmische Hanse&quot; was translated as &quot;The Cosmic House&quot;.&#10;&#10;In this game the players take on the roles of traders who transport goods between planets.

The goods cards are double-sided; randomize them, then place several on each planet grouped by type (but no more than 2/type/planet to start). Each has their own deck, shuffled; draw 5 card hand. The cards are mostly tech cards, which can give you ongoing power; or single-use cards (counter opponent's card by playing matching card yourself). Each player begins with one card in play. This card gives each player one container and one replenishment. One player decides whether to go first or choose on which planet both planets will start. The other player gets the other option.&#10;&#10;On one's turn a player may do these actions in any order:&#10;- Flight&#10;- Two Interventions (play cards that don't have the &infin; on them)&#10;- Take two Planetary Actions (load, unload, or buy an &infin; card)&#10;&#10;When a player unloads, the delivered cards are flipped over; any resulting matches are removed from game, slowly reducing the available loads and potentially ending the game!

The trivia questions are religious in nature and are asked and answered in a mechanism simulating a simple baseball game. The key to the game is the question and answer booklet, which includes two pages of rules and 53 pages of questions. Each page has six numbered questions and answers. There is a cardboard field inset in the box and plastic pegs to use as runners.&#10;&#10;For each &quot;at bat&quot;, the batting player rolls a D6. For the first batter, the &quot;pitcher&quot; on the opposing team reads that numbered question from page 1. If the player answers correctly, he receives the result designated for that question. If he answers incorrectly, he is out. Pegs are placed on the field and advanced accordingly. One roll on each page provides a result without a question.&#10;&#10;With each succeeding batter, the question moves to the next page of the booklet, allowing a long game before any possibility of a repeated question arises. As per normal baseball rules, three outs ends an inning and the team with most runs scored after nine innings wins. The game seems to expect high scores: there are holes in the scoreboxes for 24 runs by each team.&#10;&#10;Many of the questions are very basic: &quot;Who was the real father of Jesus?&quot; (God). Others require more detailed knowledge of the Mormon church: &quot;Name the brother of Joseph Smith whose name begins with the letter H who was one of the Eight Witnesses&quot; (Hyrum), or &quot;Which of the following is not an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood: Elder, Seventy, Teacher, or High Priest?&quot; (Teacher).&#10;&#10;"

The players supply the figures at any desired scale.  The hallmark of these rules is the highly detailed and historically meticulous system for portraying the various types of military organization during this period.  Units consist of variable numbers of figures and constitute infantry battalions, cavalry regiment and artillery batteries.&#10;&#10;Despite its deliberately &quot;Old School&quot; design (i.e., large-sized units, figure removal, historically accurate rules on movement and changes of facing), the rules use modern mechanics and so do not require the writing of orders.  Existing miniature armies need not be re-based to use this rules set.  The rules book is self-published but has been produced to a high standard of quality.&#10;&#10;*  72 pages including the color cover&#10;    * Quick Ref. Charts for large/small games, miniatures and/or tables.&#10;    * If you know the 18th Century, you can play right away with just the Quick Reference Charts.&#10;&#10;"

They strive for simplicity while providing a feeling for the nature of battle during this time.&#10;&#10;The rules are tuned to enable simulation of smaller scale actions rather than the large-scale battles that are more commonly the focus of miniatures rules but were more infrequent than the types of actions (raids, ambushes, assaults and patrols) these rules are suitable for.&#10;&#10;Given this scale of focus, the rules are designed for play with 25mm figures but may be easily re-scaled for 15mm.  Rather than offer army lists as such, these rules instead provide lists of characteristics of various unit types (e.g., gendarmes, landsknechts, various nationalities of shot and pike) by period:  Tudor Wars, Italian Wars, Thirty Years War, English Civil Wars, and Louis XIV.  Along with these lists, there is a system for generating armies based on unit cost.  A representative scenario is provided for each of the five periods of the lists.&#10;&#10;"

The designer has also been a consultant on several recent board games on samurai warfare and renaissance era Japan.&#10;&#10;The rules support two different scales of battle.  In the small scale a base of figures represent 120-150 foot or 60-75 horse.  The larger scale enables simulation of the biggest battle of the era.  Each base represents 240-300 infantry or 120-150 cavalry.&#10;&#10;The rules cover all the unit types of the era including Ronin and Warrior Monks.  Further, the author includes nearly two dozen classical Japanese army deployment patterns.  Besides the rules, the booklet contains extensive lists of leaders and their ratings as well as army lists, ten historical battle scenarios and a scenario generator.&#10;&#10;"
