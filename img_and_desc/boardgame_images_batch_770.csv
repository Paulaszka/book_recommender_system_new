Use voting chips and cobbling chips to earn extra points to help you around the board and be the first to reach The famous Rovers Return.&#10;&#10;Start the game by deciding if you will play as individuals or in teams and then choose a character mover and place them on the Start space. Each player or team is then given a True or False voting chip and three cobble chips.&#10;Taking it in turn to be the Question Reader, they must pick up a card from the deck in the centre of the board and read out the question. Opponents then need to decide whether the trivia question is true or false and lay their voting chip up the correct way to answer the question. Once all voting chips have been paid down, cobbling can begin.&#10;Cobbling gives players the chance to pick up bonus points to help them move further around the board based on an opponent's true or false answer to the question. If the opponent's answer that you 'bet' your cobble chip on is correct then you get to keep your cobble chip and gain an extra point. But if their answer to the question was wrong and you chose to cobble, then you lose that chip.&#10;Once players complete a full lap of the board and move past the Start space on the board, they can collect a 30 points token. If you pass Start twice, then flip the token over to reveal 60 points.&#10;After the last True or False card is played and all players have moved their character mover the amount of spaces they've earned, the player with the highest score (most 30/60 token points plus the score on the board) is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA stack is a set of one or more pieces piled onto each other on the same point. The color of a stack is the color of its topmost piece, which denotes its owner. The height of a stack is the number of pieces in it.&#10;&#10;A crosscut is a 2x2 area containing two diagonally adjacent black stacks and two diagonally adjacent white stacks.&#10;&#10;Two like-colored stacks are considered connected in the following cases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     They are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to each other and not part of the same crosscut.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     They are both part of the same crosscut and higher than the lower enemy stack in that crosscut.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of these actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Place a piece of your color on an empty point.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move the topmost piece of a stack of your color onto an orthogonally adjacent enemy stack, provided that, before the move, the heights of both stacks are the same. Then, place a piece of your opponent's color onto the stack from which you just moved your piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;You win if, at the start of your turn, there is a chain of connected stacks of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. You lose if, at the start of your turn, your opponent has such a chain and you have no moves available.&#10;&#10;To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesFor a variant, allow piece movement only between stacks that belong to the same crosscut, or start the game with the board fully covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the two possible checkered setups may be used.&#10;&#10;Escabel was inspired by Matteo Perlini's Consta.&#10;&#10;"

Swiftly place dice to secure treasure cards. Then replace your dice with action cards to attack the other players. Then collect treasure if your cards survive the attacks.&#10;&#10;The playing area is a grid of treasure cards and a bell in the centre. The bell is rung, and each player rolls and rerolls their own six dice entirely at will, trying to make combos to place on treasure cards. As soon as there are any three pairs in any line, any player may ring the bell to force a stop (and becomes the start player). It helps to secure treasure cards in sections; if you succeed, you collect all treasures you have linked up.&#10;&#10;Each player has nine cards, numbered 0 to 5 (four 5 cards each). Each card attacks neighbouring locations in different directions, except the 0 card which is a shield, and the 5 cards on which you are becalmed. Depending on which locations you grabbed, you take turns placing cards face down, taking back your dice. The actions are revealed and resolved, going from 0 to 5 (tied numbers are won closest to the start player).&#10;&#10;Here the tactical element appears. The cards 1 to 4 attack each other in set patterns, and in rank order from low to high. Since you cannot pick up cards spent in previous rounds until you clear your hand, you must choose carefully which cards you place where. If you think a spot is safe from any attack, you can safely spend a 5 card and help clear your hand.&#10;&#10;If you think a spot is certain to be attacked, place your 0 and it survives. If you have claimed places on straight lines, you'll collect all the empty treasure cards lying between them, so often you want to be secure. If you know what cards the others have spent, you might get your attack in first with a low numbered attack.&#10;&#10;After a couple of rounds, the tactical choices become very clear and frustrating. Using the wrong action cards is a costly waste. Failing to get dice down means you get fewer chances to collect treasure and it takes longer to clear your hand and pick up your discard.&#10;&#10;Once the action cards have been resolved, any left standing take the treasure cards below them or linked in straight lines, and the action cards go to a personal discard face-down. Empty treasure spots are refilled, and the bell is rung! The game ends when there is not enough treasure on the table. At the finish, most treasure cards wins.&#10;&#10;The game is fast and the theme fits the game play. The game is language free. The second edition simply revised the artwork on the box and cards to a more cartoon/manga style and added a strategic variant. Otherwise, components and gameplay are identical between the first and second editions.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Roll the dice to your heart&rsquo;s content! Ring up a storm with the bells! Speed and strategies are both important for this analog game, which offers real-time domination + mind games, appealing to all 5 senses.&#10;&#10;Secure territories pre-emptively by placing a pair of dice on the treasure cards as fast as possible, then take time to think about how to protect the territories with attack cards, so that other players cannot foil your plans.&#10;&#10;If you are successful in holding your territory on the treasure cards, then SUCCESS! The treasure cards are rewarded to you and the process is repeated again. In the end, the player with the most treasure cards wins.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#233;&#179;&#180;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#161;&#230;&#150;&#185;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#228;&#186;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&times;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#148;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#239;&#188;&#159;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#151;&#169;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#178;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#187;&#174;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#228;&#191;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#190;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#128;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#230;&#148;&#187;&#230;&#146;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#130;&#170;&#233;&#173;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#174;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#153;&#163;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;GET&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#230;&#181;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#185;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#232;&#191;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Players manage a hand of cards to secure transportation, prospect land, and take a shot at winning a title to more land at the poker table. Cards have three uses, each corresponding to a particular phase of the game: to prospect land tiles and discover how much gold a claim will produce, to collect and play cards that build a good poker hand, and to purchase additional cards in auction to help with prospecting, poker, or both.&#10;&#10;Prospecting land is a risky business. Players must choose their cards carefully, as they have limited chances to discover the most bountiful sources of gold.  Each time they play a card and peek at a land tile, they must decide if they will stake a claim, placing their prospector&rsquo;s tent, or if they will press their luck and try to find a better claim.  But if a new land tile that they peek at produces less gold than their most previous inspected tile, the player&rsquo;s luck has run out, and they are forced to accept the less bountiful claim.&#10;&#10;In the California Gold Rush, fortunes were won and lost at the poker table.  At the end of each round, players must select two of the cards they played for prospecting and add them to the stud poker hand in front of them on the table.  At the end of the game, players reveal their poker hands.  The player with the best poker hand wins another claim, placing their fourth and final prospector&rsquo;s tent on a land tile.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, all hidden values  are revealed and players add up the gold of their various claims.  The player with the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

One player represents the Alien Leader whilst the other is the Top Cow.&#10;&#10;The goal of the Alien Leader is to abduct enough cows of sufficient quality to complete the experiments necessary to ensure success in the upcoming invasion before the space-time fold device runs out of power and transports them back to Dimension Aleph-Zootie. The goal of the Top Cow is to prevent as many cow abductions as possible.&#10;&#10;To start 20 cows from the cow deck are laid out face down in front of the Top Cow and a cow marker placed on top of them.  The 20 cow pawns (each matched to one of the cow markers) are placed on 20 of the 160 spaces on the playing board &ndash; which represents a pasture.  The Alien Leader&rsquo;s flying saucer token and 3 x alien pawns are placed, together, on any other vacant space.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, the alien and the cow player each roll two dice.  There are four phases in each round - Cow Cards, Alien Research, Alien Activity, and Cow Movement.  The Alien Leader gets to allocate one of the dice he rolled to one of those four phases, then the Top Cow gets to allocate the dice he rolled to two phases that have no dice. By default, the Alien Leader&rsquo;s last die gets assigned to the last phase without a die.&#10;&#10;Cow Cards Phase:&#10;If you&rsquo;re the Top Cow: Draw cards from the Cow Deck equal to the number on the die assigned to the Cow Cards Phase.  Look at the cards you drew.  Put each card face-down under a cow marker in front of you.  No cow may have two cards more than the cow with the least cards on the field.&#10;&#10;Alien Research:&#10;If you&rsquo;re the Alien Leader you get research points equal to the number on the Alien Research die.  You may spend a research point to look at the letter on the bottom of any cow in the field or look at one face-down cow card that&rsquo;s attached to a cow.  You may spend any number of points to look at that many cards on the top of the Cow Cards deck and put them back on top of the deck in any order.&#10;&#10;Alien Activity Phase&#10;If You&rsquo;re the Alien Leader the number on the Alien Activity die indicates how many aliens you can command this round and how many actions your alien(s) can take.  When an alien acts, it can take the following actions: Move, Recover, Abduct, Fly Saucer, Repair Saucer.  The main aim of this phase is for the Alien Leader to manoeuvre pieces around the board with the intent of abducting cows.&#10;&#10;Cow Movement:&#10;If you&rsquo;re the Top Cow you get movement points equal to the number on the Cow Movement die.

Draw Phase.  &#10;Draw 2 cards from the top of the deck and put them in your hand.&#10;&#10;2.  Action Phase.  &#10;You may play (discard) exactly one card from your hand.

Are the prequels? The spin-offs? The Christmas or other holiday special? The animated series? The musical episode? Fan fiction? The special edition or director's cut? Those questions have been turned into a game that's fun to play.&#10;&#10;The goal is to work collaboratively and competitively to get your own personal canon of up to seven cards to match the central canon, which everyone creates together, as closely as possible.&#10;&#10;Each person begins with a hand of five cards. There is a draw pile face down, seven spaces in the center for the collaboratively-determined canon (to and from which any player may place or take cards), seven spaces in front of you for your own canon, and a spot for a discard pile where cards are placed face up. The draw pile and discard pile should be oriented the opposite way from the seven canon slots, so that they are not confused with one another.&#10;You can place a card from your hand onto an identical card either in the central canon or your own personal canon.&#10;&#10;The game ends when only one player has cards remaining, and makes one final move. Any additional cards that player has then go on the discard pile.&#10;&#10;One&rsquo;s score at the end of play is determined by:&#10;1) Multiplying each card in one&rsquo;s personal canon by each matching card in the central canon, and&#10;2) Subtracting one point for each individual card in one&rsquo;s own canon that does not have an equivalent in the central canon.&#10;&#10;Note that there is no penalty related to cards still in your hand if you are the last player holding cards. These are simply discarded. Only what is in your canon determines your score.&#10;&#10;"

It is, however, your job to keep them apart - to avoid brawling bulls and potential injury (to themselves or anyone else for that matter).&#10;&nbsp;&#10;This is my take on a 'roll and write' game.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;A number of bulls are randomly placed in a field.&#10;You build fences (draw straight lines) across the field in order to enclose and separate the bulls in it.&#10;Possible starting and finishing points (fence posts) are chosen from the dice you roll.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;As well as working out where best to build your fence, you'll also need to think ahead and plan for the next ones.There is also an element of push your luck - do you risk losing a life (mallet) by going for that final fence to complete the Field or move on to the next Field and score less points?&#10;&#10;The game features 4 fields of increasing difficulty.&#10;&#10;There's just 1 page to print out and 1 page of rules.&#10;There's also a low ink (black) version available.&#10;You'll also need 3 regular dice, a pen or pencil and something to draw a straight line with.&#10;&#10;Raging Bulls was an entry for the 2017 Solitaire PnP Design Contest&#10;&#10;"

Then 4 dice cards (from a stack) are layed open to fulfill, these cards show several combinations you must make (like a number, a pair, 3 of a kind and so on). &#10;On a player's turn you first take the cards with your dices on them from the previous turn, which give you victory points at the end of the game. Then you may roll your dices up to three times (all or some) to try to make any combinations shown on the dice cards. If you achieve doing this you place your dices on the card.&#10;If you have a better combination than a previous player you may return these dices to the owner and replace them with your own. In case of a tie both players roll one dice for the victory. The game ends when a player has collected 10 dice cards. &#10;Also included is one extra roll card which has the same principle as a chance card (just count the numbers on the dices rolled). When winning this card you may roll your dices 4 times on your next turn and return the card back next to the 4 dice cards.&#10;&#10;You can play the game with or without bonus cards, if with you draw 4 bonus cards which give bonus points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"
