This time they take the gaming action to the African Front, from the start of Operation Compass on 8 December 1940, through 1942 to the eviction of the Axis from Libya.&#10;&#10;Building on the notion of a card assisted game and death-or-glory victory conditions, No Retreat: The North African Front offers a narrative game rich in the feel for the ebb-and-flow of the campaign, wrapped around an exciting maneuver and combat system that harkens back to the glory days of classic wargaming, but includes all the modern features and plenty of innovations. Unlike other North Africa wargames, there are 5 &quot;mini-maps&quot; located at the various termini of maneuver in the campaign, and where battles are waged as fascinating &quot;mini-games&quot; in their own right. Players try to sweep each map and force the action onto the next one in an effort to push their opponent out of the game.&#10;&#10;This Deluxe Edition combines both the original game, featuring Five quick-playing scenarios, a Tournament Game, a Full-Fledged Campaign game, and a Bonus &quot;Invasion of Crete&quot; mini-game, all using deluxe components of &quot;Twillight Struggle Deluxe Edition&quot; quality.&#10;&#10;The looming Malta factor is accounted for most assiduously. While abstracted into many aspects of the game, players must always be mindful of Malta being made active (helping the Allies) or inactive (assisting the Axis). The Italian forces have their rightful place in the story unfolding on the game board, and the remarkable paucity of units turns every counter and hex into the kind of wargaming puzzle reminiscent of the glory days of those great contests from the Avalon Hill General magazine.&#10;&#10;The use of Supply Point markers, received in a fast, hassle-free way, to seize the initiative, replace losses and recover shattered formations, to light up a map and begin operations there (i.e., conduct player turns on it of maneuver and combat), and then to continue those player turns for another round. Each additional round of player turns must be paid for by another Supply Point, usually spent by the side that feels it is advantageous to press on and keep the opponent hard pressed, recreating simply and effectively the lulls and starts in battlefield operations that were a signature of this campaign.&#10;&#10;The desert lies before you and World War II is at stake. You must endure and prevail under the most surprising and grueling of circumstances, for there is No Retreat!&#10;&#10;Bonus Game&#10;&#10;No Retreat: The Invasion of Crete&#10;This Bonus mini-game will allow you to refight the first airborne invasion in history, during May 1941. Each player will fight to gain or maintain control of the Island's critical 3 airfields. Time is of the essence here as each contestant has to manage his limited ressources in a life-or-death contest where neither has space to Retreat! This is a very intense knife-fight that can be very well be decided in the few first days, while the German Airborne force is most vulnerable, or could turn into a desperate rear-guard action, as the hard-pressed Allied troops try to escape the island. An innovative pre-game set-up planning procedure, and Airborne Landing rules, will insure that no two games play the same.&#10;&#10;Scenario Listing:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Compass, 1940: The British surprise offensive against the unprepared Italians in Lybia, pushing them back over 300 miles and capturing 115,000 prisoners!  This scenario makes an excellent tutorial due to its low unit density. It is essentially a race game, with the Allies rushing to reach Map 2 and win the game there.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Sunflower, 1941: Rommel arrives in Africa with the 21st Panzer Division and begins operations to roll back the recent Allied advances, thanks to the withdrawal of their best troops to fight in Greece. Can you capture the important Port/Fortress of Tobruk, or will you to be stopped by the tenacious Australians?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Crusader, 1941: The importance of Tobruk and pressure from Malta on the Axis convoy routes to Africa caused both sides to fully commit to winning the war in the western desert during the British all-out attack to relieve the siege of the embattled Fortress. It's a wild free-for all battle, where speed of manoeuvre is all-important.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Venezia, 1942: After capturing Tobruk in this operation and routing the Allied forces in the desert (and the cancellation of the Malta Invasion), the German High Command sends resources to help Rommel&rsquo;s exhausted forces race to Egypt. Can the forces of the Commonwealth hold the line at El-Alamein, or will the Afrika Corps reach Alexandria and the Suez Canal?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Operation Lightfoot 1942: The last-ditch defence of Egypt and the resulting stalemate at El Alamein was finally turned to victory for the Allies as Monty&rsquo;s overwhelming force pushed back the depleted and badly-supplied Axis Divisions. Or maybe Rommel will be able again to outmanoeuvre the British foe, and turn this battle of attrition into another of his famous victories? &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     A Tournament Scenario 1941: For players that have time to play more than a scenario, but not enough for the full-fledged campaign game.  Action starts with the first Rommel Attack of Operation Sunflower, and continues until Operation Crusader the end of 1941. Can the British keep Tobruk and Beghazi, or will the scenario end in an historical stalemate around Gazala? &#10;&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;     One 22x18 Mapboard &amp; two 11x18 Mapboards (all mounted and two-sided)&#10;     One sheet of 88, 2-sided square units - One sheet of 56, 2-sided round markers.&#10;     One rule book (24 pages)&#10;     One Scenario Book (24 pages)&#10;     55 Event Cards (36 for NR2!, 19 for Crete)&#10;     Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;&#10;Number of Players: 2&#10;Ages: 14 and up&#10;Playing Time: approximately 50 minutes for each scenario; 4 to 5 hours for a campaign game; 60 to 90 minutes tor the Crete mini-game.&#10;Scale NR2: German &amp; Allied units are Divisions (8-10,000 men), Italian units are Corps of binary (2 Regiment) Divisions; each hex is 15km across, and each turn is 1-2 months of real time (sometimes split into tactical turns of 3-4 days) .&#10;Scale Crete: Units are Multi-Battalion size battlegroups; each hex is 3km across, and each turn is 8-12 hours.&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Carl Paradis&#10;DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch &amp; Charles Kibler&#10;MAP ART: Charles Kibler&#10;&#10;"

Summon the best team of undead fighters and in six turns you&rsquo;ll be named Super Grand Master, a highly coveted and extremely descriptive title.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each necromancer is given a hand containing nine cards. They represent an eccentric collection of skeletons, zombies, vampires, ghouls, and other spooks. Each turn, you select one of these weird characters and send it to the field. Once your opponent has done the same, the fun begins! All the fighters pair off and fight to the death. Normally, this sort of thing would be dangerous, but undead are durable and really get into the spirit of the thing.&#10;&#10;Winners score points while losers are flipped face down. Undead are resilient, so losing fighters will reassemble themselves in time for next turn&rsquo;s battle. But if you don&rsquo;t think your losing fighter will do better next turn, you can pull him out of line and turn him into a spirit. Spirits are the ultimate fans, boosting the power of all of your fighters. Some spirits even let you replace weaker fighters!&#10;&#10;Strategy in Day of the Dead centers around positioning; when played in the right place, any fighter can be a champion.

On turn 6, the final turn, you are allowed to break this rule and choose whatever card back you want.&#10;         The Field Becomes Active &mdash; Flip all cards on the field face up (except for your spirit, it&rsquo;s not on the field though it&rsquo;s watching with considerable interest).

Be aware of what spirits each player has, as they will affect the outcome of each fight.&#10;         Use Effects &mdash; Starting with the player who has the Priority counter, both fighters use their effects. Fighters must use their effects if able.If a player has a Double card as their spirit, they use their fighter&rsquo;s effect, then immediately use it again.&#10;         Add Up the Power &mdash; Add on the printed power of each fighter to any bonuses they may have accumulated via effects or spirits (Remember, if a player has a Power Up card as their spirit, they will get +2 power this fight).&#10;         Compare Power &mdash; The higher-powered fighter is declared winner (in the event of a tie, both fighters are considered winners) and stays active. The lower-powered fighter is declared the loser and flips face down, becoming fallen.&#10;         The Loser May Become a Spirit  &mdash; If your fighter lost its fight this turn and you want to try something new, you can pull it from line and turn it into a spirit.&#10;         Move on to the Next Fight &#10;    &#10;     Rewards &mdash; When you gain victory points.&#10;         Score Victory Points &mdash; Each player scores victory points equal to the printed power values on their active fighters.

Those vegetables are then harvested and taken to the local market where players sell to the waiting customers.&#10;&#10;A game of Matakana takes place over rounds of two distinct phases: Gardening &amp; Harvesting.&#10;&#10;GARDENING PHASE&#10;&#10;In the Gardening phase, players will compete with each other to take a row of cards that will allow them to cultivate their garden. The cards that players collect are:&#10;&#10;1) Gnome cards - allows players to collect gnomes which act as a currency of sorts when planting seeds&#10;&#10;2) Soil cards - allows players to take soil tiles and lay them in their garden (soil tiles come in various shapes and sizes and you will need them before you can plant any seeds)&#10;&#10;3) Sunshine cards - dictates which columns in your garden you are able to plant seeds in this round.&#10;&#10;Depending on the draw of the cards some rows will be more lucrative than others and it will be up to the players to decide when is time to compete for those cards. Once players have collected their cards they will lay soil and plant seeds according to those cards.&#10;&#10;HARVESTING PHASE&#10;&#10;The second phase of the round involves rolling 3 regular dice to determine which column of your garden will harvest vegetables.  The player rolling the dice choices a pair of dice from the roll and the sum of those dice is the column in the garden that all players can harvest.  Players then take vegetable cards that match the seeds they have planted into their hand.&#10;&#10;Players will now have an opportunity to openly trade with each other for vegetables that they do not have.  Players will do this to sell a certain group of vegetables to waiting customers at the local market.  The market is a 9x9 grid made up of 9 customers of varying colours.  Each of these customers is wanting different combinations of vegetables and the players who can serve that customer with the vegetables that they are wanting will take that &quot;Customer&quot; and place it face up in front of them.&#10;&#10;SCORING&#10;&#10;Once the deck of Customers runs out the game will end and players will tally up their scores.

In Greekopoly the object of the game is for the players to travel around the board collecting colonies (fraternities &amp; sororities), build on these, and force other players to go broke. (Players have to pay dues when landing on other player's properties.) When only one solvent player is left, that player is the Winner.&#10;&#10;There are several interesting wrinkles in this title. Unlike in Monopoly where the properties for a neighborhood are within a few spaces of each other, Greekopoly Triads (a combination of 2 fraternities &amp; 1 sorority of the same color) are distributed on different sides of the board. In order to start building on these properties all the properties of a Triad must be owned by the same player. There are also Independent Colonies. Players may build on these without owning other properties, but only when they land on them. (This is in contrast to a Triad which may be built on at the rate of one building or upgrade per turn.) Other properties, simply referred to as Independents (like Greek Sportswear, Campus Pub, etc.) can be bought, but may not be built on.&#10;&#10;The game's IFC cards and TGIF cards fulfill the roll that Community Chest &amp; Chance have in classic Monopoly. They introduce the role of chance (with positive and negative outcomes) with the draw of a card. There are also some special spaces on the board, some positive, and some negative&hellip; like the Dean's Office, where a player may be stuck so long he has to forfeit one of his Colonies.&#10;&#10;This title was clearly meant to capitalize on the enduring popularity of the 1978 film National Lampoon's Animal House&quot; while skirting the need to pay licensing fees. Even the cover art, which also appears on the game board, strongly resembles the style and the content of the poster for Animal House's theatrical release. &#10;&#10;"

As a velociraptor, you must find prey, survive environmental disaster, mutate, and steal the bodies of your enemies.&#10;&#10;You play a velociraptor that grafts new body parts onto itself, mutating your creature in bizarre, horrifying, and hilarious ways. New body parts increase your food requirements, better parts costing more calories. Explore the jungle to find food, and reproduce or mutate further in times of plenty. Attack your opponents to steal their parts or children. Avoid going hungry at all costs.&#10;&#10;The most fruitful Velociraptor will win the day.&#10;&#10;"

Too bad it can carry just one person.&#10;To make things worse, there&rsquo;s no fuel in the Minivan and the Keys are lost somewhere in one of the Shops. It will take both brawns and brains&hellip; It&rsquo;s time to make some heads rolling, betray all the others and run away to safety!&#10;&#10;Night falls over the happy looking Evans City Mall.&#10;Just a few Humans are left roaming all sad and alone with nobody caring for them. No one willing to hug them, no one that loves them. They all roam around that old Minivan, that&rsquo;s weird. And much too weird, they run away or try to hit us with heavy things instead of joining us in a big hug. They are confused by fear and loneliness, but the Horde will never stop loving! It will take some effort and a big heart but we will finally hug and cuddle them all to be happy ever after! Love will finally win over everything else!&#10;&#10;Aim of the Game&#10;Players in Hug Me all starts as humans. But life is hard in Evans City and during the game they can become Infected and later on Zombies.&#10;If you are Human, you must escape the City Mall. To do so you must find the Fuel Tank first, then the Key (or the Spare Key) and take them to the Minivan.&#10;If you are Infected, you must blow up the City Mall so that the Horde cannot spread outside. To do so you must find the Fuel Tank first than the Lighter and take them to the Boiler Room. If you are a Zombie you must hug all humans so that love wins over everything! Zombies win all together when there are no more humans in the game.&#10;Zombie players must really hug Human players to validate the Hug, otherwise the contamination is void!&#10;&#10;Quick Rules&#10;&#10;Dawn: If you are a Zombie, draw a Zombie card, secretly choose one or more Room Cards and place your Zombie Character and the Zombie Card in one or more Rooms.&#10;&#10;Day: According to turn Humans can move and take an action (or vice versa). They can choose one of these Actions: Stealing (Challenge another player to take an Item from him/her), Barricading (Block a Room so that for the rest of the Day and the next night nobody can move to or from that Room also getting a bonus to Zombie Assaults) Searching (Draw an Item from the Deck in the Room where your Character is).&#10;&#10;Night: All Room Cards chosen by Zombie Players are revealed. If there are Humans in those Rooms, Humans face the Assault. If any Human survives, they draw one Zombie Card each and face the normal Assault for that turn.&#10;&#10;If Humans lose an Assault, they try to Escape and if they fail they are Infected and from now on they roll the Zombie Die each turn. If they fail the roll, they become Zombies.&#10;&#10;If an Infected becomes a Zombie, he/she removes his/her Keyholder from the game and starts playing as a Zombie from the next Dawn phase placing his/her Zombie Character and a Zombie Card secretly in one or more Rooms.&#10;&#10;Humans win if, after finding the Fuel Tank and the Key, they get to the Minivan.&#10;Infected win if, after finding the Fuel Tank and the Lighter, they get to the Boiler Room.&#10;Zombies win if there are no more Humans in the game.&#10;&#10;"

So it's a blind-bidding, trick-taking, deck-building hybrid.&#10;&#10;The 144 cards in the deck depict events in the amazing life of the great electrical genius, Nikola Tesla, one of the inventors of our modern age. Following the successes and pitfalls of his life story, each player in this game attempts to accumulate the greatest amount of Voltage (victory points) before the deck runs too low.&#10;&#10;In keeping with the theme, many aspects of the game are in threes, and victory points are measure in Millions of Volts (A.C., of course).&#10;&#10;Each player begins with an &quot;Input Deck&quot; of nine cards. From this they deal themselves a hand of six to play the round. Each round then consists of three tricks. The first trick consists of (A) drawing three &quot;prize cards&quot; from the main deck that the players will try to win and (B) each player chooses three cards from their hand to bid, trying to win those cards. (Sometimes, if the &quot;prize&quot; is undesirable, a player may play low to intentionally lose the trick.) The winner gets the prize cards, and all players keep the cards they played, which go into their &quot;Output Deck&quot; (discard) for future use.&#10;&#10;The second trick in the round uses TWO prize cards and each player plays TWO cards from their hand to the trick. Finally the last trick is a One-Card trick. And again, prize cards go to the player's own Output Deck, and all other cards are recycled by each player.&#10;&#10;In succeeding rounds, when a player's Input Deck is depleted, their Output Deck is shuffled and placed face-down to become the new supply for their hand. This way, the prize cards come into play as the game progresses. Some cards are &quot;Power Cards&quot; which cause extra draws, discards, and actions to be taken which add extra value to one's hand, and can hinder an opponent's efforts.&#10;&#10;The winning is determined after all cards have been won. Some cards are &quot;Positive&quot; and some &quot;Negative&quot; scoring cards, and several have special point values. The suited cards do not have a scoring value UNLESS the player has acquired a &quot;Value for your Voltage&quot; card, which gives those cards points at the end. Therefore, gaining those during the game (even though they have no value until the end) can make the difference in a winning or losing score.&#10;&#10;Now available at Amazon.com and RedHenToys.com !&#10;&#10;"

To start, all puzzle pieces are placed face down in the center and each player takes one pagoda.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the player spins the spinner.  If it lands on black, you turn over a black piece from the pile.  If it lands on white, you turn over a white piece from the pile.  If the upturned piece matches the player's pagoda color, they keep it.  If not, it is shown to all players and returned to the center, white or black side up.  If the spinner lands on Mushu, the player must trade their pagoda with another player.  First player to complete their pagoda with all 4 pieces wins.&#10;&#10;"
