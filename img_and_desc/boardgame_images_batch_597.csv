Each turn, all players play a Pilot card from their hand face-down, with the action of their choice being pointed towards the center of the group of players. The active player then chooses a target, and both of them flip over their Pilot cards and resolve the combat, the loser reducing and keeping track of their remaining health. If the targeted player has chosen a &quot;Pass&quot; action, then the target becomes the player in the direction of the Pass and they participate/resolve the combat instead. These steps continue until only one player has any Pilots remaining.&#10;&#10;"

WWII was in its fifth year, and the German army still controlled most of Western Europe. Field Marshall Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s Army Group B had erected strong fortifications along the coast of Holland, Belgium, and France, including the French Mediterranean coast, creating The Atlantic Wall. The bunkers and minefields were backed up by some of Germany&rsquo;s best troops. Allied forces had been gathering in England and the Mediterranean for more than two years, preparing to assault Hitler&rsquo;s Fortress Europe.&#10;&#10;On D-Day, 6 June 1944, they attacked on what Rommel called &ldquo;the longest day.&rdquo; Success of the invasion was far from guaranteed, but the Allied victory on the beaches signaled the beginning of the end for the Germans in Western Europe.&#10;&#10;Paul Koenig's Fortress Europe recreates the war in Western Europe from the D-day invasion to VE-Day, what General Eisenhower dubbed &ldquo;the mighty endeavor.&rdquo; As the Allied player, you must choose a landing site and then get ashore with a successful landing. This is followed with a breakout of the beachhead and a drive across France, culminating with a deep penetration into Germany itself. As the German player, you must choose a wise defensive alignment of your forces, including hidden units, and hope that you are strong enough at the point of the actual landing to defeat the Allied invasion. If you fail at the water's edge, you must conduct an orderly withdrawal across France, constantly delaying the Allies, until you are strong enough to launch a winter counter-attack (historically, the Battle of the Bulge).&#10;&#10;What's In The Box?:&#10;&#10;&bull;  One 40-page Rulebook&#10;&bull;  One 26&quot; x 38&quot; paper game map&#10;&bull;  Three sheets of double-sided, laser-cut game pieces&#10;&bull;  Four Player Aid cards&#10;&bull;  One six-sided 12mm die&#10;&bull;  One white, 9&quot; x 11 7/8&quot; Deluxe cardboard VPG game box&#10;&bull;  One beautiful box cover sleeve&#10;&bull;  One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin&#10;&bull;  One charcoal dessicant packet&#10;&#10;"

One player (by random draw) is assigned as the Protagonist and is the leader of a group of Heroes trying to expose the Conspiracy.  Another player will secretly start the game as an Agent, posing as a Hero.  Agents win when the Heroes lose.  All other players begin with a Resolve score between 1 and 9.  They start out on the Hero's side, but if and when one of the nine &quot;Conspiracy Expands&quot; cards is revealed in the game, they will switch to an undercover Agent if their Resolve is equal to or lower than the number of Conspiracy Expands cards revealed thus far.  Consequently some players who start as Heroes may choose to play as if they were already Agents right away, others will be Heroes to the end, and some may hedge their bets and try to play both sides.&#10;&#10;There are eight locations on the board that serve as potential centers of the Conspiracy.  The main goal of the Heroes is to identify which location it is, and then successfully infiltrate it enough to get the information they need to expose the Conspiracy.  The way to figure out which is the correct one is to infiltrate three other locations known as the Halls of Power.  If successful, each one will eliminate half of the possible locations and all three together will pinpoint it.  The twelfth location makes all of the other infiltrations easier.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players will typically do three things.  They will move to a location, play a card on that location if they wish, and then they can either use that location's power (to do things like draw or trade cards) or they can try to infiltrate it.  The purpose for playing cards is to make a location easier (or harder) to infiltrate.  The cards range from -5 to +5 and each location starts with one random card on it.  If a player chooses to try and infiltrate a location, they shuffle the cards on top and then reveal all of them.  If the sum of the cards is equal to or greater than a certain changing difficulty number, they succeed.  Otherwise they fail and may face a penalty.&#10;&#10;Successfully infiltrating one of the Halls of Power lets the person doing the infiltration discover one of the leaders of the Conspiracy which in turn narrows down the possible locations of the Conspiracy.  However only the infiltrating player gets to see the card and they may or may not tell the truth about what they saw.  Once the Heroes have an idea of which location is the center of the Conspiracy, they will try to infiltrate it.  If successful, they may take a card from their hand and place it underneath that location.&#10;&#10;The game typically ends when the Protagonist feels the Heroes have played enough cards under the proper location and calls an end to the game.  At that time the cards under the Halls of Power are revealed and the true center of the Conspiracy is determined.  Then the cards under there (if any) are added up and if the total does indeed meet or beat a certain difficulty (called the Exposure Level), the Heroes win.  Otherwise the Agents win.  The Agents also win if the deck runs out of cards or if the Protagonist is killed in a failed infiltration.  The Heroes can alternately win if the Exposure Level ever drops to 0.&#10;&#10;"

For each question the player answers he gets chips from the other players if correct, gives chips if incorrect. The color of the chips exchanged are based on the difficulty of the trivia question, with yellow being the easiest , red in the middle, and blue the hardest. Once the questions are asked, play rotates to the next player to be in charge of the spinner during the next bit of football action.

In each round, the &lsquo;Conspirator&rsquo; leads a card from her hand face-down in the center of the play area. Moving clockwise, players place cards for their value or their ability to control or manipulate the trick while at the same time trying to determine whether they want the face-down Lead card to go to their team or an opponent. The winner of the trick assigns the face-down card to either the &lsquo;Target&rsquo;, herself, or, if the winner of the trick is the Target then to any player she chooses. Once a certain number of cards have been assigned the game ends, and the face-down cards assigned to each player are resolved. The winner is the player or team with the most Royalty Points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;"

150910,,"Bible Bafflers, Jr. is a Bible trivia game with questions belonging to one of 5 different subjects: Old Testament, New Testament, People, History/Geography, and Other Bafflers. Correct answers are scored on a bingo type of scorecard.&#10;&#10;Object of the game (quoted from the game rules):&#10;&quot;To win, a player must answer enough questions to complete a straight line of Bafflewinks across the Baffleboard in any direction -- horizontal, vertical or diagonal.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each Bafflecard lists 5 numbered questions all of the same subject, with the correct answers given on the reverse side of the card. A numbered question is determined by flicking the spinner, and the player answers that question from the top card on the draw pile.&#10;&#10;When a correct answer is given, the player places a Bafflewink on the same number in the column under its subject heading on his Baffleboard. If there is a Bafflewink already on that spot, the player must answer a question from the next card, otherwise play passes to the next player on the left.&#10;&#10;A Baffleboard is basically a 5x5 bingo card, but only the player who answered the question correctly places a Bafflewink on his Baffleboard.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;20 different Baffleboards&#10;200 different Bafflecards- 40 each in one of 5 subjects&#10;105 Bafflewinks (small red transparent discs)&#10;1 spinner&#10;1 set of rules&#10;&#10;Bible Bafflers, Jr. may be played along with the original Bible Bafflers game. It is suggested that the younger players answer questions from the Bible Bafflers, Jr. cards, and the older players answer questions from the original game.&#10;&#10;Team play is allowed.&#10;&#10;Tenwinks is a variant for 2 experienced players. Each player plays with only 10 Bafflewinks. If a player answers a question correctly but all 10 Bafflewinks are already on the player's Baffleboard, then one of those Bafflewinks must be moved to the spot corresponding to the current correct answer.&#10;&#10;The game was published in 1984 by Paraclete Press.&#10;&#10;"

They have been kicked off the ship by their captain in Walk the Plank and chased by sharks in Get Bit, and now they face their final challenge.&#10;&#10;In Hold Your Breath! each player assumes the role of a pirate treading water in the ocean. These brilliant tacticians have decided to play a game of &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot; to see who is the toughest pirate because, you know, what else are you gonna do in the middle of the ocean facing certain death?&#10;&#10;The game is played in two rounds. In the first round, each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. What about the losers? Who cares, they are losers. But if you really want to know, well, they dove down and ran out of oxygen before they could resurface, so now they are just &quot;resting&quot; underwater until the next game, okay? But we digress...&#10;&#10;Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot;, and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before he runs out of air and therefore decides to take a rest. Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner. Be careful, though, because if you dove the deepest in the first round, you will surely have the toughest time getting back to the surface since A) you swam the deepest and B) no one else wants to see you make it back alive.&#10;&#10;"
