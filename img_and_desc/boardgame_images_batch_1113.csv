Players take turns placing cards on the table as they race to &lsquo;snap&rsquo; on all the correct cards. Similar to the classic game of snap. The game is played in rounds where players compete to be the first to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order (3 resource items).&#10;&#10;Objective: Be the first player to snap on all the items that each customer wants in order to collect the active customer card. The first player to collect 3 customer cards wins the game!&#10;&#10;&#10;The Abstract Game:&#10;Summary: This game is like chess for the modern era. Two players sit on either side of the board and move Player Tokens across. Unlike chess, the board&rsquo;s tiles dictate how the Player Tokens can be moved, not the Player Tokens.&#10;&#10;Objective: Win by being the first player to move all 3 of your Player Tokens to the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;The Bidding Game:&#10;Summary: Players are at an auction each with the same amount of money. Can you outsmart your opponents by spending the least to gain the most? The game consists of 10 auctions where players bid on resources, aiming to have the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Objective: Win by having the most points at the end of the game (after 10 auctions).&#10;&#10;The Bluffing Game:&#10;Summary: Can you lie without getting caught? Can you tell when others are lying? Each player starts with 5 coins and one animal card, each with its own special ability to earn or remove coins. Players can choose to lie or tell the truth about which animal card they have in order to earn or remove coins from other players.&#10;&#10;Objective: Win by being the last player remaining with coins. This is a game of elimination.&#10;&#10;The Co-op Game:&#10;Summary: Players must work as a team to find and arrest the 2 Diamond thieves while protecting the innocent bystanders. To do this, each player must choose a card from their hand and perform the actions stated on the card. Winning will take real teamwork.&#10;&#10;Objective: When both Diamond thieves are arrested everyone wins, but when 2 innocent bystanders are arrested everyone loses!&#10;&#10;The Dice Game:&#10;Summary: Seven animals race around a track while all players watch and bet, aiming to earn the most money by the end of the game. There are multiple ways of earning money including betting on the winners/losers or buying land (like Monopoly) that earns money when animals land on them.&#10;&#10;Objective: The player who has the most money when the first animal reaches the finish line wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Hidden Identity Game:&#10;Summary: Can you figure out who among you are lying? Players are assigned a secret identity, which will either be on the innocent team or the guilty team. Players close their eyes while listening to an audio recording from Game Changer&rsquo;s website, which instructs certain animals to perform specific actions while everyone else has their eyes closed. In the second phase of the game, all players open their eyes and discuss what happened in order to determine who the guilty team is, while the guilty team lie to try to not get caught!&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;Objective: After 5 minutes of discussion, all players vote on who they think is the guilty team. If the majority vote is correct, the innocent team wins. If the majority vote is incorrect, the guilty team wins.&#10;&#10;The Market Game:&#10;Summary: Players visit a bustling market to buy and sell valuable resources in order to earn the most amount of money. Players must decide whether to claim, swap, trade, or sell resources to customers in order to profit the most.&#10;&#10;Objective: The first player to reach $40 worth of coins wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Memory Game:&#10;Summary: This game combines memory and strategy. Resource Cards are placed face down on the table with players able to peek at any 2 cards to start their turn. The goal is to collect sets of matching Resource Cards by remembering their location on the table. Each player has their own memory bank where they can strategically store up to 2 sets of cards that will help them complete sets and stop other players from collecting them.&#10;&#10;Objective: The game ends when there are no more Resource Cards left in the middle of the table. The player with the most cards collected wins.&#10;&#10;The Numbers Game:&#10;Summary: Are your reactions fast enough to be the first to snap on cards? Players take turns placing cards on the table as they race to &lsquo;snap&rsquo; on all the correct cards. Similar to the classic game of snap. The game is played in rounds where players compete to be the first to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order (3 resource items).&#10;&#10;Objective: Be the first player to snap on all the items that each customer wants in order to collect the active customer card. The first player to collect 3 customer cards wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Party Game:&#10;Summary: Are your reactions fast enough to be the first to snap on cards? Players take turns placing cards on the table as they race to &lsquo;snap&rsquo; on all the correct cards. Similar to the classic game of snap. The game is played in rounds where players compete to be the first to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order (3 resource items).&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;Objective: Be the first player to snap on all the items that each customer wants in order to collect the active customer card. The first player to collect 3 customer cards wins the game!&#10;&#10;The Realtime Game:&#10;Summary: This game involves a lot of yelling! Players simultaneously yell out the actions written on their cards to try to find another player yelling out the same action. Once a player has found a match, the matching players both perform that action e.g. &lsquo;Team Spirit&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bro Bump&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pinky Swear&rsquo;. Both players then discard the Action Cards. The goal is to be the first player who finds matches for all their cards, therefore having zero Action Cards remaining in their hand.&#10;&#10;Objective: The first player to discard all of the Action Cards in their hand wins.&#10;&#10;The Set Collecting Game:&#10;Summary: Players attempt to create the strongest sets to win, like in Poker. However, unlike Poker, there are 7 Resource Cards face up on the table which players compete for. Each resource card states a rule that explains how that card can be won. The player who satisfies the rule at the end of the game wins that resource card, and the player with the most resource card points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Objective: The player with the highest total value of resource cards wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Storytelling Game:&#10;Summary: Players tell a funny group story using cards from their hand and trying to be the first player to use up all their cards. To use up their cards faster, players may interrupt other players&rsquo; stories using special cards. Each player also has their own pre-written custom ending which they need to use.&#10;&#10;Objective: The first player to use up all their cards and end the story with their ending wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Tile Game:&#10;Summary: Place tiles on the table next to each other to create a continuous road. Be the first player to collect 3 Treasure Chests. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll need to slow down your opponent(s) by re-routing and blocking their path(s) to ensure you are the first to collect the Treasure Chests.&#10;&#10;Objective: The first player to collect 3 Treasure Chests wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Everything runs off the roll of 5 d20 dice. The game is fairly simple yet has depth in how plays turnout. The tabletop version uses charts and dice.&#10;&#10;To begin with the dice are rolled to get the play type, depth, and the who which is all based off a teams' offensive chart. The plays take into account the down, distance, and the ball location on the field. Later in the game, time left and the score can affect the play calls as well. This roll also on occasion can trigger a fumbled snap or a pre-snap penalty.&#10;&#10;Once the play is known we progress to the play itself which require rolling 5d20 dice. To start, the red die gets you the defender for the play (this player comes off the defensive teams chart), and who the player is also depends on the game situation (a passing situation is more likely to get a player from the secondary while a run play is more likely to have a lineman).&#10;&#10;For a PASS: The white die gives you how the defender affects the play. They can get pressure on a QB, get a chance to break up a pass, allow an open receiver, which will result in the receiver making a catch, a drop, or yards after a catch. The blue die is checked against the QB or the receiver, depending on what the defensive player allowed. The black die gets your yardage and the yellow die is for a possible penalty.&#10;&#10;For a RUN: The white die gives you how the defender affects the play. They can get penetration and hit a runner in the backfield, hit the runner at the line, or allow a hole for the runner to run through. The blue die gets how the runner reacts to what the defense gave them by spinning away from a loss, to breaking a run through a hole. The black die gets you the yardage gained and the yellow die is used for a possible penalty.&#10;&#10;Special team plays are as simple as rolling the 5d20 and using them to get distance, the returner and yardage, along with chances for penalties and fumbles.&#10;&#10;Players are rated so that their impact in the game reflect their real life styles. So while the game may seem simple there is a ton of interaction allowing everything that happens in a football game to happen on the tabletop with 5D20 Football.&#10;&#10;"

The primary objective is to establish and maintain the support of the population for your cause, but to do so often requires one to have control or possession of the territory where people live, and for that one must take command of your nation's forces, maneuver and engage in battles to secure the colonies.&#10;&#10;Both sides have very unique and distinct advantages.  The British with their professional force and naval prowess can dominate coastal positions, but may have some difficulty when getting too far away from their coastal bases.  They know the longer the war drags on the more chances Americans will have to secure French support along with building up their forces to a higher standard.  As such, the British will want to hit the ground running and maintain the pressure, seeking out engagement after engagement to decimate the rebel forces so when they are better trained it will be immaterial at that point, or a day late and a dollar short.&#10;&#10;The American's on the other hand need time to secure an alliance with the French and convert this rag-tag band of revolutionaries into a professional army to really flip the script but one doesn't always get the army they want, when they need it and have to fight with the army they have.  As such, to buy time and save face with the population the American forces will need to make the British advance as costly as possible by occupying advantageous terrain, leveraging the support of the population with Militia forces, and knowing when to simply run away.&#10;&#10;The game incorporates cards but is not a card driven game, the cards provide enhancements and bonus abilities as well as enable deception actions that can really through a wrench in the works for your opponent.&#10;&#10;When forces contest territory on the Game Board, the game zooms in to a unique battle sequence, which is a mini-game itself; units deploy into lanes of combat and roll dice to score hits and kills with bonuses and enhancements for aspects like rout, exposed flank (enfilade), and Dragoon Charge.&#10;&#10;Can you lead your nations forces to victory?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
