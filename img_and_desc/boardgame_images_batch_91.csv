Although the cover art depicts a dramatic B-25 bombing mission from World War II, the pieces and artwork on the mapboard reflect aircraft from the sixties, and the aircraft playing pieces are jets. Played on a square grid with the units moving from point to point. The object is to destroy the enemy headquarters with a long distance missile or to eliminate all enemy air power.&#10;&#10;"

10397,,"&quot;Togoland 1914&quot; is a wargame covering the Anglo-French campaign to capture the radio station in German-controlled Togoland at the outbreak of World War I.&#10;&#10;The pressure on the Germans is to set up a defense that will prevent the Allies from taking the radio station in the alloted time - they also need to defend their supply dump, as once they lose it they cannot raise new units or attack anymore.  The Allies need to take ground, but they must be careful not to spook the Germans into blowing the radio station before they can capture it.&#10;&#10;Units stacked with a leader are deployed on a hidden unit display and a traditional odds ratio CRT is used.  As the units present in this campaign are inexperienced, casualties are quite heavy in combat, with one side generally being wiped out.  An attack can be modified for the presence of entrenchments, machine guns or artillery, all of which played a role in the battle, and a successful attacker can see his units advance and attack again in the same period.&#10;&#10;Each hex is 15 miles, each game turn is two to three days (there are nine turns in total) and each unit is a platoon, company, combat group, artillery section or machine gun section.&#10;&#10;"
