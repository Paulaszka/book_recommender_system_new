Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.&#10;&#10;From the website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Nominated for the Charles S. Roberts Award for best historical miniatures rules set in 1996, the rules have been refined and expanded from hundreds of players&rsquo; feedback. The result is a game system which allows a huge number of aircraft to be easily handled without the tedium of written orders.  Multiple sets can be combined to allow large games that are limited only by the space provided by the players.&#10;&#10;The game originates from &quot;Squadrons: The Battle of Britain&quot; written in 1994.   As a result of the success of Squadrons demand for more aircraft appeared.   The Blue Sky Series of games resulted in the new rules Red Sun / Blue Sky.   This was done to normalize aircraft statistics across theaters of war by revamping the formulas for calculating plane statistics.&#10;&#10;The resulting rulesets / expansions have been published:&#10;Red Sun, Blue Sky - Pacific Theater (Main Ruleset)&#10;Blue Sea, Blue Sky - Mediterranean Theater (Expansion)&#10;White Star, Blue Sky - Daylight Bombing  (Expansion)&#10;Red Star, Blue Sky - Russian Front (Expansion)&#10;Black Cross, Blue Sky - Battle of Britain (Re-implements the Battle of Britain and provides for cardboard planes). 2nd Edition of Rules&#10;Lost Squadrons Black Cross, Blue Sky - Expansion for Black Cross.&#10;&#10;All planes published in these modules are compatible and can be played against each other.    Only the planes from the original Squadrons are incompatible.    While it took 10 years to publish Black Cross the expansion rulebooks even mention the requirement to have the black cross rulebooks or red sun rulebooks to play.&#10;&#10;While the cardboard planes are not available for the theater books the plane statistics are 100% compatible.&#10;&#10;"
