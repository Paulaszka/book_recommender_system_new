In August the Malta garrison was on the ropes, with critical supplies nearly exhausted. Allied forces were in full retreat towards Egypt following their defeat in the Gazala Campaign. The Axis forces realized the Pedestal Convoy could very well be the battle for &quot;all the marbles&quot; and mobilized tremendous air, submarine and surface fleet assets to contest its passage. The Allied convoy was savaged but enough ships made it through, including the tanker Ohio whose ordeal was a true epic of wartime heroism, to enable Malta to hold out.&#10;&#10;Can you do better?&#10;&#10;"

Every player selected contributes one Item card to a common pool, and other items are added randomly from the draw pile. These cards can be helpful, non-helpful, or even harmful. The Party Leader distributes one card to each party member, and the Quest commences, with each player taking a turn using the item they were given, if able. To use the items given, each player uses dice that are secretly pulled and rolled, but beware, doppelg&auml;ngers may choose to roll cursed dice! If the party succeeds, the Party Leader may search for an Artifact of Light. Find three of these, and the loyal adventurers win the game. However, if a Quest fails, an Artifact of Darkness may be found, and if three are uncovered, the doppelg&auml;ngers win.

If a player can defeat a band in each of 16 cities, they can then move into the center city, and attempt to win one last battle to score a record contract, and win the game.&#10;&#10;The band names and logos, printed onto the old-school wooden 45rpm record adapters that are used as the player pawns, the board, and the card art and text combine to portray a world out of the school notebook of some mid-1970's Led Zeppelin loving, Dungeons and Dragons obsessive teenager.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving around the board a number of spaces determined by the roll of a standard die, either fighting a band battle, rolling for movement again, or passing play depending on where they land. Each player holds a hand of five &quot;Fate&quot; cards, which might be one of four kinds of band members that can be played in front of the player, and persist from turn to turn; bonus cards that can help the player in battle; and cards that can be played to penalize other players. During a battle, the player draws a &quot;Foe&quot; card, representing a band they will battle, rolls a four-sided die to determine which band member will battle, and plays Fate cards to boost their chances. The result of the battle is found by rolling a twenty-sided die, plus whatever bonuses from the players own Fate cards, penalties from cards played by other players, versus a score on the Foe card. If the player wins the battle, they collect the &quot;banner&quot; for the city, tracked by each player on a card reminiscent of an auto-bingo card. Play passes around the table until a player collects all 16 of the banners, allowing them to finally enter the center city, &quot;Numenor&quot;, and battle one last time in a bid for victory.&#10;&#10;"

It is translated as 'Genpei War'. The 'Gen' is the Chinese pronunciation of the character for Minamoto, one of the two main combatants. 'Pei' (or 'Hei) similarly refers to the Taira, so it's the 'Minamoto-Taira War'. A strategic simulation of the 1180-1185 conflict in Japan involving the Minamoto and Taira warrior houses, it reflects the fact that fighting was not done strictly along 'clan' lines by including as other factions the Kiso (a branch of the Minamoto), the Fujiwara, and the Imperial Family. The war is still a popular subject in Japan today, being immortalized by period literature such as the Heike Monogatari ('Tale of the Heike') and live performances by blind biwa (lute) players.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-4 players taking the part of one of the four main combatants-the Taira (SW Japan), Kiso (a Minamoto branch, central Japan), Minamoto (SE Japan), and Fujiwara (N Japan). There are rules for a 5th player to operate abstractly as the Insei (retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa, meddling with the plans of the four warrior houses. There are several different scenarios involving different numbers of players and levels of conquest. Gameplay features area movement of generic land and naval forces. Armies are generic and all have the same value, and are boosted by the values of leaders accompanying them. None of the leaders are named but each has a different skill level (if you're familiar with the history, it's easy to figure out the names that go with each leader counter). Naval warfare and sea movement of troops is somewhat abstract and confined to the southern areas of the map. Cardplay has a big effect on gameplay as cards can lead to possession of the Emperor, abundant crops, famine (denying victory points), access to independent naval forces, and other events. Victory is determined by both provinces held each turn (each province is worth a varying number of points) and enemy units destroyed.&#10;&#10;Starting positions for the game are somewhat historically inaccurate; this was done for play balance as the Kiso are facing a two front war with the other combatants initially only having one. Factions are differentiated by their leader and naval pools. The Fujiwara have no navy, three overpoweringly wealthy provinces, and have the strongest leader in the game (and an extremely strong sub-leader). The Kiso have a middling leader, no navy, 23 relatively poor provinces, and a small pool of back up leaders. The Minamoto have a solid and large leadership pool but no navy and start with 14 provinces worth a moderate amount. The Taira have the misfortune of having an excellent leader being a subordinate of the worst leader in the game, but start off with naval forces and 20 moderately valuable provinces. There are also 3 neutral provinces that can be invaded during the game. Overall, the game has a good feel for the war it seeks to recreate and the difficulties faced by each faction.&#10;&#10;"

Each cattle tile has a value and a race. A set contains only tiles of the same race, ordered in ascending or descending value. For each race, your cattle tiles are arranged in a line. New cattle tiles are added to the end of the line. When you add a tile that doesn't match the ordering of the existing set, that means that set ends and a new set is started.&#10;&#10;Obtaining cattle is done through a worker placement system. Each player has seven Gauchos which can be placed on various action spaces. The most important of these is the Pampa, where Gauchos can catch cattle (which means the player gains a new cattle tile). Other actions include stealing cattle from other players and sorting your cattle (to optimize your sets).&#10;&#10;Placing the Gauchos on an action space requires dice. Each action requires a specific value. These dice are taken from the Dice Rodeo. At the beginning of each round, the dice are rolled. During his turn, a player takes two dice from the Dice Rodeo and uses them to place his Gauchos.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each completed set of cattle is sold.

It is a game of strategy and tactics where battles (of perhaps more than one day) are able to be played in a few hours.&#10;The basic unit of control is the battalion (or national equivalent). This is a unit of individual bases (usually around four), where each base represents a company (or squadron of tanks). This battalion-sized unit is called a combat unit. A group of these combat units, usually two to four, is called a battle group.&#10;An example of a battle group is a British armoured brigade, where the individual armoured regiments are the combat units. The four bases within each represent the squadrons within the regiments.&#10;The focus of Lightning War is not on detail (for instance, range bands and armour penetration tables) but on troop types, the training of the soldiers involved and command control.&#10;&#10;All troops and commanders have a quality rating from one (worst) to five (best). This is not the valour of the individual soldier, but a measure of how effective they are in combat.&#10;A turn is two hours and a combat unit (battalion) can perform one or two actions a turn depending on the quality of the troops and a die roll.&#10;Battle groups move sequentially between sides &ndash; not one side after the other &ndash; depending on the quality of the troops and headquarters involved.&#10;Combat units can become fatigued once they suffer casualties and commands can become exhausted (once half the units within them are fatigued). The effects of fatigue and exhaustion are to slow or even stop advances.&#10;Bases are usually 30mm by 30mm for micro armour, but other sizes can be used. Place as many infantry figures on a base as desired (four or five seems a good number). A vehicle or gun base has one model on it.&#10;&#10;"

The rules cover the period from when all European nations adopted the three-man-deep platoon firing system up until the rise of the mass conscript armies of the Napoleonic era; very roughly A.D. 1740-1790, when musketry weight of fire ruled the battlefield. The rules do not try to recreate every aspect of 18th Century warfare; for example, the rules ignore most of the complexities of maneuver.&#10;&#10;The rules are intended only to model the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; tactics of the period.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed for games using 6-12 units per side. A game like this should take about four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete. Typical game setup involves two fairly equal forces facing one another across a game table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc. Victory conditions to win the game may vary widely, but usually one player wins when a stated number of the enemy&rsquo;s units have been destroyed or routed off the game table before a set number of turns have been played.&#10;&#10;"
