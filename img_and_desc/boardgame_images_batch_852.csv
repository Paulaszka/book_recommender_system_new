The first player then secretly changes one or two pieces and shows it again to the other player, who must identify the changes.  Players take turns until one has identified ten changes correctly.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kim's Game - Players take turns being the dealer.  They place 20 silhouette pictures on the table, give other players a few seconds to look and then secretly remove one or more.  Players then must mark on their board which pieces have been removed, keeping the markers for correct guesses.  After each player has been dealer twice, the player with the most markers wins.  &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     What Followed Next? - Players start with a set of eight pictures face-down.  The first player chooses a picture, looks at it, says aloud what it is and then places it face-down, starting a row.  The second player chooses a second tile, looks and then must say the name of the first and second tiles in order.  The third player must name the first two tiles in order and then his or her newly-drawn tile.  This continues until a player thinks another has made a mistake and calls for a check.  The tiles are checked and whichever player is wrong is eliminated.  Play includes until only one player remains.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     In the Pocket Game - Each player has a board depicting 20 objects.  Silhouette tiles of these objects form a supply.  In turn, each player chooses a silhouette and hides it.  The player to the left then asks a yes/no question about the item (e.g. &quot;is it round?&quot;).  If the answer is no, the next player asks a question.  If the answer is yes, the asker may guess the identity of the item.  If correct, the player receives the tile and places it in the correct space on his or her board.  If incorrect, the next player may take a turn.  The player who wins the tile becomes the next to choose a tile and answer questions.  The first player to get five tiles wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Each turn you take cards from the middle, put some from your hand back, and then add more cards to the middle from the deck.

Declaring victory in a color is advantageous but might not be enough to overcome a sneaky player; whoever has the most points total over all victorious colors wins the round. This means that besides winning on the strength of your own hand, you can win by investing in multiple suits other people are stronger in.&#10;&#10;The most subtle part of the game is the different kinds of cards. While some cards give a simple color bonus, those are the rarest. The next most common type can count for either of two colors during scoring, but don't count towards the 10 for declaring victory. Most cards are worth few points on their own, but worth more in pairs with specific cards - in particular, the purple color has no invidually strong cards, but is worth the most with the right pair. Each color has its own distribution, and keeping that in mind is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Can you read the other players to figure out which color you should throw your lot in with?&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Your first task will be to seek out and discover the great Indian cities and empires -- which may appear in their historical locations, or in quite different places. Once you discover where the cities and empires are, it is time to gather gold. You might battle and plunder the Indians, or your best plan may be to attempt diplomacy and enlist them as allies -- especially if you have an Indian interpreter in your expedition. Like Francisco Pizarro, you might try a Sudden Shock Attack to capture a native king and extort a fat ransom. Always you must be sure to keep the Governor happy, or he may issue a warrant for your arrest. Beware of native uprisings, painted warriors, and poisoned darts around the next corner, and watch out for defection in your own ranks. If you fall behind in the race for gold, you might try to descend the Amazon or discover the Fountain of Youth. And when you are really in a tight place, perhaps you can appeal to Mano de Dios (the Hand of God) to bail you out.&#10;&#10;The Conquistadors is playable by from 1 to 5 players, with an introductory Basic Game, a more involved Standard Game, and some optional rules.

The game allows you to use your own characters from your system of choice and play mini-adventures. &#10;In this game, everyone gets the opportunity to play, and everyone gets the opportunity to GM. It's a rule-lite game that builds player confidence with d20 RPG systems and encourages skills and experience with GMing.&#10;&#10;The Game-play:&#10;&#10;Players: 2-6 (but can stretch to 8 depending on the mode)&#10;Playtime: 30-180min (dependant on how much players like to roleplay)&#10;&#10;The game is formed primarily of:&#10;Quest cards, hunt cards, location cards, a set of meeples, and a set of dice. The quest/hunt cards have plot-hooks written on the front and GM notes on the back. The location cards are drawn when the players are resting in the town after a hard day adventuring; the cards contain a mixture of bonuses and setbacks.&#10;&#10;The game has three primary modes of play, head-to-head, co-operative, and classic. &#10;In head-to-head, 1-4 players build a party of four adventurers and compete with each other to become the most successful/famous party in the land. Players move from town-to-town, completing quests and trying to earn: coin, renown, and experience points.&#10;In co-operative mode, 3-6 players choose a character and join forces to form a party. The players head to a local town and aim to clear the board of quests within 5 days. &#10;In classic mode, 2-6 players choose characters to form a party and compete with a GMs rival party of adventurers.&#10;&#10;Applications as a tool:&#10;The game was originally designed to be used as a prop during DND. The game can be used to manage downtime or as a way to introduce the party during session zero. It can also be used to generate plot-hooks or side-quests during the game. &#10;The game itself is a great way to pass the time while you are waiting for other players to show up or as an alternative when players unexpectedly cancel.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Your fate is determined by how well you deal with the inherent dilemmas of the game, and the conflict.&#10;&#10;1) Will you push to gain prestige at the risk of escalating the crisis to global nuclear war?&#10;2) How do you best manage your hand of cards to further your own plans while depriving your opponent of options?&#10;&#10;Work out these dilemmas in order to emerge as victor of the Cuban Missile Crisis after thirteen suspenseful days.&#10;&#10;13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a meaty filler utilizing the card-driven game mechanisms.

That humble little magazine insert game, published in 2012, introduced concepts that over time gave birth to Hollandspiele's Blood in the Fog and, eventually, the Shot &amp; Shell Battle Series. So it is perhaps fitting that seven years and nearly forty published designs later, Mr. Russell would turn his attention back to the topic that started it all, redesigned from the ground-up through the lens of the Shot &amp; Shell system. The result is The Heights of Alma.&#10;&#10;The heights overlooking the Alma River provided a natural defensive advantage for the Russians, who proceeded to utterly squander it with slapdash entrenchments and a left flank that was completely exposed. It didn't help that the commander of that left wing was several sheets to the wind. At least he was on the field; on the opposing side, British commander Lord Raglan snuck behind enemy lines for a better view of the battle without telling his subordinates, leaving his army without any orders. Frontal charges against the Russian heavy guns were as costly as they were pointless. Eventually, a group of men disobeyed orders, choosing to stand and fire instead - discovering, to their delight, that their new Mini&eacute; rifles outranged the enemy artillery! They would have known that from the beginning if anyone had bothered to listen to their French allies - the only side to acquit themselves competently.&#10;&#10;The historical scenario recreates this glorious mess of a battle. Three additional scenarios explore increasing levels of coordination and competence on either side. This game has more special rules than the previous Shot &amp; Shell title (Seven Pines; or, Fair Oaks), resulting in a more complex and nuanced experience, but not so many rules that it bogs the thing down - a given scenario will still be resolved within a couple of hours.&#10;&#10;"

In every show, the fierce competition between queens makes them give everything on stage, making the crowd go wild each night. But, who&rsquo;s the best of the best? Which queen deserves to be recognized as the Divaest Diva of the show? It&rsquo;s time for you to put on your heels, gown, nails and wig and show you deserve the crown, even if that implies sabotaging your fellow queens&hellip;&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player gets one of four secret Divas, indicating with which card and how many copies of them in front of them, they have to get to win the game.

Katie Hart, the showgirl, wins with 4 Spotlight cards and Lee O&rsquo;poldo, the evil queen, wins when another player gets 4 Shade cards in their area.&#10;&#10;So, there&rsquo;s a deck with these four cards: Laugh, Fame, Spotlight and Shade. You get 4 initial cards. In your turn, you draw one card from the deck and play one of the cards in your hand in front of you (or if it&rsquo;s Shade, in front of another player). Clockwise, players will draw and play cards until one reveals their secret identity, showing it accomplished their objective, winning the game.&#10;&#10;But that&rsquo;s not all! Each card, when played and even on the table, has an especial effect. Fame cards allow you to play additional cards in your turn. Shade cards cancel Fame cards and allows you to steal cards from that player&rsquo;s hand. Laugh cards makes you switch a cards position on the table from one player or another. And finally, with the Spotlight cards, you draw 3 cards and discard 2. Every card is useful, even if they doesn&rsquo;t make you win the game directly!&#10;Balance is settled with card mix and double cards, that you can play using one of the sides only (and remain in that position even when stolen) and also affect the winning condition, making players hard to deduce how wins each player.&#10;&#10;Las Divas is a game of temporal alliances, betrayal, deception and fabulous-ness, encouraging players to act like be a queen, making drama, stealing the show and revealing their hidden talents.&#10;&#10;It was published in Argentina in 2018, thanks to a succesful crowdfunding campaign.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The French victory confirmed their recovery from the mutinies spawned by the disastrous Nivelle Offensive fought over some of the same ground six months earlier.&#10;&#10;In a six-day preliminary bombardment, French guns, with a three to one advantage, silenced most of their German counterparts and smothered German rear areas with dense gas to impeded German reinforcements. At 0515 on October 23 (zero hour), six divisions of the French XI, XIV, and XXI corps attacked on a 7.5-mile wide front. French infantry advanced in the predawn twilight behind an elaborate creeping barrage with 63 Schneider and Saint-Chamond tanks in support. Twenty-seven of the 63 tanks bogged before reaching the front line. A combination of German fire and mud stopped 15 more in no man's land. Twenty-one French tanks (1/3rd of the starting total) actually made it to the German second position. The French 38th Division captured Fort de Malmaison and XXI Corps took Allemant and Vaudesson. From 24 to 25 October, XXI and XIV corps advanced while I Cavalry Corps came forward to exploit a hoped-for German collapse.&#10;&#10;With specialized &ldquo;eingreif&rdquo; companies sprinkled all along the front, the Germans launched numerous local counterattacks. However, the French wave was inexorable. Still, the German 7th Army retired from the Chemin-des-Dames to the north bank of the Ailette in good order.&#10;&#10;By October 26, the French had gained 3.5 miles in some places at a cost of only 12,000 casualties, far fewer than Germany&rsquo;s 38,000 and a significant improvement over the 30,000 French losses suffered in the same area during April&rsquo;s Nivelle Offensive.

Battle of the Bulge is a two-player wargame of the German offensive against the Western Allies in December 1944, designed by renowned wargame designer John H. Butterfield and based on his original boardgame design that was later released in digital format by Shenandoah Studios, an imprint of Slitherine UL Ltd.&#10;&#10;The simple elegance and high player-interaction of the WWII Commander games recreates the tension of key battles of the Second World War. The overall game system is easy to learn and makes a great introduction to war games, but mastering its tactics and strategy is a true challenge as the players take turns deciding which units to activate on either attack or defense. As the German player, you must make big gains and be as aggressive as possible while you hold the numerical advantage without over-committing your units, over-extending supply lines or falling prone to fuel shortages. As the Allied player, you must first withstand the initial German surprise attack and coordinate effective holding actions while defending key geographic objectives as you muster your arriving forces for counterattacks.&#10;&#10;The package features premium components throughout; from the mounted game board and oversized units, to the activation cubes and wooden control discs, sure to appeal to war gamers and euro gamers alike.

For by its very nature, the act of self-coronation threatened the rule and challenged the legitimacy of every government then in existence.&#10;&#10;To restore the sanctity of the divine right and position based on noble birth, the European monarchies branded Bonaparte an international outlaw and pledged to remain at war against France until the Corsican usurper was overthrown and the Bourbon was restored.

The game has several scenarios. Two scenarios cover a US invasion of Iran in the aftermath of the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-81. A third scenario covers an Oil War situation, where the US leads a NATO effort to seize Persian Gulf oilfields in response to an oil embargo.&#10;&#10;The game system models ground, air and amphibious operations. For the Allies, the central game system is Air Transport Points (ATP). These represent strategic airlift capability. The assumption is that the scenarios cover the opening stage of an intervention, before the US can mobilize full-scale sealift. Therefore, airlift will become the primary means for moving units into the theater and provide logistic support.&#10;&#10;The opposing Opposition Forces (OPFOR) have a better logistical situation since they can rely on local supply. But many of their military units are erratic in performance. This is modeled by untried units and other game functions.&#10; Each hex on the map represents 60 kilometers from side to side. Each turn of play represents anything from three days of intense combat to ten days of refitting. Ground units represent regiments, brigades, divisions and groups of irregulars. Special operations forces (SOF) represents unconventional warfare activities. Aircraft units represent anything from one to four squadrons, depending on the quality of air force and operational tempo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Since those missions ended, generations have watched replays and movies of the landings, read books by the Astronauts, and wondered what it was like to be on those missions. But aside from some computer simulations over the decades, there has never been a comprehensive way to immerse yourself in an Apollo Lunar Mission. Until now.&#10;&#10;Now you can experience the challenge and excitement of flying an Apollo Lunar Mission with APOLLO: The Game of Our First Voyages to the Moon.  A collaborative board game, Apollo puts players in the Spacecraft and Mission Control, responsible for critical decisions and maneuvers throughout the spaceflight to the Moon.  Based upon extensive research of public NASA documents, photographs, and mission reports, Apollo begins on the pad at Launch Complex 39A. It is T-minus 15 seconds to liftoff and the players will feel the uncertainty of launching on the most powerful rocket ever made, the Saturn V. Their goal is to fly a mission to the Moon's surface and a successful return to Earth. But like the real Apollo missions, systems may fail, astronauts may fall ill, critical maneuvers must be performed flawlessly -  decisions will have to be made to continue the mission or abort to bring the crew home.&#10;&#10;The players become the Apollo Mission Commander, the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP), the Command Module Pilot (CMP) and Mission Control Houston. Each position has critical roles to play in the outcome of the mission - but if you don't have 4 people to play the game, don't worry - you can easily combine the roles or even play by yourself!&#10;&#10;After mastering the basic Lunar Landing Mission, players can fly all of the Historic Apollo Lunar Missions, with more challenging mission goals in order to obtain scientific samples and data.&#10;&#10;Also included are the cancelled Apollo 18-19 missions and a dedicated Apollo 13 &quot;Houston, we have a problem scenario&quot;. Or pick your favorite Astronauts of the era and create your own Apollo Mission crew - The &quot;what if&quot; possibilities are endless&#10;&#10;&#10;"

While you're doing this, another player flips a 30-second sand timer four times, giving you two minutes to answer as many questions as possible.

There's plenty of player interaction as you can connect your houses up to theirs, swap guests from their queues to yours, raise and lower the fear level of various guests with effects cards - all to keep players on their toes and ruin the most well laid of plans.&#10;&#10;Your workers can head into town to research new house tiles, recruit more workers, promote their house and attract guests, or collect the necessary resources to build their house.&#10;&#10;The workers also double as scarers! They can head into the house to help scare guests in the correct directions or they can work the queue at the front-of-house to prime guests for a more frightening experience. But be careful! Many guests have special attributes that can throw a wrench in things like &quot;Screamer&quot; - this guest will raise the fear level of every adjacent guest when they become scared! Use these different abilities to play guests off one another or interrupt other player's plans.&#10;&#10;The only way to get cash is by admitting people to your house, they pay the second they come in whether they have a good time or not. As a guest enters, you'll slot them into a standee base with a rotating dial to track their fear level.&#10;&#10;If guests have a good time, you can invite them to come back. If guests die, they take up precious storage bays and prevent you from storing the necessary resources to build up your house. If you kill too many guests, it means a change of management and a huge loss of points.&#10;&#10;The gameplay goes on a night-by-night basis for 7 days leading up to halloween, resetting and paying workers at the end of each night. As the game wraps up after all the guests leave on Halloween night, Euro-style rules kick in and players reveal secret values each of their successfully scared guests contribute to their total score.&#10;&#10;Spook House is a complex game with multiple strategies to win, currently clocking in around 3 hours for a full playthrough with four players.
