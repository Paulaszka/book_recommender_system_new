If you've never played a trick-taking game before, Deadly Desserts is the perfect game to start with! The game is played in a series of tricks, in which players play one card each. The winner of each trick takes the cards, most of which deal damage. Thus, your objective is to avoid winning tricks! It's a very fun gameplay style because you win by not winning.&#10;&#10;If you're familiar with trick-taking games, Deadly Desserts builds off of classics (e.g. Hearts, Euchre, Bridge) and adds exciting gameplay features, such as Gourmayhem Cards to double cards' values or being able to play 2-10 players rather than 3-4.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Search for clues and find evidence while you track the spy, but watch out for dangerous explosives!&#10;&#10;To Catch a Spy is a 1-2 player game of espionage. To set up, place nine location cards in a 3x3 grid, then place discovery cards under each location. Place three file cards near the locations, then place case cards under each file. Place decks for arrow cards and additional discovery cards nearby, along with two agent tool cards. The spy and agent cards start in different locations.&#10;&#10;In the solo game, you are the agent and go first, moving to an adjacent location and revealing a discovery card, which could be an item, clue, or bomb; item and clue cards go in hand, while bombs force you to discard. You can use a location's special ability and clues to reveal case cards under files. You might be able to place a tracking bug on the spy.&#10;&#10;For the spy's turn, the arrow cards move the spy to an adjacent location, where a new discovery card is placed at random. If the spy moves to your location, discard a card. If you can't discard a card or discover you've discarded an item matching a case card, you lose immediately.&#10;&#10;When the discovery deck is empty, the spy attempts to escape. You must have placed a tracking bug on the spy, have the three item cards in hand matching the case cards, and make it to the spy's current location before the spy escapes.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, one player is the spy while the other is the agent. At the start of a round, each player chooses and reveals an arrow card, then the agent takes their turn, followed by the spy. Gameplay takes place as described above, with the spy needing to place all cards in the discovery deck before trying to escape, while the agent needs to collect the three items matching the case, bug the spy, then reach the spy's location.&#10;&#10;Awards:&#10;&#10;From the 2020 54-Card Game Design Contest.&#10;-Best Solo Game: 1st place!&#10;-Best Overall Game: 2nd place!&#10;-Best 2 Player Game: 2nd place!&#10;-Best Graphic Design: 3rd place!&#10;&#10;"

304017,,"This game is played with a standard 52 card deck, either solo as a simulation, or a two-player game where two teams compete against each other in a simulated cricket match.&#10;&#10;A coin flip decides who bats or bowls first and play begins by drawing six cards. The aim is to play a card that's higher than your opponents.&#10;&#10;If the bowler's card is higher,  a dot ball or a wicket happens. If the batter's card is higher, the batter scores that many runs or causes a wicket. Otherwise if tied, there is an automatic dot ball.&#10;&#10;The innings ends after a predetermined amount of overs, or ten wickets, then the players change sides. Standard cricket scoring rules decide who wins. A standard cricket scoresheet can be used to score the game.&#10;&#10;The card values are Ace to 4 scoring one run, 5 to 7 scoring two runs, 8 scoring three, 9 to 10 scoring a four, Jack and Queen scoring a six, and finally, a King being a wicket, no matter who plays it. You should shuffle after every 2 hands.&#10;&#10;There is also a solo mode which just simulates a game, where you only play the batting side which has been tested to be reasonably accurate to 20/20 cricket if you shuffle after every 4 overs. The scoring for this is Ace to 3 scoring dots, 4-6 scoring one run, 7 &amp; 8 scoring two runs, 9 scoring three runs, 10 and Jack scoring four runs, Queen scoring six runs, and King being a wicket.&#10;&#10;I must note that other people have probably created similar rules, and I do not claim to have invented the game, merely designed this particular variant. I made a mockup of the solo game in 2007 using GameMaker 7 and distributed that version amongst friends and family, and this ruleset is based on an evolution of said mockup.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
