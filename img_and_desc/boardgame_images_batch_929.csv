Mount Tai is of key importance in Chinese religion, being the eastern one of the five Sacred Mountains of China. According to historical records, Mount Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou Dynasty before 1,000 BC. A total of 72 emperors were recorded as visiting it. Writers also came to acquire inspiration, to compose poems, write essays, paint and take pictures. Hence, a great many cultural relics were left on the mountain. During the reign of Liu Che, Emperor Wu of Han, the Emperor has visited Mount Tai 8 times, praising the deities associated to this mountain.

They provide precious heat to the near freezing abyssal waters of the deep as well as a bounty of minerals. Microscopic archaea and other extremophiles live off the heat and minerals to form the base of a unique food chain that hosts a variety of exotic deep sea creatures.&#10;&#10;In Deep Vents, players each control their own hydrothermal ecosystem to which they add new life and geological features each turn, competing to survive in the unforgiving depths by being efficient and preying on nearby systems with a host of strange and deadly predators.&#10;&#10;Start each turn by drafting a tile from the five on display &mdash; placing one archaeon, the currency of the game &mdash; on each tile you skip. Place this tile adjacent to each other tile in your ecosystem, then either grow or trigger each tile in your ecosystem, moving through them from top to bottom, left to right, and growing or triggering them individually as you like. When you grow a tile, you place archaea on it, whether a set amount or a varying number depending on other tiles in your ecosystem; when you trigger a tile, you remove archaea from it to carry out its unique effect: attacking opponents, gaining shells to defend against attacks, moving archaea to your personal supply, and decimating tiles, which leaves them as nothing but a heat source for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;If you ever need to discard archaea due to an attack and cannot do so, you must take a shortfall token and ten archaea, then discard archaea as needed. On your turn, you can pay ten archaea to remove a shortfall token &mdash; which you want to do because as long as you have one, you can draft only the first tile on display. If you end your turn with two shortfall tokens, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends if only one player remains in play (with that player winning) or after eight rounds, with players scoring points for archaea and shells in reserve and archaea on tiles. In this case, whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The higher total wins the battle.&#10;&#10;Nineveh: No Mercy is based on true historical events.  Starting in 626 BC, a series of civil wars have weakened the Assyrian Empire, thus emboldening occupied territories to unite in rebellion to topple the Empire.  In No Mercy, the 22 red point cards represent the Assyrian army (The Wicked City of Nineveh being their capital), and the 33 blue point cards represent the coalition forces of the Babylonians, the Medes and the Persians.  The Assyrian forces are more skilled and valued at 11 points per card, coalition forces are more numerous but less skilled and valued at 7 points per card.  As the Assyrian general you command the 22 red point cards while your opponent commands the 33 blue point cards of the coalition forces.&#10;&#10;There will be a series of 11 battles and the player who wins most of these battles gains a victory point. In each of these 11 battles, the Assyrian general plays 2 red cards against the coalition general&rsquo;s 3 blue cards.  After each conflict consisting of 11 battles, the players switch armies/colors and become the new general of the opposing army.  The 1st player to win 2 victory points wins the War, thus ending the game.
