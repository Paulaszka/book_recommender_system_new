12646,,"The old IRC game,  Acrophobia made use of a similar core mechanism:  Generate a random string of letters, which the players regard as if it were an acronym.  Each player must then create an &quot;expansion&quot; for that acronym.  For example: BGGIA could inspire Board Game Geek Is Addictive, or Boring Guys Generally Inspire Aldie.  Players then vote for their favorite, and rewards are granted accordingly.&#10;&#10;In Acronymble, the reward comes in the form of movement along a traditional roll-and-move type of path, complete with &quot;move ahead&quot; and &quot;move back&quot; spaces; however some of the spaces also impose restrictions on the players thereupon, such as requiring their expansion to be a grammatical sentence.&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10;&#10;&quot;Because fun IS a laughing matter&quot;&#10;&#10;Welcome to the world of Acronymble! A world where anything can happen...and usually does!!! Where else could you meet &quot;(A) (H)erd (O)f (J)uggling (C)entipedes&quot; or a &quot;(F)abulously (F)rilly (F)rappe&quot;?!&#10;&#10;In Acronymble, you get 3-7 letters, and make up your own words to go with them. Write whatever comes to mind, because in Acronymble...anything goes!!! The only limit is your imagination, so let it run wild. Don't worry you'll catch up with it somewhere! Just sit back and enjoy the hilarity!!&#10;&#10;Of course Acronymble has a winner, but nobody loses because everyone has a great time!&#10;&#10;So put on your thinking caps, and unleash your inhibitions! Be an Acronymwit! You won't be sorry, unless you're allergic to laughter.&#10;&#10;"

It already has one supplement released - &quot;Freeplay '88&quot;, dealing with a NATO exercise in 1988.&#10;&#10;The game has been compared to &quot;Harpoon 4&quot;, perhaps unfairly, as while it covers the same topic (modern naval warfare), the aim is present a much more global scope.  Command of small fleets of ships is very easy in this game, as weapon effectiveness is determined by a single value and weapon damage is a single value (heavy, medium, light, etc).&#10;&#10;Ship damage are represented by a damage area with 4 damage levels - two 'lights', a 'heavy', and a 'critical' damage level.  When a weapon damages a ship, a d10 is rolled and the weapon's size is compared against the size of the target ship on a chart to see the resulting damage level (with a chance of 'none' being one of the levels).  If the given damage level is already called for, the next level up is used.  The net effect is as mirrored by hypothetical naval combat - ships take very few hits to be 'mission killed'.&#10;&#10;Detection is handled within the rules in a very basic way, although special note should be made of the submarine rules.  They make use of 'range bands' around a target ship.  Submarines are not placed on the 'board' unless detected, making their approach and attack on these 'range band' diagrams, essentially their exact position unknown to BOTH players - neatly avoiding the need for a third player as referee almost always required in other games of the type.&#10;&#10;The production values of the game are fairly high - no counters or maps are included, but, given the nature of most modern naval games to use miniatures or simply graph paper, that's certainly forgivable.  The game manual itself is printed on glossy paper with plenty of images throughout (several pages include color images) that really set the mood for the game.&#10;&#10;"

The more dubious the tax option, the greater the reward; however, it is the top card showing on your stack that will determine how you fare should a player call an audit on you. Choosing an &quot;Innocent&quot; card can offer sufficient advantage in an audit that you may choose to audit yourself, especially if your opponents have likewise followed this path.&#10;&#10;"

It includes scenarios for WWI, WWII, Angola, Vietnam, and the Boxer Rebellion. The scale is 1:1 skirmish.&#10;&#10;Arc of Fire (AoF) is intended for games employing forces up to company level, with from one squad to three platoons on each side using 10mm-28mm miniatures, often with armor or artillery support. One of the prime design goals of AoF was to find a level of detail that was fun and easy, but still captured the flavor of skirmish gaming. If rifle magazine capacities, tanks&rsquo; power-to-weight ratios, or the quantity of high explosive in particular shells are the type of factors you really want in a game, you should probably not be looking at this book. The basic assumption of AoF is that leadership, training, organization and motivation are more important than minor technological advantages in deciding who wins. By concentrating on these rather than on &lsquo;kit&rsquo;, AoF produces a fast and exciting game that is more realistic than many games that obsess about technical detail.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    The Face of Battle: The Hill Battles &#226;&#128;&#147; Khe Sanh, Vietnam: 1967&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Like Mousetrap, the gameboard is dominated (in fact, consists of) a large Rube Goldberg-ish contraption.  Players use a plastic &quot;putter&quot; to flick a small (about 1cm in diameter) ball around a nine-hole miniature golf course.  Some holes require the ball to roll into an elevator which carries it up and dumps it into a spiral track leading to the hole.  Others require the ball to be hit up a ramp into a basketball hoop or rebounded off bumpers.  One hole even consists of a dangling plastic chicken that swings back and forth pendulum-style (a little oil might be useful for this one as there's too much friction as-is for the chicken to swing freely.)  Players have three chances to play each hole.  Whoever sinks their putt in the fewest shots is awarded a token--no tokens awarded for ties.  The ninth hole has two holes, one harder to reach than the other.  Players are awarded one token for sinking their putt into the easy hole, or two for the hard one.  The player with the most tokens wins.&#10;&#10;"
