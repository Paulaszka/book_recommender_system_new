In the David and Goliath struggle that follows, the Russians swarm across the border and push back the Finns in victory after victory. The future appears grim for Finnish independence.&#10;&#10;Nowhere is the danger greater than in the central sector, where a Russian breakthrough would threaten the strongpoints of the Mannerheim Line. Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj&auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack...&#10;&#10;Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj&auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes many tried-and-true &quot;classic&quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.

This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single afternoon.  The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further increase playability.

Tournament and Campaign Edition (FR!TCE) differs from the standard FR!3 ruleset in the following manner:&#10;&#10;* The Morale Clock starts at 7.&#10;    * Capabilities diminish when the clock reaches 3.&#10;    * No unit RF/CF can be raised by magic or character bonuses by more than +2. Only rank and file units can have a magic or character RF/CF bonus, not Special units (except Large Monsters, when ridden).&#10;    * Large Monsters (including dragons and leviathans) and Spirits usually require a pip to move (unless ridden).&#10;    * There is only one simplified level of magic.&#10;    * The character system has also been simplified, with some differences from FR!3. Note: These new concepts are compatible with FR!3 (for example, you might wish to use the FR!3 TCE Witch Hunter capabilities instead of the original FR!3 ones).&#10;    * FR!3 optional rules are not part of FR!TCE, and unit/character lists have been streamlined.&#10;    * There are no specific army lists. Instead, we have sixteen Army Focuses; these are special character and unit core competencies in which an armies/races/civilizations might specialize. Each army picks 3-4. For example, if the Orcs in your world are noble knights or steppe riders, then you can set up the lists to accomodate.&#10;    * There is a hierarchy of units (raised, regular, veteran, and elite) to simulate campaign experience (for example, Mounted are raised, Heavy Cavalry are regular, and Knights, Light Cavalry, and Heavy Chariots are veteran).&#10;&#10;FR!TCE is designed to be played in under an hour since fast, simple play is essential for conventions, campaigns and tournaments, evening play, or to just have a simplified game to introduce beginners to miniature wargame rules. In doing so, we have not sacrificed tactics, skill, or interesting variety; our players get to fight the battle, not the rules. FR!3 and FR!TCE are designed for use with 10mm, 15mm, or 25mm armies.&#10;&#10;These rules are designed to be used in the fantasy or mythical world of your choice, not one that we have designed. All Chipco games emphasize playing with whatever armies or figures you have already, and FR!TCE is no exception.&#10;&#10;"

On paper, the Red force allocations seemed to guarantee victory by 4 to 1 and more. Hundreds of tanks, artillery and aircraft were opposed by weak Finnish forces, many of them at only 50% strength. Only a few Finnish divisions opposed over 15 Red divisions at full strength.The Finns were clearly worried and rightly so, as when the Red offensive began in late June, one Finnish defensive line crumbled after another! The only equalizer was the terrain mostly of forests and lakes. The few key roads channeled any offensive plans. By the 28th of June, the Finns had already sounded the SOS call to the Germans for help. Hitler sent in the Luftwaffe, StG 303, and hundreds of Panzerfausts and Panzerschrecks. The Red steamroller stalled, started and inched closely to Ihantala, the last Finn defenses. When July arrived, Ihantala was threatened. The Finns were close to collapse-but would they?&#10;&#10;"

It is played on a 9x9 grid, traditionally on a shogi board. The word dai mean large and the name is apt because this game uses twice as many pieces as Hasami Shogi, 18 per player placed initially on the two back rows nearest the player controlling those pieces. The two sides are called sente [&quot;black&quot;] and gote [&quot;white&quot;], as in shogi, with sente moving first. Traditionally, Go-stones are used for the pieces.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture all of an opponents' pieces or to have captured more pieces than one's opponent if a situation arises in which additional captures are no longer possible. All pieces move like rooks is chess, i.e., in any uninterrupted vertical or horizontal line in any obstructed direction without jumping. Pieces are taken by custodial capture, i.e., when an enemy piece becomes horizontally or vertically sandwiches between two of a player's own pieces. One of the two pieces bracketing the captured piece must be moved in order to capture but multiple simultaneous captured are allowed.&#10;&#10;The game is a member of the petteia or lantruculorum family of games. A similar game is played in Thailand and in , where respectively it is called Mak-yes and Apit-sodok; this game differs only in that the second row of pieces starts on the third rather than the second row.&#10;&#10;"

Berg, covering two of the Duke&rsquo;s great victories in the War of the Spanish Succession: Ramillies, a massive cavalry clash, and Malplaquet, a hue infantry battle. The period in which Marlborough fought was a transition between the musket-and-pike era and the more fluid, if still massed, tactics that emerged with Frederick the Great. The key transitional mechanic was the invention of the socket bayonet, which allowed gun-armed infantry to use their weapon for shock as well as fire combat. The battles fought in the War of the Spanish Succession were the first major engagements in which that innovation was used, and the commanders hadn&rsquo;t yet learned to appreciate its value. Warfare in that era was therefore mostly still formalized, rigid and stolid.&#10;&#10;The map scale is 225 yards per hex. Each double-length infantry unit is composed of, on an average, four battalions and contains about 2,000 to 3,000 tightly packed men. The square infantry counters (for use in Malplaquet) each represent about half that number. Cavalry units each contain about five or six squadrons, about 600 mounted men. Artillery units each represent 12 to 18 guns. There is no per-turn time scale, as there are no distinct game turns. The game simply starts and then keeps going until one player wins. To accomplish that the system uses a &ldquo;continuation activation&rdquo; mechanic.&#10;&#10;"

The campaign under examination is &ldquo;Operation Bagration,&rdquo; the Red Army&rsquo;s summer offensive of 1944 during which they destroyed more German manpower and equipment than had been lost at Stalingrad.&#10;&#10;Without question a one-sided affair in terms of which side is &lsquo;shaping the battlefield&rsquo; and &lsquo;controlling the tempo,&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve managed to make things more interesting for both players by broadening the map to cover not only Byelorussia, but all of the Baltic Republics as well as the northwest Ukraine. That expansion gives both players more interesting options and strategies in terms of how to pursue victory.&#10; Each hex on the 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map equals 16 miles (26 kilometers).

The latter&rsquo;s great airpower advantage is represented in the form of 10 &ldquo;air armies.&rdquo; There are 176 large-size unit-counters included, most done in NATO-style, but also with iconic markers. The system is an adaptation of the one used in issue number three&rsquo;s Bulge, which means two experienced players can finish a match in about three to four hours.&#10;&#10;The historical scenario provides exact set ups for both sides, but there are also free-deployment options. The &ldquo;Bold Stroke&rdquo; scenario allows the Soviet player to try the approach the Germans were expecting: putting the weight of the offensive in the western Pripyat Marsh and driving straight for Koenigsberg. Other options allow the investigation of such historical &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; as the failure of the Western Allies&rsquo; D-Day landing or no July bomb plot against Hitler.&#10;&#10;"

After the failure of Hitler&rsquo;s counterattack in early August to halt the Allied breakout from Normandy, the German 7th and 5th Panzer Armies found themselves on the verge of being pocketed by converging American and British pincers. On the evening of August 16th the Germans began to pull back behind the Orne and Dives rivers, hoping to regroup for a defense of the Seine, even as the Allies attempted to close the trap on some twentyfive German divisions. Ultimately, about half the German forces in the pocket escaped, leaving almost all their heavy equipment behind. It was a major Allied victory, but not a war-winning one.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Gulf War in '91, cable TV news was full of horrific photos from the &quot;Highway of Death,&quot; the route back to Iraq from Kuwait that seemed, almost literally, to be &quot;paved&quot; with burnt-out vehicles. Those who study WWII remember similar destruction... on the road out of the Falaise Pocket... where 25 German divisions raced for survival, while the Allied armies aimed to turn Hitler's delayed counterattack on Normandy from failure to war-ending disaster. In one sense, neither side succeeded. But the devastation was something unprecedented.&#10;&#10;Now, you have a chance to do better. The Pocket at Falaise puts each player in the difficult position of trying to overcome the obstacles, both human and mechanical, tactical and operational, that interfered with success in 1944. Award-winning designer Ted Racier explains:&#10;&#10;The story of the Falaise battle is that of two German armies trying to escape a trap set for them by their own high command, and of the Allied armies trying to close the trap, despite the hesitations and divisions of their own higher commanders.&#10;&#10;While we may think of the Allies as having overwhelming forces, at the actual point of contact, there were relatively weak units trying to &quot;plug the leak&quot; against overwhelming numbers of intensely motivated Germans. The situation means that the &quot;retreating&quot; Germans are actually forced to do a lot of attacking, while the &quot;advancing&quot; allies found themselves in a desperate defense. The Pocket at Falaise uses a chit-pull activation system to capture some of the chaotic and uncoordinated efforts. Players are forced to juggle to make the best out of an increasingly difficult situation, and a combat scale that straddles &quot;tactical&quot; and &quot;operational,&quot; aiming to capture the best of both without adding a lot of fiddly rules. A complete set of solitaire rules for the game completes the package.&#10;&#10;Eisenhower called it, &quot;The Great Killing Ground.&quot; What the Germans called it cannot be printed.

Rock platforms (ahus) are where the Moa&iuml;s (monumental sculptures) will be erected.&#10;&#10;Your clan competes against others, and you will earn more prestige by building and transporting larger, more imposing Moa&iuml;s than your opponents' clans.&#10;&#10;Each of your pawns represents a group of men. You can grow your population if you wish. You will choose each turn which part of your population will sculpt Moa&iuml;s and which other part will transport them, in cooperation with other players.&#10;&#10;Statues are transported from the quarry to the ahus (the rock platforms) using paths made of pawns and the help of logs.&#10;&#10;You can use your influence (Tribal Markers) to choose the best statues and mark to your color the statues you cannot achieve in your turn. You can also rely on your Sorcerer and his mighty powers, of the strength of your Chief, as well as on mystic powers of the Rongo writing tablets.&#10;&#10;The winner will be the one who has erected the largest statues in the best places at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Note that there is a Official Rule Change for this game : For the final scoring, complete Rongo tablets are no longer scored and do not earn any points to the players.&#10;&#10;"

A parchment manuscript has just been discovered, revealing the location of its gates. The city&rsquo;s immense riches described in the manuscript have inspired much desire and greed.&#10;&#10;As the head of a team of explorers and mercenaries, you have set up camp in the Paleo Archipelago. But other teams have also arrived at the scene.&#10;Protected by your mercenaries, your explorers are ready to launch a search for the keys that will give access to the city. It is up to you to take advantage of the archipelago&rsquo;s many reefs in order to stay ahead of your competitors.&#10;---&#10;In the basic two-player version of Paleo, players set up the 65 x 65 cm board with four central reefs, two sanctuaries for each player in the corners of the board, and five supplemental reefs placed according to various rules. Each player controls a team of five explorers and three mercenaries; you move these pieces by flicking them with your finger as in Crokinole. If your mercenary hits an opponent&rsquo;s piece, that piece is removed from the board; remove all of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces, and you win the round and score one point.&#10;&#10;The explorers are used to enter the opponent&rsquo;s sanctuaries and recover two keys that then allow the player to enter the gate of Paleo in the center of the board. (Any of your pieces that enters a sanctuary can be exchanged for another piece already captured by the opponent.) This victory is worth two points, and a complete game requires a player to earn four points to win.&#10;&#10;Rules are included to accommodate three or four players, in addition to rules for ten other games for 2-4 players such as hockey, a kayak race, and Capture the King.&#10;&#10;"

As the Spanish player you will need to determine where you will build your siege gun redoubts and will then have to protect your soldiers from raiding British units to finish the works in time to mount an effective bombardment. As the British player, you have far fewer forces, but armed with special raiding rules, your Regulars, Tories and Indian allies must harass and erode Spanish morale, while delaying the construction of Spanish siege works for as long as possible in the hope of keeping your three forts intact to face the coming coup de main.&#10;&#10;The game begins with Don Bernardo de Galvez&rsquo;s army of 5,000 having just landed on the mainland. How many forces actually are present is decided in a special phase during the initial set-up wherein that portion of the Spanish army that sailed from Havana must run the gauntlet of the Red Cliffs Fort guns. Hence, the starting forces for Spain are likely to be different for each game played as units and leaders are eliminated or delayed in their arrival. Once these forces are ashore, the Spanish player faces some hard choices. Does he send forces to take out the Red Cliffs Fort, to protect his turn 7 Spanish and French reinforcements from having to run the same gauntlet, or does the Spanish player immediately begin construction of the siege works, to achieve the longest possible bombardment before the coup de main?&#10;&#10;The British player is outnumbered, but must employ his small forces in aggressive and often risky raids to slow down siege construction, wear down Spanish morale and worry the Spanish lines of supply. Getting a small force into one of two Spanish stockades can be devastating for the Spanish. Thus, though numerically superior, the Spanish player has much to do and protect, and will often be spread thin by a well-conceived series of raids. Giving the Spanish too many siege turns to bombard your three forts and/or permitting the Spanish to launch the coup de main with high army morale is likely to spell disaster for the British player.&#10;&#10;"
