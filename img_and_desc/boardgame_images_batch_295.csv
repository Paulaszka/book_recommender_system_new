The players try to make the longest snake.Serpentino is a Dutch game for younger children. There are two ways of playing, one more suited to very young kiddies.&#10;&#10;The 54 cards are used, to form seven snakes. Four of the snakes have seven parts to their body plus a head and a tail, whilst three other snakes have four parts to their body plus, again, a head and a tail.&#10;&#10;Four children can play the simpler game. The cards are shuffled and placed face-down in a stack. In his turn, a player takes the top card and if it is a head, he places it in front of him. Now, on future turns, another card is drawn. If it is a body part, it is added to the head and so on. The idea is to for each player to make a snake as long as possible after drawing a head, but if a tail is drawn, that completes the snake and a new snake must be 'started' by drawing another head card. Unusable cards are discarded and are shuffled once the draw pile has been exhausted. The winner is the player who has made the most snakes or, as an alternative, the player who has made the longest snake.&#10;&#10;The slightly more difficult game only uses the four snakes with nine parts. A single child can probably have fun just making snakes, perhaps consisting of a head, 40 body parts and a tail.&#10;&#10;"

Players determine the amount of coins in 8 stacks as well as the maximum movement (slide) along the grid by secretly writing down numbers and adding them together. The player to move the final piece into the 9th box (Home) is the winner.&#10;&#10;From Gladstone&rsquo;s Games to Go:&#10;&#10;Part of the appeal of Sliders is the strange sense of ritual at the beginning of the game.  Secret numbers are scrawled, then revealed, and finally, a miniature landscape of towers is constructed.  If you play in public, casual observers will first be mystified, then drawn to you.  Be prepared to let others in on the fun!&#10;&#10;"

The ground scale is 1 inch equals fifteen yards. There is no specific time scale per turn.&#10;&#10;Protz' rules provide a great deal of flavor to the period of Cavaliers and Roundheads. The foot (infantry) regiments, which combine pikemen and musketeers, are arranged in a logical way that allows for easy use of the two types within the same unit. The foot can assume a number of specified &quot;postures&quot; or formations that affect their fighting ability against certain opponents. For example, foot in &quot;close order&quot; or &quot;ring&quot; fight better against opposing horse (cavalry).&#10;&#10;The horse also has specified postures, such as the caracole, which is a deep formation intended to attack by firing pistols in successive ranks. Horse also has a unique movement restriction where they must move by one of three speeds: trot, canter, or gallop. The horse must accelerate turn-by-turn to get up to galloping speed. The speed makes a great deal of difference when fighting other horse. The faster troops have the advantage. This is a nice touch and provides a game mechanic for a situation that is often mentioned in accounts of the era.&#10;&#10;Some of the game's mechanics are cumbersome. For example, &quot;Giving fire with small arms&quot; requires nine steps; firing artillery requires 10 steps. However, these rules are still very playable. The second edition (published 1976) adds several pages of rules for siege warfare as well as clarifications and revisions of first edition rules.&#10;&#10;"

The rules first appeared as a series of articles in Tradition magazine, a UK production aimed at painters of miniature soldiers. The published version is a 191-page hardcover book.&#10;&#10;The era covered by the rules is vaguely the Seven Years War, generally known as the &quot;Horse and Musket&quot; era. One interesting feature of the game is that rather than strictly portray the historical era, The War Game invites creating fictional armies of the period so players can give their own grandiloquent names to their units and paint them using their own uniform designs.&#10;&#10;The scales used for the game are pretty fuzzy. The miniatures are used singly, i.e., not mounted in multiples on a base as in most miniature wargames. An infantry brigade of two regiments is roughly 100 single figures. Maneuvering your units can be tedious, but it's easy to adopt any formation.&#10;&#10;The War Game not only provides a set of rules, but each chapter provides a great deal of philosophy behind the rule with the actual game mechanics stated simply at the end. For example, the actual rules for moving infantry are very simple, but Grant takes four pages, with a lot of reasoning and reference to historical sources, to come to them.&#10;&#10;The War Game is far from concise. However, it's not just a set of rules, it's a great read from one of miniature wargaming's founders.&#10;&#10;"

The nature of the war at that time was very fluid and hadn't settled into the static trench warfare that characterized the war in modern memory.&#10;&#10;The basic units of the game are the infantry company, cavalry squadron, and half-battery. These basic units are combined into larger units such as battalions, regiments, brigades, and batteries. There are no set scales for distance or time.&#10;&#10;Great War uses increment cards that determine how many actions a player can make in their turn. Cards number from one to three. The composition of a card deck varies by nationality, but is always eight cards. Countries rated to have better command control will have more &quot;3s&quot; in their deck and a higher total of increments. The cards are drawn each turn and reshuffled after the deck has been gone through.&#10;&#10;Command control is simulated by a commander having to allocate command factors to every unit he wishes to move or fire in the turn. When the game starts, the commander has one command factor available per unit. However, as units lose or win melees, capture key positions, or rout, the command factors will rise and fall so that a commander may be unable to move all his units in a turn. The commander MUST allocate command factors to attempt to unpin any units that have become pinned due to enemy fire.&#10;&#10;Firing uses an incremental percentage. A unit has a base percentage value for their fire, which is multiplied by the number of figures firing and then by the number of increments. For example, a rifle company of six figures firing at long range (15&quot;) for two increments has a base factor of 10%, which is multiplied times the figures to get 60%, and then multiplied by the number of increments for a result of 120% or one casualty inflicted and a 20% chance for a second. Cover modifiers may also reduce a unit's fire. For example, if the target of the rifle company's fire had been entrenched, the fire would be reduced to 1/4 for a result of a 30% chance for a single casualty.&#10;&#10;Small arms fire is from unit to unit, but artillery fire uses templates that cover a larger area and may embrace multiple target units, all of which are affected by the fire. Casualties can mount rapidly, especially when artillery fire comes into play.&#10;&#10;Infantry, cavalry, artillery--and machine guns--are the dominant arms in Great War, but early armored vehicles, such as armored cars, were on hand and are included in the game.&#10;&#10;Great War includes organization charts for all the countries of 1914 along with guidelines for basing figures and models.&#10;&#10;The game plays quickly even with a large number of units per side. There is enough &quot;flavor&quot; to make the rules engaging without so much detail that one feels bogged down in minutiae.&#10;&#10;"

Minus cards moves any other chariot backwards the number of spaces as shown on the card.  Plus cards moves your chariot forwards that number of spaces.  Normal cards moves your chariot forwards based on the difference between the number on your card and the lowest number played.  If a player had played a normal card but had a minus card played against him then he cannot move forward that turn at all.&#10;&#10;When all 8 cards are played another set of 8 cards are dealt to all players.  The game ends when one player reaches the finishing post.&#10;&#10;The game supports UK National Curriculum Key Stages I and II for History.&#10;&#10;

These rules borrow many of their mechanisms from the Wargames Research Ancients rules. The scale is 1 figure equals 20 men, one inch equals ten yards, and one turn equals approximately 30 seconds of elapsed time.&#10;&#10;Troop types are classified by armor protection, formation, social order and experience, and weapons. For example, an 11th century Norman knight would be classified as HC (heavy cavalry), Order (slightly loose formation), K (knights, very high on the social/experience scale), and light lance (used overarm, not couched).&#10;&#10;One interesting aspect of the rules is that it includes a section of guidelines for modifying troop performance based on campaign factors. For example, if troops have force marched, been previously defeated by their opponent, are out of supply, they will suffer minus factors to their die rolls for testing morale, missile fire, and melee resolution.&#10;&#10;The rules include four pages of army lists that provide sample ratings for troop types by nationality.&#10;&#10;Despite being almost 40 years old, God's Acre is still a good game system based on solid &quot;Old School&quot; mechanics for miniature gaming.&#10;&#10;"
