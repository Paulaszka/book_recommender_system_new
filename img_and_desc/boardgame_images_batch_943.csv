Players are magistrates sent to a newly conquered province to build cities and help spread Roman influence in the area. By employing clever planning, they must grow their cities to meet the demands of incoming settlers, as well as build imposing Monuments to please their emperor.&#10;&#10;Competitive Objective:&#10;To win, players must build impressive Monuments and fill their city with incoming settlers. Monuments have unique scoring bonus that will only apply to the city they are built in, while claiming settlers unlocks the point value they are covering. &#10;  At the end of the game, players will add up their scores and the player with the most victory points is declared the winner. This player is awarded governorship of the province with their city being named its new capital.&#10;&#10;Cooperative Objective:&#10;The emperor wants to increase the efficiency and profit of each of his provinces. As a group of magistrates you must work together to ensure your province doesn&rsquo;t displease him, which would result with you losing your position&mdash;and your possibly your head.&#10;Follow the emperor&rsquo;s Edict, complete his preferred Monuments, and plan carefully to make sure you all stay off the chopping block!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Somewhere in a remote desert, an ancient tomb has been disturbed. An evil spirit has woken and is threatening to the whole world with an act of revenge. &#10;  You as a player need to save the world. The world counts on you! You must put bricks back on a tomb. Do it first, and you are the winner!!! &#10;  Game is played by 2 &ndash; 6 people, ages 7+. At the start, each player is given 5 playing cards, for which can be acquired bricks from the Brickbank. The bricks have different shapes and correspond to the color of the card. Amount paid for each brick can be the same as the price or higher. If brick is bought for its stated nominal value, a player can make an additional move. If paid by the nominal, it can be bought as many bricks as laying on the Brickbank (not from the treasury storage). After the player&rsquo;s turn is over, every time empty brick spots on the Brickbank must be covered by new bricks.&#10;  First move on the game is given to the player with highest value card. If several players have similar highest cards, they are comparing their next highest cards until someone has an upper hand.  &#10;  On players turn, can be made one of the following:&#10;-    Card drawn from the stock&#10;-    Brick bought from the Brickbank&#10;-    Brick removed /replaced. * if a row is completed, no brick can be removed or replaced.  &#10;  Seems too easy? Not so fast, my friend. Competition is quite hard, and players need to come up with some strategy in order to succeed. Here are some hurdles: &#10;-    Although some bricks stretch up to the next rows, which is acceptable, player cannot build next row without completely bricklaying preceding one.&#10;-    You have laid almost all bricks and now have stuck for some particular piece: don&rsquo;t have necessary currency to buy this exact brick? Think strategy again: maybe you don&rsquo;t need to cover up row too fast before you acquire necessary resources from the Brickbank. You need to be good at reading patterns. &#10;-    First move always starts from the left bottom corner marked with red. Next moves can be done freely, but within the same row until it is filled and ready to move to the upper one.  &#10; Good luck!!!&#10;  Notice: Game is claimed strategic, and it truly is. In order to win, players must plan their movements in advance. The higher up the pyramid player climbs, the fewer choices one has and has to be very careful. Game is well suitable for school children to develop strategic thinking, to learn better geometrical shapes, and learn to count. Game is fun for adults also and is not burdening with the time required- just about 30 minutes to play one round. Quite addictive: lost players want a replay to get the satisfaction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

You can arrange the cards anywhere. The number and type of cards depends on the chosen Scenario. A player can look at their cards whenever they want during the course of the game.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE: The player who first eliminates all the Snipers of the rival team or who first reaches the Objective Points of the chosen Scenario wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;BASIC GAME:Two players alternate turns during the game. In a turn, each player must perform only one of the following two actions:&#10;&#10;MOVE: the player takes the 4 cards of any Quadrant (group of 2&times;2 Area Cards) from their Front, and rearrange them as they wish in the same Quadrant.&#10;&#10;SEARCH: The player reveals an enemy Area Card. If the card contains a Sniper or Unit, the player can Shoot and eliminate it.&#10;&#10;If you decide to Shoot, remove the Area Card and place it in your scoring zone. Then, place your Shot Card in the center of a Quadrant of your Front where there is at least one Sniper. The removed card is replaced by an Empty Area card of the same Front.

Poland returned to the map of Europe only two months earlier. Now the Republic desperately needs reforms which can be carried out only by Sejm. Even though the country doesn't even have its borders set up, the Chief of State calls for democratic election which will allow to choose the Representatives of the whole society. It's time for the first election campaign of the Second Polish Republic!&#10;&#10;&quot;Wybory 1919&quot; is a dynamic boardgame in which the players are the leaders of four main political forces in the interwar Poland. They try to lead their parties to victory in the upcoming elections. By playing action cards, they compete for support in four main social groups: peasantry, city dwellers, workers and the minorities. They can increase their own popularity and place a supporter meeple in their color in one of the groups, decrease others' support, manipulate the regional elections' order or even cancel elections in some constituencies by calling in the military actions in the region. Each player gets an identical deck of 9 action cards at the start of the game, but draws up to the limit of three cards at random in their turn - reshuffling the discard pile if the draw pile runs out. Players need to strategize based on their current hand and pay attention to the cards that their opponents have already used.&#10;&#10;Whoever gets the majority in each of the three groups favoured in the current round's constituency, wins the seat for their representative in that round of elections. The party that gets more representatives than any of the others after the last round is resolved, wins the game and assists in writing the Second Polish Republic's history!&#10;&#10;The game was commissioned by the Social Communication Bureau at Chancellery of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland for the 100th anniversary of the first elections in Second Polish Republic. It's meant as an educational tool in teaching history and promotional item for the Sejm. As such, it hasn't been available in retail. The instructions booklet contains more detailed historical background on the elections of 1919-1920 in Poland. The action cards provide some basic information on the leaders of each political side as well as flavor texts in the form of newspaper quotes from that time.&#10;&#10;"

Once a card has been selected, players pass the remaining cards clockwise, then choose whether to add the newly acquired card to their tableau OR to discard the card in order to run their engine and cast their spells.

The official goal is to collect the most points over ten rounds of play. The real goal is to finally have an excuse to ask your friend's the questions you've never asked before.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, a question card is drawn that has a blank. (e.g. &quot;How often do you _____?&quot;). Each player writes a prompt on a piece of paper that fills in the blank to make a complete question (e.g. &quot;wake up before your alarm&quot;, &quot;cry&quot;, or &quot;fart and blame it on someone else&quot;). All the prompts get shuffled, and each player draws a prompt. Each player answers the prompt they drew (which is sometimes the one they wrote). After everyone has answered, a voting card is revealed and the players vote for the winning answer based on the criteria on the voting card. (One round the voting might be based on which answer is &quot;Most likely to disappoint your parents&quot; and the next round might be based on who gave the &quot;Most wholesome answer&quot;). The winning answer gets the voting card, which is worth a point. However, great answers are made in response to great questions. The author of the prompt that spurred the winning answer will receive a reward card. Then a new round begins.&#10;&#10;If you don't want to answer a question, you can take a penalty card, but you might have to answer more questions later. Reward cards can do anything from telling someone else to get you a drink to letting you pick who answers which questions. Use your reward cards wisely, but don't forget to use them.&#10;&#10;The game is concluded after 10 Question Cards/rounds have been completed (or really, however many you want to play!) The player with the most victory points is the winner.&#10;&#10;The cards are minimalist and each deck has it's own color (white, black, and orange). There is nothing inherently dirty about this game, but you can make it very adult/mature if you'd like. You also could play with kids and grandparents at a family reunion and ask family friendly questions. The maturity level of the game depends on the prompts that are written.&#10;&#10;"

The choice is yours as you spread your influence across the floating lands.&#10;&#10;Defiant is a 4X bag-building game set in a land of floating islands and battling dinosaurs.&#10;&#10;Each turn you will use the cubes you drew (at the end of the previous turn) to activate actions. Each action requires 2 cubes and will increase in power if you are willing to spend your rare bronze, silver, or even gold cube to complete the action. Be sure to plan ahead or your previously placed cubes could end up wasted.&#10;&#10;Air battles occur when 2 sets of flyers encounter each other. Transported raptors &amp; rexes add nothing to these battles. Only the number &amp; strength of each army's flyers matter. If the attacking flyers win, they may then drop their land units onto the island below.&#10;&#10;These dropped units will then instigate a land battle if defenders are present. These battles are more tricky, with secret modifier cards influencing each side's strength.&#10;&#10;A player may be strong in the air, but weak on land, unable to take over defended islands.

We aimed to build a 4X game that could be played quicker than a normal 4X game, yet still have the same scope and feel. The bag building element helps in this endeavor, as players can be planning their turns from 1 turn to the next (since they've already drawn the next turn's cubes).&#10;&#10;Note: Hardcore 4X gamers can choose to play to a higher objective thresh-hold for an even more sprawling and vast game of Defiant.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Scenarios are inspired by (however loosely players want), and must reference, a phrase created by 5 cards: 2 Link Cards and 3 Story Cards. These cards change between rounds.&#10;&#10;Each turn, one player takes on the role of judge and all other players take on the role of storytellers. The judge determines whether they want to hear the best or worst possible scenario and indicate by flipping the &quot;What If&hellip;&quot; card to its positive or negative side. They draw the top two cards of the Link deck and play them face up. They then play a Story card from their own hand to begin the scenario. Storytellers play Story cards from their hands to supply options for 2 of the words in the phrase. These 2 words are different for each storyteller, meaning they&rsquo;ll base their scenarios off slightly different phrases.&#10;&#10;At the end of the turn, roles shift. The player to the left of the previous judge becomes the new judge. Each turn consists of three phases: judge&rsquo;s setup, storyteller&rsquo;s scenarios, and judge&rsquo;s choice. Play continues until every player has had a chance to be judge twice &mdash; or keep going as long as you want! The game can be ended after any judge&rsquo;s choice phase.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Miners, knights, and sell-swords have all fallen at the claws of these foul creatures. With the Kingdom of Yule already on the verge of bankruptcy, the King cannot afford to lose control of these mines. No amount of death can stop his desire to retain his power.Lucky for you, your reputation as a Bounty Hunter has earned you a chance to prove your worth. Capturing criminals has been easy, surely your unique skill set will transfer to killing beasts. The King is willing to empty the last of the kingdom's coffers for the heads of these creatures. Will you fall amongst the treasure and corpses of the cavern or slay your enemies to claim your due glory?&quot;&#10;&#10;Dungeon Bounty is a fast paced hand management game designed to be played with a single standard deck of playing cards. On each turn, players flip two cards from the deck (dungeon). If the cards are a 1-10 of clubs (weapons), diamonds (gemstones), or spades (spells), the player chooses one to add to their play area. Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are the bounties, the creatures you are hunting, and when they pop up as one of the two drawn cards from the dungeon, you need to defeat them using your attack power from weapons and spells. The more bounties you collect, the higher your score.&#10;&#10;If you are unable to defeat a monster, they do damage to you, reducing your strength, which is represented by the 1-10 of hearts. If you are at 1 strength and are damaged by an enemy, you lose. If you manage to stay alive, the game ends after two trips through the dungeon. After you've depleted the deck the first time, you shuffle the discard pile and play through the deck a second time. Compare your score to the scoring guide and see your destiny.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Paint/Roll your way to the next masterpiece!&#10;Players: 1 - 100+&#10;Game Time: 20 minutes&#10;Items needed: 5 six-sided dice&#10;        Optional - Markers/Crayons/Pencils of the 6 colors to make your work of art beautiful (Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red)&#10;&#10;Setup: Determine the End Goals for this game. Roll a die for each of the three end goals (A, B, C). These three goals are how to earn points from your painting, the other goals that were not rolled are ignored for this game.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 12 rounds, with players playing simultaneously, trying to earn the most points. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Each Round you will Roll 5 dice and then use the dice to mark two numbers on your painting and also gain a bonus. From the 5 dice, two of those dice will be used to place a number on your painting, then another two dice will be used to place another number on your painting, and the 5th die will be used to gain the corresponding bonus. These markings can be done in any order.&#10;&#10;- Roll 5 dice - Roll the 5 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference.&#10;&#10;- Use dice for painting two numbers and gaining a bonus&#10;In any order, do these three actions without using the same die more than once:&#10;&#10;Paint a number in a square - use two dice, one for the placement location and the other for the number/paint color used. &#10;    Example: You choose a die with a 1 and a die with a 3. You use the 1 for the placement location, so the number placed will need to be in one of the unused squares in the &ldquo;1&rdquo; grid. You choose the 3 as the number/paint color used in that square. You write a 3 in one of the open squares in the 1 grid.&#10;    If you there are no available squares in a die&rsquo;s location, you may not choose that.&#10;&#10;Paint a number in a square - Do this again, same as above. You must use dice that have not been used.&#10;&#10;Gain a Bonus - use a die to gain one of the three bonuses. Use a 1 or 2 to gain a &ldquo;+/- 1&rdquo; to use now or later, use a 3 or 4 to gain a &ldquo;place anywhere&rdquo; to use now or later, and use a 5 or 6 to gain a Star. Each star is worth 1 point at the end of the game and gives no other bonus.&#10;&#10;Reminder: you can do these three actions in any order. There are times when gaining the bonus first allows you to paint a more helpful square for your painting.&#10;&#10;Repeat this each round (rolling 5 dice and using those 5 dice) until 12 rounds have been completed.&#10;&#10;Important Note: If you ever cannot place one of your numbers on your painting, mark an X anywhere you choose in a square on your painting. Each X&rsquo;ed space on your painting is negative 1 point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Using your Bonuses: You may use your bonuses at any time during the game. When you gain a bonus, circle it. When used, cross it off to show it has been used. You may spend multiple bonuses in the same round. As your painting fills up, it becomes more difficult to place your numbers. It can be especially helpful to save some bonuses to use in the last rounds of the game.&#10;&#10;Using +/- 1 Dice Bonus: When used, you may increase or decrease one of the dice numerically by one. This can be used to change a die to help with placing the die, the number/color of the die, or for gaining a bonus.&#10;&#10;Using Place Anywhere Bonus: When used, you may use one of your dice to place the number of another die anywhere. &#10;    Example: You have a 1 and a 3 for placement and number/color. All of your squares are filled in your &ldquo;1 grid&rdquo; and your &ldquo;3 grid&rdquo;. You spend a Place Anywhere bonus to change your 1 die to a Place Anywhere. You then choose to place the number/color 3 in the 5 grid, where it is advantageous for your end goals and where there is also an available square.&#10;&#10;Star Bonus: Each star is worth 1 point at the end of the game and gives no other bonus. You&rsquo;re a star!&#10;&#10;Each End Goal Explained:&#10;End Goal A: Earn points for matching shapes of the same number/color. The orientation of the shape can be mirrored and/or flipped in any way, as long as it is the same shape. You cannot use the same number twice for shapes. You can use these numbers for B and C end goals&#10;End Goal B: Earn points for each pair of these numbers anywhere on your painting. These two numbers do not need to be connected. Example: You have placed three 1&rsquo;s and five 2&rsquo;s in your painting. You have three pairs (set of 1&amp;2, 1&amp;2, and 1&amp;2), so you earn 6 points; 2 per pair.&#10;End Goal C: This goal is looking at unique numbers in either rows, columns, or grids. If you fulfill this goal in multiple rows/columns/grids, you score each time it is fulfilled.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;After you have completed the 12th roll/round, total your points earned from each End Goal, one point for each Star bonus, and subtract one point for each X on your painting (unpainted squares). The player with the most points is the winner!&#10;&#10;Look at your amazing masterpiece and name it and autograph it.&#10;&#10;For those who want to take it to the next level: When marking numbers, you can use coordinating colors (color key in top left of page). After finishing, you can fill in the boxes completely with the corresponding colors to beautify your work of art.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"
