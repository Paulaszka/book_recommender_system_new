Players draw resources to form a hand of 6 cards and they spend these resources (Wood, Stone, Iron, Laborer, Carpenter, Mason, and Gold) to purchase portions of a building. These portions come in the form of tiles that can be used to construct medieval buildings. Completed buildings score players points. Incomplete buildings are worth far less.&#10;&#10;In addition there are also special cards that allow players to perform additional actions. These cards include characters such as the Baron, the Scoundrel, and the Merchant.&#10;&#10;"

No rock next to meadows, and no mountain tops next to forest or meadows. A few special tiles (the passes) have to match their sides exactly.&#10;&#10;With your pawn (a hiker with backpack) you move around the placed tiles, visiting those that have special items printed on them (animals, flowers, waterfalls, etc.), and avoiding those with bears. By visiting special places, you collect a victory points card (usually 2 points) for that special place (for a bear however, you get -3 points). There are three items in each category, and collecting the full set earns you a bonus of 5 points.&#10;&#10;Each turn you have two free actions available, to either move, or place a Rifugio (a mountian cabin). Each time an opponent visits a tile with your Rifugio, you get a card with 2 victory points, but they too rest (which is getting a card with an extra action they can use at any time convenient).&#10;&#10;Game ends when all tiles have been placed, and whoever gathered the most points in collecting those cards wins.&#10;&#10;"

Each card bears a symbol &ndash; Rock, Paper, Scissors, Bomb &ndash; that makes the deck ideal for fans of Live Action Role Playing (as they often need some randomizing element during play).&#10;&#10;What's more, each card contains one or more unique (and sometimes hidden) symbols, which allows the deck to be used for Succubus: The Reborn, the first title in the Party Poker RPG line of games which is playable by 8-90 players (with one deck needed for each ten players). One player serves as the Dealer, who oversees gameplay and leads others in what to do; everyone else is divided as evenly as possible into four teams, the teams being vampires who are members of four great Lineages represented by the four card suits:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Diamonds &ndash; The Marquisi (The Elite Ones) blend in among mortals that they might trade in money, power, and control, all while clinging to an old world sense of protocol and social decorum.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hearts &ndash; The Copeadora (The Beautiful Ones) are universally insane, but also very beautiful &ndash; a benefit which they utilize in order to slake their unholy thirsts at the necks of beautiful socialites and wealthy benefactors.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Clubs &ndash; The Bas-Bazouk (The Outlaws) are the enforcers, criminals, anarchists, and street-toughs of the Vampire world, plying their wits and their supernatural strength to devastating effect in combat.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Spades &ndash; Unlike other Vampires, the Profugos (The Forlorn) do not possess a soul; they are therefore cursed with deep, soulless, black eyes, and are prone to acts of immorality and depravity.&#10;&#10;&#10;Succubus: The Reborn is played over three acts, and in each act, players try to improve their hand of cards to create the best poker hand. In the first round players can trade however they wish amongst each other as long as each player always has five cards; if a player manages to trade away a joker, that player takes a card at random from the other person's hand instead of any card agreed upon. When the Dealer calls time, the player on each team with the highest card in that team's suit is the Captain, and all the Captains then compete in a single poker hand with the cards they hold, trying to win chips in the process.&#10;&#10;From the second act on, players can trade cards with the Dealer for the cost of one chip, taking a random card from what remains in the deck. To trade cards in the second act, you trade in the same manner as the first act or you challenge another player, paying them a chip to do. In a challenge, each player chooses and reveals a card from his hand, with scissors beating bomb, which beats rock, and so on. The winner of the challenge decides whether or not to trade. For the third act, you can trade only with your teammates. After the second and third acts, each team Captain again competes in a poker hand, with the winner of the third such hand winning the entire game and bringing glory to his team.&#10;&#10;Succubus: The Reborn includes a number of advanced rules that add quests, shadow symbols that allow for better trades with the dealer, character sheets that add special powers to the game, and more.&#10;&#10;"
