With their simple rules and the excitement of rivalry, memory games appeal to both children and adults, and older players do not necessarily have an advantage over younger ones. Ever since they first appeared in the 1950s, games that involve looking for pairs of identical objects have enjoyed unflagging popularity and thousands of versions have been produced. While ZnajZnak &ndash; Pami&#196;&#153;&#196;&#135; continues this long tradition, it also introduces a certain element of novelty, because players acquire knowledge automatically while playing.&#10;The game is composed of 48 cards. There are 16 pairs of the symbols of recent Polish history and also 16 cards with the names. Among the cards players have to find a pair of the same symbols and then point one of the 16 cards with the names of symbols. &#10;A historical commentary on each symbol is provided in the enclosed brochure.&#10;&#10;"

The sixty-card deck consists of the standard 52-card deck, plus four Magicians and four Witches, two good and two bad, with Witches ranking between Jacks and Tens.&#10;&#10;As in Hearts, HeartSwitch is a trick-taking game with fairly standard rules. The lead player plays a single card, then each other player must follow suit, if possible &ndash; except that a player can always choose to play a Magician. A Magician is a null card that can never win a trick (unless a trick consists only of Magicians). Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led collects the cards, then leads to the next trick.&#10;&#10;After everyone's hand is empty, players score points for the cards they've collected. As in Hearts, each heart collected is one point, while the Queen of Spades is 13 points. What's new in &quot;HeartSwitch&quot; is that the Witch of Spades is worth 5 points, while the Witch of Clubs cancels points earned for either of the Spades cards. The Witch of Hearts doubles points earned from hearts up to a maximum of 15 points, while the Witch of Diamonds knocks up to 5 points off your score. If a player &quot;shoots the moon&quot; by collecting all the hearts and either the Witch or Queen of Spades (or both), that player scores no points while everyone else scores 20, 25 or 30 points.&#10;&#10;Players continue playing rounds until one player reaches 70 points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins. Alternatively, players can agree to play a set number of rounds, with the lowest-scoring player winning the game.&#10;&#10;"

Two-to-four players are pitted against one another as one of the four main powers on the Western Front.  You will command both common and specialist troops from the armies of Britain and France or Germany and Austro-Hungary, including soldiers distinctly unique to each.&#10;&#10;Every play-through will be different.  Hazards are deployed before the start of each match, including barbed wire and craters.  The mechanics for every weapon is distinctly different.  The Maxim and Vickers guns will chew an arc across the board.  Snipers will pick off single targets daring or foolish enough to step up to the edge of their trench.  Riflemen will make their slow, bolt-action attacks or grapple in melee combat with bayonets and hand-to-hand weapons until one comes out the survivor.&#10;&#10;Combat outcomes, be they melee or ranged, will be decided with alterable randomness.  The default chances to hit are decided between the unit&rsquo;s skill and cards drawn from the deck.  Each player is dealt a new hand of cards at the start of each of the eight turns.  First the attacker has the opportunity to influence an event where the random card drawn is not in their favor.  The player can choose the card best suited from their hand to turn it in their favor.  In return, the defender can then counter, if they so choose, with a better suited card they choose from their own hand.  This influencing with cards can go back and forth until one player runs out of cards or decides they have expended enough.  It will be a bloody day along the trench.  Will it be that of your soldiers or the enemy&rsquo;s?&#10;&#10;Adding to the replay potential are the missions that players will be issued to complete.  Players could be tasked to capture and hold locations in the dangerous No Man&rsquo;s Land, to make hazardous excursions to retrieve pilots and the film from downed biplanes, or even going Over the Top to seize the enemy&rsquo;s trench.  Each of these missions, and others, change the nature of the experience.  The tactics to cover a sortie to a biplane won&rsquo;t work to invade the enemy&rsquo;s trench.  How to place machine guns for maximum effect, when and where to bombard the enemy with poison gas, and where to drive a charge of riflemen towards are all in the player&rsquo;s power.  Wise tactics will mean the difference between success and yet another bloodbath.  It will take more than firepower to live through the day.  Each commander will need cunning, thoughtfulness, and a patience to time their attacks and defenses to best effect.&#10;&#10;"

Bananagrams Against Humanity according to the dirtier playtesters, even though it's not as inevitably dirty as Cards Against Humanity) is a word game and party game, which uses anagrams to create humor. Players race to form responses to prompts from jumbles of letter tiles, and then try to explain what on earth their responses mean, for points. It's hard to say exactly what you want to say, and hard to avoid being funny.&#10;&#10;"

Through skillful planning, careful preparations, commitment and a little luck, one player will emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;Gener&aacute;lov&eacute; (Commanders) differs from other wargames by simultaneous order planing and resolution, by the austere elegance of Chess, and by the incredible variety of combat situations on mere nine battlefield spaces. Infantry, cavalry and artillery clash in a series of fights in which the victorious player usually is the one who positioned his troops more skilfuly and better used unit abilities in a combat. Even a slight twist in another section of the battlefield can influence the outcome. Situation is constantly changing and it is usually not until the last moment one can be sure of victory.&#10;&#10;Rules offer a range of optional mechanics and is suitable both for beginners and for seasoned wargamers.&#10;&#10;"

Players must not violate her strange rules or those of her crazed consort, BullyQ, while attempting to rise further in her favor, or possibly even overthrow her rule.&#10;&#10;Mad QUAO is a lightweight hierarchy card game with a few twists. Players take turns playing cards on a central pile and drawing new cards, seeking to empty their hands as soon as the draw deck runs out. The order that players go out determines the hierarchy for the next round.&#10;&#10;But at the beginning of each round, the QUAO adds a new bizarre QUAO Rule Card to the game. If a player breaks a QUAO Rule, they must draw a card &ndash; and so must all of the lower-ranked players. (Of course, the player who caught them gets immunity!) Over the course of the game, other special cards may come up. Bully Rules are similar to QUAO Rules, but affect only one player. In addition, the lower-ranked players have access to a few special Wild Cards in the deck, but they require players to perform stunts.&#10;&#10;The end result is a card game in which you can rise from the ranks of the chicken proletariat to ruler of The Farm through good play and a lot of luck, but you might also have to win a fashion runway walk-off, talk only through a sock puppet, and never say the word &quot;turn&quot;.&#10;&#10;Good luck, QUAOmrade!&#10;&#10;"
