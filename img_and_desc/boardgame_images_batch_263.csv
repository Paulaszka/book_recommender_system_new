Players have five card slots in front of them, from which they play cards into the center of the table onto piles which comprise dragons made up of first a tail, then the numbers 1-10, and then a head.  When players have played a card from one of their slots, they then quickly replace it with one from their deck.  Players may play on any dragon stack in the center, which leads to a great deal of frenzy as players try to monitor their own play stacks, keep an eye on the multiple dragon piles that are constantly growing, and try to avoid allowing other players to gain an advantage in building.&#10;&#10;Optional rules introduce complexity in scoring, the color sequencing of dragons, battles between players for simultaneous card play, and two-headed or two-tailed dragons.  A notable feature of the game is its giant fold-out play mat which includes markings for card play and card slots.&#10;&#10;"

Torpedo attack relies upon two &quot;D&quot; sized batteries to power the naval warfare game board.  Two opponents maneuver their battleships across the ocean while the opposing player attempts to find and torpedo them.  A red light comes on when a hit is successful and a small magnet is placed upon the &quot;damaged&quot; ship.  An interesting game that appears to have been produced in the early to mid 1960s.&#10;&#10;

Finally, a card may allow the player to take a replacement card from any of the cities, not just the one where the player has added a tower piece.  All cards played are kept by the player.

Final Argument bears a strong resemblance to the latter but was designed to tune to the warfare of the middle part of the 18th century.  These rules are appropriate for games set from the time of the War of the Polish Succession (1734) to the beginning of the Wars of the French Revolution (1789.)  It is scaled to be appropriate for battle on the European continent.  For 15mm figures, one inch on the table represents 45-50 yards.&#10;&#10;Horse and foot units are each four stands and represent infantry battalions and cavalry regiments.  Artillery batteries are single stands as are army, wing, and brigade commanders.  The number of figures per unit is variable with each figure representing 40 soldiers or one section of artillery.  Stand size is variable with the number of figures so that units with more men cover a wider frontage.  (The game would be playable with other basing systems, but the game's basing has a number of subtleties that transmit the tactical feel of the time.  For example, units are longer in march column than they are wide in line as, indeed, they should be.)&#10;&#10;Turns follow a set sequence with simultaneous movement and fire of various types.  Each turn represents 20 minutes of time.  Players mark orders for units that are hidden from the opposing player.  Command is an important element but does not dominate the game or become obtrusive.  There is also provision for grand tactical movement so that maneuver and closing to battle may happen quickly without taking too much time nor sacrificing tactical detail.  Combat tends to be bloody with stands taking figure losses as a result.  Morale of units is a key game concept.  Units have a basic morale point that is altered by loss of strength and the local situation faced by the units.  Battlefield events trigger morale checks.  There are no saving roles.&#10;&#10;"

The basic game provides a good blend of strategy and luck, while advanced rules allow for either pure skill games, or ones where luck is more of a factor. Suitable for solitaire, one to five individual players, and several combinations of teams.&#10;&#10;The game of Tesserae pits players against one another, meshing colored tiles into the ever-evolving play field, each trying to exhaust their supply of tiles while preventing their opponents from doing the same. Skillful strategy can pay off, but be careful -- things can change on the luck of a draw! This is a game that will stretch your brain.&#10;&#10;"
