Since the Japanese had decisively beat the Russians in the 1902 - 1905 war, they thought it would be easy once again.

Laconic fascination of traditional Japanese architecture, ancient European card-building passion and a native Russian talent of constructing magnificent edifices without any nail are united in this game.&#10;&#10;The game concept is familiar to everyone who has built a card castle at least once: vertical piers are leaned together and horizontal cards are placed at their top becoming a base for the new floor, and it continues till there are no cards left or one clumsy movement ruins all the construction. Moreover standard cards called heki which are used only for walls there are some other building elements: gamen screens (twice bigger than heki) and yanegae overlaps with the special fixed stops for heki. Vertical cards stay at their places because of it so castle levels can be built as a tower one right above another, not only like a pyramid. Yanegae cards are of two sizes &ndash; small ones with the space for one leaned pair of heki (this construction is called karigoya) and big for two pairs which can be placed transversely to each other as well as parallel. The last variety of big yanegae with two perpendicular pairs is called antei and works as the basic unit for the most of constructions.&#10;&#10;Rules offer many varieties of the game: for one player or for the company of 2-4 builders. There can be up to 8 players if two game kits are used. Solo gameplay is simple &ndash; you need to build a castle as high as possible. There are no strict rules &ndash; you can use any element conditionally to your imagination. Competing versions usually offer to build a tower of exact height in a pelter or make the most solid building &ndash; in this case players jolt the table trying to ruin opponent&rsquo;s castle and not to damage own. Especially amusing version tenders to take your castle and move it to another table keeping it all-of-a-piece, of cause. There is also some kind of gameplay resembling Jenga &ndash; players put some cards into a heap, place a few karigoya at the top and try to pull the cards out of the heap without busting the buildings.&#10;&#10;Building castles with special elements is easier than with common cards but still the same interesting. Japanese castle can be even built by a child nevertheless nobody suggests to play it in the after-party morning. &#10;The game differs favorably from the common cards by design &ndash; building elements show off the authentical Japanese pictures and interiors from the rich collection of the &ldquo;Yugen&rdquo; antiques gallery. Japanese castle will give you hours of creativity and excitement and maybe can become a first step to a high-altitude card building champion title for someone. Theoretically 5 Japanese castle game sets will be enough to build an eight-meter tower &ndash; the last registered record doesn&rsquo;t haul a bit to this point.&#10;&#10;"

Futbolmate is an innovative option in which the player develops his own winning plays, so the amusement is not lost in any play.&#10;&#10;The soccer strategy game Futbolmate has a rectangular board in 108 green and yellow blocks; on these blocks are placed 18 round pieces in two colors to represent the two teams. The two goalkeepers move similar to the Queen in Chess &ndash; that is, as many spaces as desired in any straight direction. The other pieces can move only one diagonal space each turn. Another smaller round piece represents the ball. The objective of the game is to move all the pieces over the rectangular board to score the most goals in an established time. The game ends with a winner or a tie, similar to professional soccer.&#10;&#10;The movement of the ball makes the difference. It does not follow a predetermined path, as its movement responds to the logic mazes of S&aacute;gaze, rules that allow the ball to rebound on the pieces and edges board, with players always trying to recover the ball or score a goal. Futbolmate uses no dice, no cards, and no other random elements &ndash; only the skill of the two players.&#10;&#10;"
