By unlocking ancient Indian stories and unleashing the warriors of yore, Leprechaun Games has created a strategic card game with an unique theme that is both brand new and several millennia old.&#10;&#10;Maha Yodha consists of two decks, each of which represents a faction; each faction consists of a unique army of warriors, weapons and scrolls. You will go head-to-head with your opponent, spending valor to dispatch warriors to the front-line to not only deal damage but also defend your life. As in the ancient myths, each warrior has a chosen weapon, which when paired together award bonus powers. Divine scrolls, inspired by interesting characters and stories from the Hindu myths, award you with powerful bonus skills, extra valor, and deadly force to help you take down your opponent.&#10;&#10;Maha Yodha features exquisite traditional Indian artwork, or Pattachitra, as well as specially commissioned illustrations of celebrated warriors and weapons in a visceral modern style.&#10;&#10;"

Unfortunately, the lighthouse company is understaffed, with only three workers to man the six lighthouses. To make matters worse, a storm is coming up the coast. You have to manage which three lighthouse will be turned on at any one time to move your sailboats. Some moves will help all players, while others will help only you. How far will you manage to get you sailboats before the storm catches you?&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player has an identical deck of fourteen cards. The game is played over twelve rounds, and each round a player has a hand of three cards. Each turn, the player plays a card to move a number of boats, some their own and some belonging to other players. The cards also adjust which lighthouses are lit, and the boats may move only if the lighthouse they are approaching is lit. At the end of each round, the storm move closer to the boats on the board. Any boats caught by the storm are out of the game and will score points for the last lighthouse that was passed. The game ends when the storm reaches the harbor at the end of the twelfth round. Player add the points earned for each of their boats and the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;"

Many of the Creatures in this half of the deck get killer bonuses for replacing Creatures that were already in play. It complements the Useless Swamp desire for a large discard pile as well.

Each player chooses a faction with unique dice which include modified numbers and a special ability symbol, and uses this to capture objective cards. The factions in the base game include wizards, aliens, giant robots, superheroes and fairies.&#10;&#10;On your turn you choose and roll one of your dice, plus every horde die that has previously failed to capture an objective. Objectives either have one or more dice that must be matched, or a goal like 'a 3 die straight' or '3 dice with a sum greater than 15'. Dice that are used to capture return to their owner, other dice stay in the horde and continue to be used by other players to try and capture dice. The first player to capture 10 points worth of dice wins.&#10;&#10;"

Game play is centered around building an economic engine, and uses a bidding mechanic where players must balance bids to get the good stuff and to avoid the bad against the actions needed to build their empire, while saving high bids as much as possible to convert to cash at the end of each season.&#10;&#10;The game has a fixed number of turns - six seasons of five rounds each - and total play time tends to be about 2-2.5 hours for 4 people (the game is designed for 3-5, with a solid 2-player variant), on par with a feature movie. In every round there is one card per player up for grabs - every player gets a card every round. The cards on which players bid are businesses that are used to build up your economic engine, extra actions to be saved until needed most (and they let a player do some things outside the normal rules of play), special agenda cards that give score a bonus at the end of the game (how much depends on how well the conditions for the given card are fulfilled), and bad events (which are to be avoided if possible).&#10;&#10;Players are bidding pick order rather than on a particular item. Each players uses a set nine of bidding cards (getting them all back at the start of each season), which represent how the player is dividing their attention that round between trying to get the best of the available items and getting other stuff done. Each bid has a specific action that it allows (lower bids have more powerful actions), and bids saved for the end of the season are worth extra money - the higher the bid the more it&rsquo;s worth. These additional aspects associated with each bid, the action and the end-of-season cash value, make for exciting, meaningful choices every round.&#10;&#10;Business Mogul supports multiple valid strategies, though the highest final score usually goes to the player that dabbles in additional strategies beyond their primary one. The key to winning is being tactically smart about balancing pick order vs action vs end-of-season-payout, paying attention to the state of other player&rsquo;s empires and the bids they've already used in the current season, and executing a strategy that adapts to the flow of items up for bid.&#10;&#10;There are some fairly common game mechanics/attributes that Mogul specifically does not have:&#10;&#10;- It has no player-to-player aggression - the bidding each round is the only point of direct competition. &#10;- It does not have random action outcomes (that is whether or not a given action succeeds is not determined by dice, card draw, or anything like that). &#10;- It does not have any kind of territory control. &#10;- It has no resources / production beyond money and end-game score.&#10;- It does not require memorization of what&rsquo;s been played; aside from a single hidden card each player gets at the start and the particular bid a player is making in a given round, the state of the game is fully revealed.&#10;&#10;"
