A simplified version was  commercially marketed as Aggravation, with rules similar to Pachisi.   A similar version, finally under the Wahoo name, was copyrighted in the 1990's by Traditional Game & Toy Company.  However, there are as many variant rule sets and board configurations of Wahoo as there are families playing, many of the variants involving partnerships and deeper strategy.&#10;&#10;"

You can use a combination of propellers to allow the boat to spin and change direction.&#10;&#10;The soldiers on each battle boat may shoot their gun straight ahead.  Each gun has a shield protecting the soldier and the boat from being shot.

The video was produced by Ed. Arcade Movie Company in 1998.&#10;&#10;Are you curious about how gnomes live? Do you wanna know what kinds there are, and how they live? Find out with this game.&#10;&#10;This is based on the traditional &quot;Game of Goose&quot; board game. The game board consists of a spiral track with consecutively numbered spaces up to the number 63 with the starting point on the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to the roll of a die. The spaces are numbered and filled with objects that are specific to the lore of gnomes that you will learn about when you land on them. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a gnome is depicted. Landing on a gnome allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards, lose one or more turns, or be sent back to start.&#10;&#10;Ages 4-400. Includes VHS video, gnome board game, 6-piece puzzle board, 4 gnome hat pawns, and a white die.&#10;&#10;"

33714,,"The object of the game is to collect as much money, love, and possessions as possible before you lose it all. The game can be played with 2-8 players.&#10;&#10;How to Start:&#10;Players choose their pieces.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with $1500 (however the money can summed up to equal $1500 is fine. Ex. Two $500 bills and five $100 bills or three $500 Bills)&#10;&#10;All players start on the START space.&#10;&#10;Place all of the &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve Found True Love&rsquo; cards (8 total) on the &lsquo;Found True Love&rsquo; Space. Do the same for the &lsquo;Makin&rsquo; Money&rsquo; cards on the &lsquo;Makin Money&rsquo; Space&#10;&#10;Roll Dice to determine who goes first.&#10;&#10;After the first person is determined to start the game all players&rsquo; turns are random. After each play you must spin the bottle. When the bottle stops turning and the head of the bottle is facing someone that person goes. You cannot go twice in a row it must land on someone other than yourself. In the case of two players just go back and forth, no need to spin the bottle.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;Once it is your turn, roll the dice.&#10;&#10;Move the amount of spaces as dictated by the dice.&#10;&#10;After you have moved to that space pick a card from the draw pile (the draw pile should consist of all cards that are not money, making money, or found true love cards). If you land on a space that says &lsquo;Lose it all&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get scammed&rsquo;, you move to the large corner space with those titles on the board and DO NOT move off of it until you roll a &ldquo;6&rdquo; or higher by adding together both dice. Then you move only ONE space off of &lsquo;Lose it all&rsquo; or &lsquo;Get Scammed&rsquo;. You can be sent to these spaces by either landing on them or drawing a card that sends you there, either way the rules apply.&#10;&#10;Follow what the cards tell you to do from there on out.&#10;a.    Put cards next to the draw deck that you cannot keep.&#10;&#10;b.    If you get a keepable card (ex. A house or car) and you already have it nothing happens just put it in the discard pile.&#10;c.    Re-shuffle the cards once there are no more left in the draw pile.&#10;&#10;d.    If you land on a corner space your turn ends there regardless of how many spaces you rolled.&#10;&#10;How to end the game:&#10;     Someone has found a true love card on the &ldquo;Find true love&rsquo; space&rsquo;, they have a job card, a house card, and a car card, land on the &lsquo;Makin Money&rsquo; Space to get a &ldquo;Makin Money&rsquo; card, and make their way back to the Start space. When they have done all this they have won the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

When a virus attacks a tulip, the resulting colour patterns can be stunning, but the same virus weakens the tulip and makes reproduction a challenge. These rare tulips have always been quite expensive, even to this day. Many associate Tulipmania with these rare, high-priced tulips, but scholars report that this first bubble market, where buyers pay far more than something is physically worth because of the resale value, actually stemmed from the common tulip market over December 1636 and January 1637.&#10;&#10;The Dutch, well-known for their trading prowess, were the centre of the tulip trade. During this time, the bubonic plague was killing off 1 out of every 7 people per year, so the common man saw little reason not to invest foolishly with a chance of making a substantial profit. These conditions created a situation where the prices of tulips skyrocketed by the day, until the prices hit a point that could not be sustained. The wily investors knew when to sell off, so those who profited most are those who sold just as the market started to turn sour.&#10;&#10;You are playing one of those wily investors.

From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?&#10;&#10;Omega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)&#10;     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)&#10;     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)&#10;     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)&#10;     Research (select an available technology)&#10;&#10;&#10;In the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.&#10;&#10;The advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way? The winner of the game will be the player who has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the final round of play. Omega Centauri offers players many routes to victory, and you can accumulate victory points (VPs) by wresting control of sectors of space from the Empire (or from other players), by improving your infrastructure and planetary defenses, or by expanding your cultural influence. The player with the most VPs at the end of the final round is deemed to have ascended and established the new dominant Empire in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;"

Designer Peter Ramos began working on this game a year after beginning the NetEpic project.&#10;&#10;Heresy is built to reflect more &ldquo;gritty&rdquo; game mechanics that usually get left out in most game systems like morale, true command and control and combined arms tactics. It is designed for a minimum 6 by 4 feet playing surface and uses ten-sided dice to resolve most of combat. Although Heresy is based in the Warhammer 40,000 universe using Epic scale miniatures, it is not authorized by Games Workshop, and any 6mm model range can serves as proxies.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are not based on any previous version of Epic. Counters, templates, and tables are downloadable. The game is meant to be as self-contained as possible.&#10;&#10;Heresy is available from http://www.netepic.org/EPICentre/Downloads/&#10;&#10;(Note: This link is dead)&#10;&#10;Heresy is now at this link: http://www.netepic.org/&#10;&#10;"

Each hole may contain some of the various golf hazards: bunkers, water, rough, trees etc. Three different games are described in the rules: novice, standard and handicap. For each golf hole, players select from several possible routes marked on the boards, study a club/distance chart to determine which club best suits the chosen route then roll a 14 sided dice to determine the accuracy of the shot (accurate, good, poor, hook/slice, fault). This repeats until the green is reached. Once on the green, separate charts manage the process of putting.&#10;&#10;The handicap version of the game allows chips to be won for good shots which can be played at various times during the hole eg to avoid bad rolls, negotiate hazards or make small advancements.&#10;&#10;Not so much an edit as an addition to the information. The designer and artist of this game was Eddie Solomons,not Eric as stated. He was assisted by his family who have happy memories of researching and dry running the game. One daughter, who was just 18 at the time was sent off to the patents office in London, England, to research the design of the then innovotive multisided dice based on a golf ball.How do I know all this? I am that daughter! Sadly, Eddie passed away on the 9th September 2011 aged 86. It was kinda nice to see his game remebered on the internet. Unfortunately, when his grandson arrived at his hospital bed to show him, he was already starting to slip away. Thank you,all the BoardGameGeeks, for immortalising part of the eccentric late Eddie Solomons.&#10;&#10;"
