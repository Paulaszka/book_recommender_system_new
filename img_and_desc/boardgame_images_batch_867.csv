The game takes place in Japan during the Meiji Era (1867-1912). Maiko are trainees whose goal is to excel in the exquisite arts : dance, music and kimono wearing, in order to become an exceptional woman, a geisha.&#10;To attain this honor, maikos dwell in an okiya, a geisha house where they receive their training.&#10;&#10;In Maiko you play as a young maiko training her memory by searching for items throughout the okiya. These items represent the ancestral geisha arts: find similar tiles to discover their secrets!When you reveal a pair of tiles with the same items, it means that you learned one of the nine arts of the geishas! Possessing tiles of your maiko&rsquo;s color increases  your points. Conversely, possessing tiles of other colors decreases your points. Indeed Maiko is a game of memory but also elegance!During your training, you can also get kamon tokens, marks of prestige, that let you call upon four tutors  to  help  you  on  your  quest.  Each  tutor  possesses  a  unique  talent  that  will  lead  the  brightest  maiko to the victory. The maiko with the most points wins and begins her geisha career.&#10;&#10;"

This is a tradition that dates back to medieval times and is still alive in German-speaking countries. A craftsman has to be &quot;Auf der Walz&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;on the road&quot;) for three years and one day without ever getting closer than fifty kilometers to home. The young journeyman wears a traditional dress: flared pants, waistcoat, jacket, black hat (as a symbol for freedom), the &quot;Stenz&quot; (traditional curled hiking pole), and the &quot;Charlottenburger&quot; (coarse cloth to wrap up the belongings). They work (for a little bit of money but also for board and lodge) for people on their journey.&#10;&#10;Auf der Walz is a &quot;travel game&quot; with resource management that takes place in the second half of the 19th century. Like life on the Walz, it includes uncertainty and random elements. Each player earns points at the end of each year on the journey and in an end-scoring after that additional one day.&#10;&#10;The engine of the game is a deck of cards. Each player has six cards per year (and an additional card for the last day) and conducts actions with them: traveling, working, finding travel mates, etc. as well as leisure activities: music, writing, painting.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

True, there are no snakes anywhere on the island- but there have been none since before the last Ice Age! The legend is actually an allegory about his successes in converting Ireland to Christianity.&#10;&#10;Banish the Snakes is a cooperative game that simulates Ireland in the 5th century, while the Roman Empire was collapsing in the west and Ireland was turning to the Christian religion. Players represent Saints- Patrick and others (up to six of you) who set out to convert the pagans on the island. You must work as a team to convert the people of Ireland before the barbarians completely overwhelm Britain- if you fail, the Irish will not be able to save Civilization in the following centuries!&#10;&#10;The game board shows a map of Ireland in the 5th century, with four Provinces-the same as today- but no counties yet. Wooden tiles represent the People, Druids, Chiefs, and Kings, and of course the High King at Tara. It is your job to break into the interrelated influences between these groups of people and get your new ideas accepted.&#10;&#10;Each turn a card is drawn, throwing new challenges at your team. The severity of the event is determined by the previous card, and so no two games can ever play the same. The cards introduce events and ideas of the time, new saints, and historic figures- like Neil of the Nine Hostages.&#10;&#10;There is a diagram of Great Britain to keep track of the steady decline of Roman civilization in Great Britain. As different parts of Britain succumb to the barbarians, more and more difficult challenges are added to the deck, until finally Britain is completely overwhelmed, cutting off Ireland from the continent and ending the game.&#10;&#10;If you succeed in your endeavor, Christianity will thrive in Ireland, while paganism overruns Western Europe. The arts, writing, literature and history will flourish on the Emerald Isle! Soon, Irish missionaries will bring these civilizing attributes back to Great Britain and mainland Europe- as Thomas Cahill says in his book, the Irish will save Civilization.&#10;&#10;But if you fail&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

275595,,"Paradise Revolution is a four player strategy tabletop game inspired by the classic strategy games of the past like Risk, Axis and Allies, and Diplomacy featuring a Cold War theme and Latin American aesthetic this game aims to create a fun, intense, and thrilling experience for all players. This game can last for one to five hours, and is build to be easy-to-learn and hard to master, i.e. deep enough gameplay to entertain tabletop strategy veterans while being easy to pick up for new players.&#10;&#10;The setting of the game is Santa Maria, a fictional Caribbean island that is at the center of a proxy conflict between the great powers. Play as one of four factions, the Communists, Fascists, Liberals, or Socialists, and take over the island to form it in your desired image.&#10;&#10;This game was created out of passion and love for classic strategy board games, as well as the creators' keen interest in Cold War history and the history and culture of Latin America. Backing is needed to pay for manufacturing and distribution of the game.&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;Leader Cards&#10;&#10;Each faction controls a portion of the island at the start of the game. Each player picks a leader from their faction, which grants a special ability that can shape a player's strategy. This can range from directly stealing your opponent's resources, sabotaging your opponent's plans through espionage, aggressively pushing into enemy territory, out-producing your opponent, and more.&#10;&#10;Every leader offers a completely unique strategy. In general, fascist leaders focus on building and keeping early momentum, socialist leaders seek to outlast their opponents, communist leaders focus on espionage and sabotage, and liberal leaders focus on resource production and management.&#10;&#10;The Map&#10;&#10;Every state on the board has two resource values: Capital and Manpower. Each turn you can choose to either add your states' resources to your resource pool, or use your current resource pool to build partisans, the game's combat unit. States with a combined resource value of five of more (3/2, for example), are considered &quot;urban&quot; while the rest are considered &quot;non-urban.&quot; Controlling all urban states or controlling four urban states while having five action cards in your hand will win you the game.&#10;&#10;Action Cards&#10;&#10;These cards grant you bonuses or can be used to weaken your foes. They can take many forms, such as passive bonuses, combat buffs, free resources, and more. Action cards can be acquired in two ways. You can draw action cards once per turn, or you can pay 15 capital to spy on an opponent, meaning they must show you their hand, then choose an action card and give it to you. This is a very powerful ability, because not only does it give you a potentially game-changing boost, it can take one away from your opponents as well.&#10;&#10;Action cards, with a few exceptions, can be played at any time, including during an opponent's turn. That opponent who just attacked you with 4 partisans? You can target him with an action card and destroy three of them. Make sure not to spend all your capital on spying, because certain extra-powerful action cards require you to pay capital in order to play them.&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;&#10;The combat in this game is similar to that in Risk and other classic war-games. The attacker rolls up to three dice for each attacking unit, while the defender rolls up to two and has an advantage on ties. If combat is going unexpectedly poorly due to a surprise action card or a streak of unending poor rolls, you can choose to retreat, roll a die, and escape safely if you roll a three or higher. If you roll lower, one of your partisans is destroyed.&#10;&#10;Actions&#10;&#10;Players receive three actions per turn. These include things like invading enemy states, making truces, drawing cards, and spying. Actions are important because they add a new layer of strategy to the game, making it easier to punish an opponent's strategic error, adding new depth to plan around, and more.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Lovecraft where two players fight each other casting spells, summoning Mythos creatures and using firearms. The knowledge about the mythos can be learnt reading rare arcane books and the magical power can be increased to cast more powerful spells, but also the sanity of the character played will lose sanity progressively, leading to schizofrenia, agorafobia and other terrible effects.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to make the life points of the opponent reach zero. From the deck, 5 cards are dealt to each of the players and one card from the hand can be played each round.&#10;&#10;There are three ways damage can be inflicted, by using conventional fire arms, casting spells and summoning Mythos creatures. Creatures do not block direct attacks from the cards and they don&rsquo;t attack directly, instead they counterattack after your opponent has damaged you.&#10;&#10;Cards involving the Chtuhu Mythos (spells and creatures) have a sanity cost which is listed as a number in the card.&#10;&#10;Apart from the life points, there are four other parameters with a value that will change along the game: i) Elder sign, ii) Arcane power, iii) Taint of the yellow sign, and iv) Sanity.&#10;&#10;i) Elder Sign is one defense against the Mythos effects. It can be increased through the use of certain cards. For each point you have, you will take 1 less damage from spell cards and monsters.&#10;&#10;ii) Arcane Power represents the magical power gained by the knowledge of the Mythos. Arcane Power can be increased through the use of certain cards such as reading Arcane books. For every point you have, you will deal one extra damage for all cards that show the symbol next to the damage number.&#10;&#10;iii) Taint of the yellow sign is a magical curse that can be inflicted using certain cards. Its effect is that for every tainted point you have, you will take one damage at the end of your turn. The only way to purge yourself of the taint is to use certain cards.&#10;&#10;iv) Sanity: cards related to the Mythos cost sanity points to use. Sanity is the cost for delving into de Mythos and some cards cost zero due them not being of an occult nature. If your sanity reaches zero you will be insane. There are various types of insanity effects, and one of them will be applied randomly:&#10;&#10;     Schizophrenia: At the end of each turn, Elder Sign and Arcane Power go to zero.&#10;     Megalomania: At the end of each turn, add +2 Arcane and + 4 Taint.&#10;     Xenophobia: your summon cards have no effect.&#10;     Agoraphobia: you can only have 2 cards in your hand.
