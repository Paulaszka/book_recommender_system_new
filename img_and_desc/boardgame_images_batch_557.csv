It is a game of pure luck, with three dice for two or more players.&#10;Each player receives a decided number of chips (e.g. twelve) and puts half of them in the center of the board. The first player then throws the dice. The combination of the three values of the dice can be found on the board and the instructions written underneath each combination must be followed. If, for example, the field says &quot;bezahlt&quot; (or, in the mediaevel version, &quot;bezalt&quot;, meaning: paid), the player has to pay the specified number of chips into the center of the board. But, if it says &quot;nimmt&quot; (or, in the mediaevel version, &quot;nimbt&quot; meaning: take), the player takes the specified number of chips fromt he center of the board. If a player cannot pay sufficient quantities of chips, he places the remaining chips from his/her stash into the center and drops out of this round of the game.&#10;&#10;The game lasts until only one player is left with chips, or until any one player has thrown three sixes. In this lucky case, she/he gets all the chips fromt he center of the board and is thus the big winner of the round. Then, a new round can be started.&#10;&#10;"

The objective of the game is to trap &amp; drown 3 of your opponent's pieces (soldiers).&#10;&#10;The pieces (which we call 'soldiers') consist of 12 numbered checkers. Odd numbered pieces are in red and even numbered in blue. The numbers indicate their turn order in placement &amp; movement phase, both of which follows the ascending order of the numbers on the soldiers.&#10;&#10;1st phase: placement&#10;&#10;Soldiers are being placed on the blocks under the said order. With the only restriction that no soldier can be placed adjacent to another one that was already on the board.&#10;&#10;2nd phase: move &amp; drown&#10;&#10;A soldier on turn can either move to an adjacent block, move any empty adjacent block to a different empty tile on the board, or perform a card action.&#10;&#10;There are 3 types of cards in game. Each player has 2 of each type to begin with and can recover a used card upon drowning an opponent soldier. The 3 cards are:&#10;&#10;Bomb card: destroys a block adjacent to the soldier on turn.&#10;Swap card: swaps the soldier on turn with an adjacent friendly soldier.&#10;Barricade card: creates a barricade block on an empty tile of the board adjacent to the soldier on turn. Barricades are neither movable, destroyable, or mountable.&#10;&#10;Drowning: A soldier is drowned when it is his own turn to move but there is no move available other than to use a card. The drowned soldier will then be removed from the board along with the block it is standing on.&#10;&#10;"

Collect sets and the one with the most when all the cards are collected, wins.&#10;Second game: Codebreaker. Problem setter chooses a code, consisting of a regularly recurring pattern of cards; Example: Red, Green, Green, Blue - Red, Green, Green, Blue, and so on. He takes cards that match this pattern and reveals the first card. If no-one guesses the code, he reveals a second one, and so on until someone guesses the code first and wins.&#10;Third game: Pairs.

A frenetic game of matching cards. Three cards are dealt face up and one face down. The 44 other cards are shared ouzt between both players. At the word &quot;Go&quot;, both players start revealing cards with the objective of being able to lay a card on one of the revealed cards. A card that 'goes' must be the same colour or the same letter (A B C or D) or the same geographical name. First to use all their cards on to the three stacks, wins.&#10;Fifth game: Beggar-My-Neighbour. The traditional British game.&#10;Sixth game: Fortune-Telling. A game and not a Tarot-like prediction system. In their turn, a player turns over a card. The cards are ranked from red A to D, green A to D and blue A to D. The player must 'predict' the next card he turns over as being higher or lower ranked than the revealed card. If he is right, he can try again. If he is wrong, his turn ends and the next player tries. If the card revealed is identically ranked, that ends the player's turn but he does not have to miss a turn. First to turn over all his cards, wins.&#10;Seventh game: Tops. This is exactly the same mechanism as traditional Top Trumps.&#10;Eight game: Patience. A solo game. Cards are ranked as in the Fortune-Telling, described above. As in traditional Patience games you win if you can sort the cards in order.&#10;&#10;"

Fortunately for them, children always find unexpected allies and manage to escape her. Will you prove as fortunate?&#10;&#10;In Baba Yaga, you need to escape the claws of the hideous Baba Yaga. To do so, however, you need to collect the ingredients for your three spell cards, and to do that you need to search the forest while Baba Yaga searches for you.&#10;&#10;To set up the game, place nine Baba Yaga tiles in a cross to form a flight path, then place the 16 ingredient tokens face down, with four tokens in each section of the cross. Each player starts the game with three spell cards, which must remain hidden. On a turn, the active player reveals her top spell card, which shows four ingredients, then starts searching for these ingredients in the forest, turning over tiles one by one with a single hand and hiding those she doesn't need. While she does this, the other players take turns moving the Baba Yaga figurine one step at a time along one branch of the flight path, then back. If Baba Yaga completes a circuit before the player finds the ingredients, she must place her spell card on the bottom of her stack; if she finds the ingredients, however, she gets to cast the spell on the card, lengthening or shortening the flight path, swapping the location of ingredients, requiring fewer ingredients next time, forcing an opponent to play in a distorted position, and so on. The first player to complete her three spells wins!&#10;&#10;Baba Yaga includes variants for younger players, more experienced players, and those who want the chicken-legged house to be constantly on the move. In the two-player game, the single opponent does all the moving of Baba Yaga, but must swap hands with each move, keeping the inactive hand on her head.&#10;&#10;"

Some of the terms (blinds/river) have been changed here to more zombie centric ones (appetizers/blood), while others have been kept (flop/turn/showdown) for hopefully obvious reasons. Gameplay is the same as Hold&rsquo;em except the criteria for determining and ranking winning hands has been changed due to the style of cards used in this version of the game.&#10;&#10;To better understand these rankings, it is necessary to explain the makeup of cards in Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand. In stead of the regular playing card deck used for Texas Hold'em, this deck is first made up of four types of zombies: Walkers, Shamblers, Runners, and Infected. There are twelve cards for each type of zombie. These twelve cards for each type are further divided into Red and Green colored text, with six of each zombie type. Each zombie card also has two numbers, a Decomposition number and a Hunger number ranging from one to six. These numbers and colors are arranged in such a way that each zombie has three other zombies (one of each type) that match it in both color and numbers. Thus, with these card differences, the criteria used for hand rankings is changed while keeping the dealing/betting/bluffing aspects of regular Hold'em.&#10;&#10;Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand is played on a single table with 2 to 10 players. The game is also played with an assortment of chips for the betting rounds. Traditional poker chips can be used or you can try our &quot;Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand: Poker Chips of the Living Dead&quot; (available separately) for a set of zombie themed chips.&#10;&#10;The goal is simple: win as many chips as you can, one pot at a time. You win a pot by having the best hand, or by having all other players fold before the showdown. As in Texas Hold'em, a hand of Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand consists of one to four betting rounds. A hand ends when all players but one have folded, or the fourth and final betting round completes with multiple players still in the hand - whichever comes first. At that point, players enter into the showdown, where remaining players discover who has the best hand.&#10;&#10;"

Times have changed greatly since the PRC failed to conquer the island of Taiwan from the nationalists' Republic of China at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the states that were even then separated by politics and economics have grown further apart as both sides now hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their bitter division once and for all.&#10;&#10;Next War: Taiwan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and the follow-on to Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war in and around the island of Taiwan. In this sequel, the communist leadership of the PRC have decided that its time to end its rhetoric and posturing and bring the long-lost democratically governed ROC island into the fold of the Socialist Harmonious Society.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of the &quot;terrain&quot; surrounding Taiwan, the game features an expanded, yet still abstracted and playable, naval system including submarine threats, ASW, mine warfare, and anti-naval strikes. In addition, rules exist for combining Next War: Taiwan with Next War: Korea to simulate an expanded conflict.&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;UnitsGround units in Next War: Taiwan represent primarily brigades, regiments, and battalions of the armies of the PRC and ROC and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side. Changes to the naval system include&#10;&#10;     Naval Display Play Aid to allow for movement, air ranges, etc. in the seas surrounding Taiwan&#10;     a Submarine Threat Level and ASW Level matrix for the PRC and Allies respectively to represent the subsurface conflict&#10;     naval mine warfare allowing either side to attempt to deny usage of Beaches for Amphibious Assaults or Ports and Beachheads for Sea Transport&#10;     anti-Naval Strikes (including Cruise Missiles) allowing each side to force enemy Naval units to withdraw or risk losses&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and TerrainThe game's map presents the island of modern-day Taiwan at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map covers the entire island and includes several holding boxes and tracking displays.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game SystemA game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.&#10;&#10;Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;&#10;Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines.&#10;&#10;Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes.&#10;&#10;One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns&#10;&#10;Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements&#10;Victory Determination&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three are small and cover the first weeks of the war by dividing the island into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults by the PRC to establish beachheads and take Ports and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire Campaign Game which uses the entire map and all of the Standard Game rules. One other scenario is provided which examines a theoretical U.S. Amphibious landing in an attempt to take back the island.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.&#10;&#10;There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan &#226;&#128;&#147; The Fifth Arab-Israeli War to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Chinese players in the region.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a full set of rules covering how to play a combined Next War: Taiwan/Korea game.&#10;&#10;In Next War: Taiwan, the Taiwan Straits are on fire with the Goliath of the PRC arrayed against the David of the ROC. Can you, as the People's Liberation Army/Naval commander, conquer the long separated island in four weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of China's Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will happen in Korea while all this is going on?

Each round a random terrain card is revealed, such as mountains, winding roads, or cobbles.  These cause riders in play to fall behind based on their strength on that terrain, and also enable special cards to be played.  A player's turn each round consists of drawing cards into their hand and then playing cards to deploy riders, make breakaway attempts, attempt to chase down the breakaway, or impose mishaps like flat tires on opponents.  Within the simple and fast playing mechanics, the game enables players to deploy strategies familiar to cycling fans:  Climbers make valiant breakaway attempts in the mountains, sprinters attempt to hold on for the finish line dash, and domestiques attempt to support them both as their director sportifs shepherd the team toward victory.&#10;&#10;The first edition of First to the Line is produced as a full-color deck of standard sized playing cards featuring hand drawn art.

These range from killing the most zombies to throwing the least weapons. Some also change certain game-play elements. Players can win money and have choice of who plays first by excelling within these different events and winning places above the other players.&#10;&#10;Money can be used to buy revealed weapons and items from the shop stock which is restocked from a deck in the centre of the table. Players take turns to buy weapons and items. After everyone has decided to stop buying they move on to equipping items from their inventory (hand). Weapons add power to a contestant but can also be thrown at individual enemies to deal double damage. Players may also flip their chosen contestants into &quot;BOSS mode&quot; once per game and deal double damage with their contestant and all weapons they control. Items tend to be one use effects such as gaining health, destroying another item/weapon or sending attacking zombies towards another player. Any items and weapons equipped during an event are lost at the end of the round, so players must be tactical when deciding which items/weapons they equip during each event.&#10;&#10;Finally, all players are attacked by zombies from the top of a randomised deck which contains normal zombies, effect zombies and boss zombies. On the first event of the game each player is attacked by two zombies. This number is increased by one during each successive event. The game ends when all players but one have been killed.&#10;&#10;These features alongside a deep fictional flavour, a tonne of tongue-in-cheek pop culture references and a sharp, colourful, art style combine to create a unique game experience for players to get their teeth into!&#10;&#10;"
