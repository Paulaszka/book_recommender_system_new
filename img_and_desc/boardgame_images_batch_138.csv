15734,,"The board for this old Parker Brothers game, endorsed by the Automobile Club of America, depicts the Lincoln Highway map routes. Each player receives a Route Ticket showing six cities at five of which each player must stop. On your turn, you roll the dice and advance your token the number indicated. If the sum of the dice will carry you past a city at which you must stop, you can move only the number of spots shown on either one of the dice. The player first reaching the last named city on his or her Tour Ticket is the winner.&#10;&#10;As a bonus, the flip side of the board has a standard checker board, and the game comes with a complete set of checkers: two games-in-one.&#10;&#10;"

Players have escaped the modern-day zombie hoard only to find themselves transported back in time and faced with a whole new set of problems!&#10;&#10;Game play is fairly straightforward.  Players start at the well and their objective is either to kill 25 points worth of skeletons or to collect the Necromicon from the graveyard and return with it to the Altar.  The various skeletons are worth different points, White are worth 1, Red are worth 2, and Blue are worth 3.&#10;&#10;Players start by drawing a tile and placing it on the board anywhere it will fit.  They then place a number of skeletons and villagers as shown on the tile.  They then roll a six-sided die (d6) for movement.  Movement is orthogonal and limited to the tiles currently in play.  If you encounter a villager you can collect it; skeletons you encounter must be overcome.  At the end of your turn you again roll the d6 to move that many skeletons 1 space each.&#10;&#10;Players can collect up to 5 villagers who can be sacrificed if they lose a fight.  Combat is simple - enter a square with a skeleton and on a 4 or better on a d6, you win.  If the roll is less than 4, you can either sacrifice a villager or pay skeletons to reach 4 or better.  There is no change, so if you roll a 3 and only have reds, you now have a 5.&#10;&#10;Some of the cards also require specific colors of skeletons be used in order to power them and many require that you kill skeletons in order to play them.&#10;&#10;Once a player reaches the Graveyard and grabs the Necronomicon, the other players can attack him during their turns to try to steal it away from him.  The game ends when someone takes the Necronomicon to the center tile of the Altar or collects 25 points worth of skeletons.&#10;&#10;This Zombies!!! sized box contains 30 map tiles, 50 event cards,  6 pawns, 50 sculpted life counters (little gray dudes), rules and 100 HEAVILY ARMED AND ANGRY SKELETON WARRIORS!!! The whole game is done with the same realistic but very tongue-in-cheek style you have come to expect from Twilight Creations.&#10;&#10;Part of the MidEvil/Zombies!!! series&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Midevil II: Castle Chaos&#10;    MidEvil III:  Subterranean Homesick Blues!&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Goods shipments, intended for transport along sea routes, are in danger of gathering dust in the warehouses or being lost at sea in a storm. While the players speculate about success and failure, the ultimate fate of the ships will be determined by the dice.&#10;&#10;There are four shipments that need to get to Manila - jade, ginseng, silk and nutmeg. A round begins with an initial auction to become harbour master. If you win, you'll be allowed to buy a share of one of the shipments, choose which three shipments you'd like to take down river and how likely they are to make it to their destination in the harbour. If they make it to Manila, their share price will increase. The aim of the game is to bet on the outcome of these shipments, with dice ultimately determining their fate. How many of the three boats will make it and which ones? Would you like to provide insurance against possible failed ships or perhaps you think pirates will snatch a chance to take control? Manila is a fun family game that takes minutes to learn and brings the river boats of the Philippines to life!&#10;&#10;"

When a player calls &quot;cheat&quot;, the number of cards declared is then revealed. If the cards are all of the value given, the player who called &quot;cheat&quot; must take the whole stack of cards into their hand and the falsely accused cheater may start a new stack.
