The top layer has a race course with hole on each square surrounded by a plastic rim to hold upright the narrow player pawns. The bottom layer is on black card with various holes and sits inside the box. When the upper board is placed on top most squares on the race track have a solid footing for the pawns, but some have holes that allow the pawns to fall through into the box and out of the game. The boards are square so that they can be rotated in relation to each other to provide variable distribution of the holes.&#10;&#10;Each player takes 5 pawns. The winner is the first person to get a pawn to the end of the track. Players roll the dice and move one of their pawns the distance indicated. If they have multiple pawns on the track they can chose which one to move. When a hole is discovered by a player losing their piece to it all players need to remember where it is so that they don't repeat the mistake.&#10;&#10;"

Once the cards have been shuffled, the scorekeeper deals 3 cards face down to each player, along with an equal number of white dice, called a stash. The scorekeeper places the remaining cards face down off to one side of the table to form a deck.&#10;&#10;The scorekeeper begins the game by rolling two dice (1 black &amp; 1 white) in the center of the table. If no one scores, play rotates clockwise to the next player who rolls two dice. Any two die, including the black die can be rolled (see below). Before each roll players examine their cards to see what dice combinations will be needed to match a card in their hand.&#10;&#10;Two white dice from your stash, or. &#10;One die from your stash, and one (previously rolled) die from the table, or&#10;Two (previously rolled) dice from the table.&#10;&#10;Player&rsquo;s take turns rolling until someone shouts STRUT! indicating a player believes they have won the round. A round is won when you match a card in your hand with a dice combination on the table. Let&rsquo;s say you have a 4 of a Kind (card) in your hand. There are 8 dice on the table 1,3,4,6 and four 5&rsquo;s: 5, 5, 5. You quickly shout Strut! believing your dice combination (four 5&rsquo;s) matches the card (4 of a Kind) in your hand, thus winning the round. But have you? You have if one of your 5&rsquo;s is the black die. The black die must always be part of the score.&#10;&#10;Keeping score is very simple. All dice on the table are scored. The black die counts face value [1]=1 point, [2]= 2 points [3]=3 points, etc. White dice count 1 point each. In the example above, you scored a total of 12 points (5 points for the black die and 7 points for the white dice.)&#10;&#10;After each round the winner&rsquo;s points are totaled by the scorekeeper. After the scorekeeper has recorded the points, the winner discards his/her winning card, placing it &ldquo;face up&rdquo; under the deck. If the winner&rsquo;s accumulated score totals less than 30 points then he/she must draw one new card from the deck. If the winner has accumulated 30 or more points, no card is drawn allowing that player to begin ridding his/her hand of cards in an attempt to win the game. (Re-Action cards are an exception to the &ldquo;30 points&rdquo; rule.) All other players keep their cards. Dice on the table are evenly redistributed. Note: As you will see as the game progresses, tactics and strategies become a big part of each round.&#10;&#10;The winner begins the next round by rolling 1 black and 1 white die. Play continues until someone shouts Strut! The first player to accumulate 30 or more points with no cards remaining in their hand wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Black Rooster&#10;&#10;If an opponent throws the Black Rooster card down on your winning card, it spells disaster! You must turn in all the cards in your hand, and draw 3 replacements. Plus, you lose all your accumulated points.&#10;&#10;"

They are further divided into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and difficult.&#10;&#10;Avista Pro is really just the 2nd edition of Avista, rather than a self-standing game; the rules are exactly the same, the number of cards is exactly the same, and the first edition already had three difficulty levels; whether the subject matters are more difficult or not is arguable.&#10;&#10;"

In August, with the aid of England and Esthonia, the Russian &ldquo;Northwestern Government&rdquo; was established. Yudenich&rsquo;s planned Fall offensive was timed to coincide with the pinnacle of the White&rsquo;s success, as Denikin approached Orel and Tula, the munitions-manufacturing center. From there it was only a short distance to Moscow. Heroic Frenzy covers the battle for Petrograd during this time.&#10;&#10;The map scale is about 3-3.5 miles per hex.
