In Crystallized, players will match up colors on the hexagonal cards in their hand with those already played in the play area. Once the color or colors have been matched up, the player will deposit the appropriate number of crystals to the facet board. If a player makes a match with a card that scores more than enough to fill the facet board with that color, they may take the leftover crystals, and dump them on an opponent &ndash; as long as that player has at least one of that color in their collection. They are stuck with those unwanted crystals for the rest of the game.  Don&rsquo;t forget that cards can also be built on top of other cards within the play area, making the game even more complex and challenging. The game is made up of high-quality components that feature a satisfying tactile experience.

Drawing a card can result in a move card or an ability card.&#10;&#10;Cryptodome is a free-for-all game for 2-8 players ages 14 and up that can be played in about an hour.
