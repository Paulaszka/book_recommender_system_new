From landscape to music, history to sport, one should not only have their red-white-red knowledge up to date, but also be ready to shine in their negotiation skills since questions are not only answered, but also bought and exchanged. During the game, players have a number of question cards in their possession and can answer only those about Austria as a whole and those about the region of the country in which their game figure is currently located. Thus, you might want to trade cards with others, offer them cash, move to new locations, or pay to return cards that are too difficult to answer. Too pay too much, though, for in the end the first player to collect a previously agreed upon sum of money wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

For instance, only the Kodiak bear (ursus arctos middendorffi) weighs about 2,000 lbs.

Your team has been charged with confiscating these items and returning them to their proper locations in time, so you now need to infiltrate the mansion and abscond with four items before Prof. Evil can secrete four of them in locations inaccessible to you. Thankfully the old soul is a bit daft and won't evaporate you should he catch you lurking through the mansion, but simply scoot you out the front door where he'll forget about you immediately.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first draw and reveal two cards from your tiny deck, then keep one of the cards based on what you think will help you this turn. You then take three actions, such as open a door in the room you're in, move from a room (or outside) to another room (assuming the door is open), disable a trap, or grab a treasure; using a card isn't an action unless it says otherwise. You can repeat actions as desired or needed, but you can't enter a room with Prof. Evil and you can't exit the house on your own (in order to run across the grounds to another window) once you enter. You're now committed to grabbing those treasures!&#10;&#10;After you finish your turn, Prof. Evil now moves, but again he's not all there, so he doesn't necessarily move in a logical manner. To move him, you roll three dice: One die advances the secondary Prof. Evil figure on the clock on the board either five or ten minutes; the other two determine where Prof. Evil moves and how far. What's more, as he walks through rooms, he closes the doors through which he travels and reactivates any inactive traps he encounters. If you roll a blue and a 1, for example, he moves through the blue doorway into the next adjacent room; a red and a 3 will move him through three rooms, walking through the red doorway each time. A color and a particular signal will teleport him immediately to the treasure bearing the same colored marker.&#10;&#10;Let's look at these treasures in more detail: Each treasure shows a time value and one or more traps on it. Three treasures are placed on the board, then a blue, red and green token are placed on the treasures, with a matching blue, red and green token placed on the game board clock on the time matching what's on the treasure. The Magna Carta might say 45 minutes, for example, and after placing a blue token on the Magna Carta, you place a blue token on the clock 45 minutes away from where the Prof. Evil figure is located. If Prof. Evil moves onto this token on the clock, then that treasure is lost &mdash; and if you lose four treasures, then you've lost the game. Remove it from play and replace it with a new treasure, marking the proper time on the clock.&#10;&#10;Note that you can't just grab a treasure, however. Professor Evil can't be in the same room (of course), but you also must ensure that all the traps shown on the treasure are currently deactivated. The game board starts with eight traps on it &mdash; half active, half not &mdash; and you'll play tug-of-war with Professor Evil over keeping them in this status. Collect a treasure, and a new one will be added to the game board; collect four treasures before Prof. Evil does, and you all win Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time.&#10;&#10;"

This will be the first dungeon that the players will take turns exploring.&#10;&#10;Next deal out three equipment cards at random to each player. This is your starting equipment. Players are free to look at these cards. You can place them either face up or face down on the table in front of you. Playing with them face down adds a bit of additional suspense to the game since other players won&rsquo;t know if you have the equipment needed to get past a particular encounter until you reveal it.&#10;&#10;Now you&rsquo;re ready to play.&#10;&#10;Taking a Turn:&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of turns. A player starts their turn with 6 action points or APs. Once its decided who goes first, players one begins their dash through the dungeon. They select and flip over any card on the 5 X 5 dungeon grid, then subtract the AP cost of that card from their remaining APs. In some cases, like flipping over the Pit Trap, the card may tell you that you must &ldquo;lose all remaining AP and end turn&rdquo; which means you&rsquo;re turn is done. Some equipment cards, like the Float-Up Potion, can be used to cancel out these cards. A card that&rsquo;s canceled in this way costs 0 AP. Some equipment cards can also be used to reduce the AP cost of certain cards, like Bandage, or even reduce them to 0, like Freeze Bomb. Your turn ends when your AP reaches 0 or you flip over a Treasure. When your turn ends you take any cards you flipped over, keeping Treasure cards separate from the other dungeon cards.&#10;&#10;Then it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn to explore. Players continue until all the cards of the first dungeon have been flipped over. When the last card is flipped, the AP of the player who flipped it is reduced to 0 and their turn ends.&#10;&#10;Another 4 X 5 grid of Dungeon Cards are then laid out and the next player&rsquo;s turn begins. Play continues in this order until a total of three dungeons have been explored.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;&#10;Once all three dungeons have been explored players add up the value of their treasure cards.

Charioteers can whip and ram their opponents to hinder them during the race (to the crowd&rsquo;s delight). The gods are watching, too, along with the tens of thousands in the crowd, and they may be inclined to influence the race in their favor!&#10;&#10;So strap yourself into your chariot, ready your whip, and pay tribute to Caesar in Chariots of Rome!&#10;&#10;"

It is the awful day that his father is lost at sea, and despite great grandma Tess' belief in the power of the dandelion wishes, Jack knows no amount of magic will bring him back &mdash; but he tries anyway.&#10;&#10;Nothing happens&hellip;&#10;&#10;In an act of rage, Jack sets in motion a series of events that transports him to the true kingdom of Mourne: a realm half-real, half-imagined that's filled with all manner of fantastical creatures. Jack encounters Cobs, a 437-year old clurichaun (don't call him a leprechaun) who lives alone in a creaky old mansion perched on top of a tree that grows within a tree. Soon Jack learns that his tampering with the long forgotten magic of Mourne has stirred something deep within the heart of the mountains. An ancient wall encircles the center of the Kingdom, a wall that has held strong for centuries, but now the evil it was built to imprison has a plan to escape.&#10;&#10;The Nightmares &mdash; the deepest fears from the darkest corners of Irish Legend &mdash; are being called from their slumber. From the four corners of the Kingdom they come. Their one aim: to tear down the wall and set the Old Ones' Shimnavore free.&#10;&#10;In MourneQuest, a 2-4 player cooperative board game based on the novel MourneQuest by Irish author Garry McElherron, heroes Jack, Cobs, and their friends must battle to banish the Nightmares and save the Kingdom of Mourne. As they race towards their goal, they gather power from the land itself, with granite, blackthorn, flax and gold fueling their quest and magical items to boost their skills. But even the BogBeans, the normally elusive faerie folk of the dark forests and marshlands, seem set to block their path.&#10;&#10;Together the heroes face an epic struggle to escape the BogBeans, dispel the Nightmares, and finally defeat the Shimnavore.&#10;&#10;"

In this edition you are fighting for the supremacy in the western Mediterranean and Western Europe, the geographical area which the Romans and Byzantines designated as Occident. In the western Mediterranean powers, the Greeks, the Carthagians and the Romans compete for hegemony; in the north are powerful nations such as the Celts, Germans, and Dacians, who, if they are not at war to each other, aspire to the warm, sweet and rich regions of the South. The Iberians fight for their own survival. It was the time shortly after the Celtic storm on Rome, done by Brennus and after the death of Alexander the Great. It was the period of the Punic wars, followed by the beginning of the Germanic invasions of the Cimbri and Teutones, which once again placed Rome at a great danger. They were defeated only by consul Marius after his military reforms. Now you play for the supremacy in the Occident in those last pre-Christian centuries, in which the gates of the Roman Temple of Janus were only closed once. Choose your people and win!&#10;&#10;While playing, you have to successfully develop several skills to win, namely those of a military strategist, a prudent economist and a skilled diplomat. Increase your empire revenue through urban development, conquests and through your navy, which dominates the trade revenue in sea zones. Use your diplomats and support your army leaders or trade with other players, instigate revolts, gain neutral provinces peacefully, manipulate the opposing army commander, or send huge sums of money to support your allies. Secure your domains by garrison troops and fortifications. Build powerful armies, recruit the best of your people to increase the performance of your army, and develop strategies to force your powerful enemies to their knees. Hope, that Fortuna favors you. May the gods be with you!&#10;&#10;Reach the supremacy of your nation in the Occident. You can achieve this dominance by leading the victory-chart at the end of 8 rounds or you can eliminate one of your adversaries in a Deathmatch by conquering his last province. Several winners in different order categories are possible. If a last province of an opponent has been conquered by your army, you place one of your markers on the skulls on the game board. No matter how the game evolves, you are one of the game winners, as long as you do not lose your last province, too. Any player remains in the game until he has completely lost his last province (does not apply to the nation of BRITANNIA, they stay always in the game!)&#10;&#10;"

Players furiously attack each other and defend themselves in order to be the last ninja standing. Each card can be used in attack or defence and placed in the Head, Body or Legs position depending on it's tabs. There is an Active Character Token (or A.C.T.) which signifies the active player. On receiving this you draw one card and can play one card on the players sitting next to you. They then have to block this attack with a card of their own OR give you a hit token (you have 3 of these in the standard game). When you lose a hit token you recharge your hand back up to 5 cards. Lose all 3 and you are defeated.&#10;&#10;There are three special indicators which can appear on the cards and these signify 'Flurry', 'Riposte' or 'Ninja Star' cards. When a Flurry card is played in an attack you immediately draw another card and can play another attack card. If another Flurry card is played then you draw and play another attack and so on...&#10;&#10;When a Riposte is played in a defence you immediately draw another card and can play an attack card on the player your attacker. If a Flurry card is played then its free second attack can hit any valid player.&#10;&#10;The third type of card is the Ninja Star which can attack anyone.&#10;&#10;Flurry and Riposte cards chain without limit which means your games get very hectic very quickly.

Sometimes it is better to take the damage, lose a hit token, recharge your hand and come out swinging.&#10;&#10;"
