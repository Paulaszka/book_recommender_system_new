It uses the 4&times;4 holes board and 30 balls of the set. The game consists of three variants, created together, at the same time: &quot;mint and liquorice candies&quot;, &quot;sugar candies&quot; and &quot;mint, liquorice and cherry candies (aka the poisoned candy)&quot;.&#10;&#10;Mint and liquorice candies&#10;In the &ldquo;mint and liquorice candies&rdquo; variant the balls are 15 white (mint candies) and 15 black (liquorice candies).&#10;Rules&#10;Set up: a player places a mint candy and the other a liquorice candy until the pyramid (the cake) is complete. The candies can be placed either on empty board holes or stacking on 2x2 platforms of existing candies.&#10;Game: the game starts when the cake is complete. Players take turns eating (removing) a candy, either mint or liquorice, or a line of mint and liquorice candies. The candies forming the line can be removed, one-by-one, in any desired order. &#10;A line is a straight group (in 3D) of at least two tastes touching candies, either orthogonally if they are in the same level or one on top of the other if they are in different levels. The lines don't wrap around corners or edges (since in this case they are not really straight when you consider the 3D space).&#10;The player who eats the last candy loses the game.&#10;&#10;Sugar candies&#10;The &ldquo;sugar candies&rdquo; variant of the game uses 30 balls, randomly selected among the whole Shibumi set of 16 white balls, 16 black balls and 16 red balls.&#10;Rules&#10;The game starts with all the 30 candies placed to form the complete square pyramid (the cake). Players take turns eating (removing) a candy or a line of touching candies. The candies forming the line can be removed, one-by-one, in any desired order.&#10;A line is a straight group (in 3D) of at least two touching candies, either orthogonally if they are in the same level or one on top of the other if they are in different levels. The lines don't wrap around corners or edges (since in this case they are not really straight when you consider the 3D space).&#10;The player who eats the last candy loses the game.&#10;&#10;Mint, liquorice and cherry candies (aka the poisoned candy)&#10;In the mint, liquorice and cherry candies variant of the game the balls are 15 white (mint candies), 14 black (liquorice candies) and one red ball (cherry candy).&#10;Rules&#10;Set up: a player places a mint candy and the other a liquorice candy till the 29th candy, then the cherry candy is placed on the top of the pyramid (the cake). The candies can be placed either on empty board holes or stacking on 2x2 platforms of existing candies.&#10;Game: the game starts when the cake is complete. Players take turns eating (removing) a candy, either mint or liquorice, or a line of mint and liquorice candies.

The lines don't wrap around corners or edges (since in this case they are not really straight when you consider the 3D space).&#10;The player who eats the cherry candy loses the game (and, if it is poisoned, the life, too!).&#10;&#10;Notes&#10;According to the Shibumi drop mechanism, when a ball is removed, then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. &#10;Due to the drop mechanism and to the possibility to remove a straight group of balls, one-by-one, a ball of the line that you want to remove, pinned at the beginning of the move, can become unpinned during the move after the removal of another ball of the group, thus allowing its removing. The players are not forced to remove full lines, i.e. the longest lines in that direction.&#10;&#10;Online play&#10;&#10;Special cake can be played online (real time) at igGameCenter - http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/sandboxshibumi.html&#10;&#10;"

Each corporation collects and trades resources, makes bets on the stock market and can battle other players. The goal is to be the corporation with the highest score at the end of the game session. There are also individual goals (called Legend Trials) and many other accolades for achievements throughout the game, such as being the first to build a star base.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into four phases with slightly different rules and prerequisites. Each card in the game has four different functions: as ship part, as cybernetic upgrade, natural resource and combat maneuver.

The recommended number of players for ideal play (as specified by the game designers themselves) is 5.&#10;&#10;Only 2 of the players are actually referred to as &quot;Players&quot;, with the rest being called &quot;Spectators&quot; - a misleading name considering that the &quot;spectators&quot; control the movement of the pieces as much as do the &quot;players&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the normal 8x8 checkered board with all of the normal piece figurines.  The goal of the game is also the same: to check-mate the opponent's piece normally called the King.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the 6 figure/piece types are allocated by some means between the spectators.  The spectators take physical possession of all pieces of their type or types while they decide what rules shall govern their allowable movements, methods of capture, and any other consequences.  These rules are kept secret from both players as well as all other spectators.  The only constraint on the spectators' rules is that they must attempt to make the game playable.  Once the spectators have made their decisions, they place the pieces on the board in the normal starting configuration (with some variation possible if the rules for a piece are incompatible with its normal starting position).  Spectators then announce new names for their pieces.  Names may be designed to try to help players guess the piece's rules.&#10;&#10;In Penultima, black goes first.  On a Player's turn, he or she can pick any of his or her pieces and move it anywhere on the board.  Then the Spectator allocated to that piece will do one of three things: &#10;  1) They will allow the piece to remain where it is, declaring the move to be legal, but without consequence.  &#10;  2) They may allow the piece to remain where it is, declaring the move legal, but will alter the positions of other pieces and/or remove pieces from play (and possibly say &quot;check&quot;) to enact the consequence of the move. (As the game progresses, Players may learn the rules regarding capturing or moving other pieces and may act out these consequences themselves.  If they act out a consequence incorrectly, the Spectator will correct the error.) &#10;  3) They will return the moved piece to its starting position, declaring the move illegal.&#10;&#10;"

The fertility goddess Haumea has blessed these islands, and they are rich with fruits, vegetables, and spices. It is a matter of pride to collect the finest harvest for the village.

Players seed the islands each turn giving them some control over where crops replenish. Once the archipelago is formed, the late season is triggered when crops start becoming scarce, with players occasionally stopping an island from producing altogether. Although the late season may not be as good for crops, fishing becomes easier with bonuses given to the waters around some of the islands.&#10; During all this the players travel by Wa&rsquo;a from island to island using action points to collect the crops they want or can get to before the others take them. As the Wa&rsquo;a fills, it becomes slower limiting the number of actions they have. There are also treacherous reefs around the islands that require you go around them or risk losing some of the crops aboard your Wa&rsquo;a.

On a turn, the player takes the top card and looks at the picture and the text on the other side of the card. From this, he or she must guess the correct historical period for the card e.g. L&eacute;onard de Vinci would be a La Renaissance card. Then check the summary card. If correct, he scores a point. If not, the card is discarded and the opponent has a turn. When all the cards have been used, the one with the most points, wins.&#10;&#10;Game 2: L'ordre chronologique&#10;Cards are dealt out evenly. The remaing cards are placed in a stack. A card is revealed and the player must lay a card that goes immediately before the date on that card or just after it. If you cannot play a card, you must pass and take a card from the stack and add it to your hand. The first player to use all their cards, wins.&#10;&#10;Game 3: Qui suis-je?&#10;Stack all the cards with only the picture side showing.
