The game involves selection, bowling, batting, and active fielding, allowing for short over fast action games through to the complex realms of strategy found in test play. Although, like with cricket itself, the basics are simple and easily learnt, it will inevitably take a lifetime to master.&#10;&#10;No prior knowledge of cricket is needed to play the game which is suitable for the whole family and up to 22 players. In essence the side that scores the most &quot;runs&quot; wins, though selecting the right players, the order they play, and where they are positioned all affect the outcome of the game. The basics of Wicked Wickets are really quite simple; the bowler throws the ball, in this case the red ball shaped die, and the batsman &quot;hits&quot; it by throwing the buff bat-shaped die. Adding the scores together shows how far the ball goes using the long flight measure. If the batsman's score is higher than the bowlers, the ball &quot;flies&quot; in the air; if the bowler's score is higher than the batsman's, then it is struck along the ground. The yellow counter and dice are used to show which direction the ball goes. The short pace measure is simply used to measure the distance players move and the green die is mostly used for fielding. The game cards give the individual abilities of the players affecting how and where they are used. However, as with most games there is often more to it than first meets the eye. --From the publisher&#10;&#10;Official website: http://www.boadiceasbackyard.com/&#10;&#10;"

The 100-card deck contains fifty creatures with different characteristics that determine how the creature interacts with the orbs (throw accuracy, catching ability, and throwing range), how fast a creature can move, and how effective it is in battle. Many creatures also have unique magic abilities that can be used to manipulate gameplay.&#10;&#10;When players summon creatures, corresponding creature tokens (miniature cards that stand erect in cardstands) enter the 20x20 square gameboard, known as the Arena, where the orb and portal tokens await the contestants. In a four-player game, players may compete in teams of two. Goals are scored by creatures that maneuver an orb token onto a portal token by picking up, carrying, handing off, and throwing the orb with their creature tokens. Additionally, players can score goals (known as Skins) by successfully destroying opponents' creatures in combat. Combat results are determined by dice rolls as are the success of throws and catches of the orb between creatures. A number of Alter Reality cards allow players to change the values of individual rolls which make the outcome of every roll something that can quickly be challenged.&#10;&#10;Enchantment cards can be played on creatures to grant them enhanced stats or new abilities as well as make them hardier in combat. Event cards, such a Lightning Storms or Fumbles can change the flow the game in seconds forcing players to constantly rethink their strategies for scoring or engaging in combat.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player or team reaches three goals, one of which must be a non-skins goal.
