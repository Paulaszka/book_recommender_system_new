A player from the other team draws a card and reads it aloud. The players in the group with the answer cards write down the name of the player that fits the most. They are NOT allowed to communicate. At the end of the hourglass, the players turn their cards around. If they all wrote the same name, they win the card. The group with most cards at the end wins.&#10;&#10;"

If you can match all of the icons on a reward, discard the supplies and take the reward, which will be valued between 4-7 points; however, the only way to get more of the necessary supplies is to sell a reward by flipping it face down and drawing as many supply cards as the card's point value. This will reduce the points for the card from face-value to only 1, so make sure you only sell rewards when you need to. And make sure you don't have more than 10 supplies at the end of your turn or you'll need to discard!&#10;&#10;Keep up this simple loop, deciding at every turn whether you'll need an extra supply or an extra point to win.

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.&#10;&#10;Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.&#10;&#10;"

The buyer's guide gives an up-to-date survey of the wealth of ranges of miniatures available and advice on which are compatible with which. Organizational tables give a breakdown of typical formations for all the major combatants and most of the minor ones (any one for a Wurttemburg infantry division?), allowing you to structure your collection and also to organize hypothetical games quickly with 'off the peg' orders of battle. Three historical scenarios are also included, each with their own specific orders of battle, maps, objectives and victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The rules themselves, which utilize an innovative card-driven turn sequence to simulate the unpredictable ebb and flow of battle, are designed for playability, while still giving 'realistic' results and rewarding sound tactics. Though designed primarily for division level games with 25 or 15mm figures, the command and control sysyem takes account of corps or even the largest army level games and they are easily adaptable to any figure scale.&#10;&#10;Get ready to march to the sound of the guns!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Then you may either fulfill the order of a ship on your shores or claim a business from a shared display and place it onto your island (or do nothing). Clever planning and timing is vital because until you supply the ships on your shores, they block valuable island space which could be used to collect more fruit &mdash; but if you concentrate too much on the ships, the most promising businesses may get snatched by your opponents. Also, the sooner businesses are claimed, the quicker the game might end.&#10;&#10;With each play, Juicy Fruits poses new puzzles of how to move your tokens efficiently and how to balance clearing your island with claiming businesses.

There, on some lonely island, safe from the eyes of all except an occasional Indian, those planes could be assembled and made ready for an attack on the Soo ship canal. &mdash;&mdash; Lieutenant Colonel Harold A. Furlong, February 1942.&#10;&#10;Hitting Home is an introductory level game about Axis raids on the Soo Locks during WWII. The Soo Locks were a crucial choke point for the shipment of all of the iron ore used by US and Canadian steel mills. Air raids by German and Japanese aircraft were planned by all sides.&#10;&#10;Although never carried out, strikes against this crucial Home Front installation could have had a profound impact on the war&rsquo;s outcome. Hitting Home allows players to explore the &ldquo;what if&rdquo; of German or Japanese attacks against the Soo Locks.&#10;&#10;The 1942 scenario portrays a German attack using disguised merchant ships to transport Heinkel (He) 115 and 114 floatplane bombers to Hudson Bay. There the aircraft would have been unloaded, armed and taken off to attack the Soo Locks about 600 miles to the south and west. Since the range of the He-114 aircraft would be insufficient for the planes to make a return trip back to the transports, it is assumed the planes would have landed in a lake on the return leg and been picked up by the larger He-115 or other floatplanes designated for search and rescue.&#10;&#10;The 1945 scenario portrays an attack launched from two Japanese I-400 attack submarines. These massive submarines carried three Aichi M6A bombers in hangers. The bombers were launched from a catapult that ran along the top of the ship&rsquo;s bow. It is assumed 4 of these bombers would be used in the attack (based on the presumption that it would be very remarkable for all 3 of a submarine&rsquo;s aircraft to be operational at the same time).&#10;&#10;&mdash;based on description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Will you be competing to see who can name the dish that other players most want to eat right now? Will you each pretend to be sick to see whose illness looks the most real? If the players vote for the champ, the champ scores points, but they keep those points only if they voluntarily step down from their position. If the challenger wins, then the champ loses all of their banked points.&#10;&#10;How bold are you feeling, champ?&#10;&#10;"
