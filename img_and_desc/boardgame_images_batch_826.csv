Traditional standalone games usually make you pick one: they're either easy to pick up, but don't have enough gameplay to keep experienced players engaged; or they're loaded with depth, but tough to get into.  That's So Wrong: Caveman edition was designed to keep experienced gamers entertained, while maintaining simplicity so new players can jump right in.&#10;&#10;Players start the game by building their tribe from a random set of 4 caveman. Once all players have done this, players can send their caveman out to the &quot;wild&quot; to fetch items which in turn help make your tribe stronger. Conflicts happen when your caveman and another player's choose the same item, cave woman, event, caves to live in, or dinosaurs to hunt. If this happens conflicts begin and are resolved by looking at the text of the card. Follow the simple instructions to determine the winner. Winners take the prized possessions back to their tribe.&#10;&#10;Certain cavemen and items are better at accomplishing different tasks. Some cavemen are good at hunting, some are good at finding love with the cave-ladies, and others are less practical. Some are even perfect for winning conflicts.&#10;&#10;Cavemen who successfully accomplish their mission by being uncontested or winning a conflict become exhausted and they (and their spoils of discovery) are unable to be sent back out again until the following turn. Managing who is exhausted and how many cards are in your hand (which can be expanded with the discovery of a new home/cave) is important to claim victory. As your tribe grows rich with items, powerful dinosaur hunts, cave-woman, and pets you'll be able to win more conflicts and cause more mayhem for other players.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players add up the value of the cards they've collected and a winner may emerge.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Once everyone has completed their zoos, players score 1 point for each visitor next to an enclosure tile, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;You can increase the difficulty level of WonderZoo by having players start with certain squares blocked, and you can add advanced scoring rules as well, with the yellow visitor granting 2 points when next to a yellow enclosure.&#10;&#10;"
