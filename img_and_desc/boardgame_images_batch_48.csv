5529,,"Although billed as a game for Ages 12 and up, this is a very simple roll-and-move game where the object is to make a round trip on a track that represents the Alaska Highway. It starts in Dawson Creek, B.C., goes through Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska and then returns to Dawson Creek.&#10;&#10;Spaces are either blank, have an instruction to follow, or have you pick one of two types of cards which then give you instructions to follow.&#10;&#10;"

5535,,"The object of the game is to be the first Inspector (the players are all Clouseaus) to catch the Pink Panther four times, thus putting him in the pokey and out of circulation.&#10;&#10;The Pink Panther starts in the inner track and rolls two dice; the players start on the outer track and roll one die.  Note that the Pink Panther moves on each player's turn.  Whenever the Pink Panther lands on a &quot;Trapped?&quot; space, a die against die check is made, re-rolling ties; if red is higher than white, the Pink Panther escapes.  Otherwise the player gets a Pink Panther card.&#10;&#10;The players can enter the inner track, triggering &quot;Trapped?&quot; checks as before.  The risk, however, is that by landing on an &quot;Escapes?&quot; space, the player may lose a Pink Panther card (this isn't as bad as it sounds, since the space gives a card as often as it takes one).  If both the Pink Panther and the player land on an &quot;Escapes?&quot;/&quot;Trapped?&quot; space simultaneously, this is considered an automatic Escape/Capture.&#10;&#10;On an &quot;Escapes?&quot; space, if you have two or more Pink Panther cards, you may go for the &quot;Big Chance&quot;.  This is a die check as above, the stakes being all of your Pink Panther cards against instant victory.&#10;&#10;"

5541,,"On June 22, 1941, before dawn, German tanks and guns began firing across the Russian border. It was the beginning of Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, one of the most brutal campaigns in the history of warfare. Four years later, the victorious Red Army has suffered a loss of seven million lives. &#10;The Barbarossa campaign included some of the greatest episodes in military history: the futile attack on Moscow in the winter of 1941-42, the siege of Stalingrad, the great Russian offensive beginning in 1944 that would lead the Red Army to the historic meeting with the Americans at the Elbe and on to victory in Berlin.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa is not simply one game but it is composed of three different types of games.&#10;1) The Standard Games: There are four of these games. They depict specific situations of crucial parts of the war&#10;2)The Campaign Game: It combines the four afforementioned games and fill in the gaps so that the campaign can be played out in sequence&#10;3)The Variable situations: Several &quot;what if&quot; historical effects are examined when added to the above games.&#10;&#10;The Game includes a 23&quot; by 29&quot; map sheet that portrays the area os the Soviet Union in which the operations took place.&#10;A hexagonal grid is superimposed upon the map to regularize the movement and the position of the playing pieces.&#10;The combat map is all inclusive with a Terrain Effects Chart (TEC) and Combat Results Table(CRT)&#10;There are two types of units each repressenting one of the opposing armies.Each piece is distinguished by type strenght nationality and mobolity.&#10;&#10;How To Play&#10;Each player moves his Units and executes attacks in turn.Players have as an objective to destroy the enemy units and gaining territory whilst minimizing friendly unit loses.&#10;The combat is resolved by comparing attack and defence strengths of adjacent opposing units and expressing the comparison as a simplified probability ratio(odds)&#10;After the defender has chosen which CRT table will be used a die is rolled and the outcome indicated by cross referencing the die roll result and the odds column is applied to the unit being attacked.&#10;Barbarossa is played in turns.&#10;Each Game-turn is composed of two player turns that are divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;"

5544,,"The game is played on a 24X24 grid that has 24 areas designated as 'mobster hideouts'.  In each of the hideouts a scoring marker (a small cardboard gun inserted into a random scoring base which varies in points from 1,000 to 5,000 points) is placed face down so that none of the players know the values beforehand.&#10;&#10;Each player (up to four) is given a set of 30 tiles on which is printed a 'chain' (or in game terms... a police cordon).  Tiles must be placed on the grid so that the 'chain' is continued.  Certain squares on the board provide an additional turn.&#10;&#10;When the 'chain' forms a closed loop and encloses one or more 'mobster hideouts', the player who closed the loop takes the scoring markers for all of the hideouts inside the loop.  Placement within the loop is now forbidden and any tiles that exist within the loop are returned to their owner.&#10;&#10;When all 24 hideouts have been surrounded, the player who encircled the last hideout gets 1,000 bonus points.  Players add up the values of all the mobsters that they captured and the one with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

To participate in the national you must first compete in a local tournament.&#10;&#10;The British World Marbles Championship, run by the British Marble Control Board, has been held every Good Friday in Tinsley Green, England, since at least the 1600's. It often hosts teams from other countries.&#10;&#10;All the marbles are placed inside a circle drawn in the dirt. The object is to get all of them out. Take turns propelling your shooter marble from the circle's edge at the marbles in the middle. When the marbles are all outside of the circle, you count up the ones you have put there. The winner is the one with the most marbles. Some play that this person takes all the marbles.&#10;&#10;Some play that if the shooter marble leaves the circle during the shot the marbles knocked out by that shot are put back in.&#10;&#10;"

Players keep going until a set time limit is reached (I suggest at least 2 hours) or when the there is only one player left in the game (if played without descendants).  If descendants are being used, the game is never ending and can go on indefinitely.&#10;&#10;The highs and lows of society are portrayed by spaces on the board.  Businesses may be bought and sold, players may get a higher education, join a Co-op, become a thief, enter the military, etc.&#10;&#10;An additional random element is in the form of 'Change' cards.  With the draw of a card you can become an alcoholic, get busted and sent to prison, become a parent of quintuplets, etc.  Because there are only 54 of these cards, they seem to come up again and again... expecially when six are playing.&#10;&#10;Elections make the game the most fun.  During an election, players are encouraged to put issues to a vote... majority rules.  This allows aspects of the game rules to be changed or outright ingored!  Because of this, interesting things can happen, for example: elimination of taxes or a military coup d'etat.&#10;&#10;"

5554,,"Die Nacht der Vampire is a casual game with a vampire hunting theme.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of a vampire hunter entering the grounds of Castle Gruselstein, Count Dracula's castle. The board features a unique, 3D design with one half the board containing the castle grounds and the other half containing the castle stairs and castle. The castle stairway is a molded plastic insert into the board with slots on each stair for the vampires to stand in vertically. At the back edge of the stairway, a cutout for the castle itself rises vertically from the board.&#10;&#10;The game setup includes populating the castle stairs with 11 vampires (6 castle guests, and 5 butlers). On each player's turn, they can take one of three actions: 1. Move their vampire hunter, then move the vampires, 2. Draw hunt cards, then move the vampires, or 3. Move the vampires, and then throw a garlic clove.&#10;&#10;Moving the vampires involves turning over a vampire card and sliding the number of vampires the number of spaces indicated on the designated rows.&#10;&#10;If the player throws a garlic clove, they declare how many hunt cards they would like to use, and then they turn over hunt cards one at a time. The hunt cards either move the garlic clove toward the vampires on the stair within the column or forces both the hunter and clove backward. If the clove reaches a vampire, the vampire is captured, removed from the stair, and replaced from the supply. When all vampires in the supply are exhausted, the Count is brought out.&#10;&#10;When the Count is captured, the game is over and the player with the most points in captured vampires wins.&#10;&#10;"

The square 'Grub Stake' cards are placed into slots on the wall to allow a players figure to ascend the mountain.&#10;&#10;Movement is by roll of two dice which may be split amongst any of your three figures.

5560,,"Based on the popular comic strip, Steve Canyon, this game lets up to four players fly their F-105 Thunderchiefs to three different air bases. The first person to complete this circuit wins.&#10;&#10;Very luck driven, in that a roll of one die determines movement on the map and also altitude increments of 1,000 ft. Player choices amount to deciding what altitude to fly and which air field to visit next.&#10;&#10;Random weather cards cause problems while flying over certain areas of the board or flying through certain altitudes. Fuel consumption is basically one unit every time the die is rolled, and running out of fuel can force a landing at an emergency air field or cause a pilot to bail out.&#10;&#10;The game is interesting because of the scale plastic planes used as playing pieces (actual reproductions of the F-105) and in the cardboard 'control panels' which players use to keep track of altitude and fuel. The rules also include a two-page insert describing &quot;the world's most powerful one-man airplane&quot; in detail.&#10;&#10;"

5576,,"'Dungeoneer - Perilous Adventures in an Ever-Changing Labyrinth.&#10;&#10;In Dungeoneer', you take up the mantle of a great Hero set out to prove your valor in the Tomb of the Lich Lord. To triumph over your rivals, you will need to explore the labyrinth of corridors, defeat the heinous monsters, overcome nefarious traps and be the first to complete all your Quests. But beware, the gods are fickle and to test their Heroes even further, they often bestow upon them Banes as well as Boons.&#10;&#10;Game Description:&#10;&#10;This simple card game is very reminiscent of Wiz-War. Players are dealt one of 4 Heroes, each with varying movement, fighting and magic abilities. The Dwarf for example is very tough, but has no magic value at all. Each Hero also has a value for hit points, the amount of Treasure he can have (carry) at any time and also the number of &quot;Boons&quot; (special abilities) he may have. Players are dealt 3 quest cards initially in front of them (public knowledge) and have 5 Adventure cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Each turn a player may:&#10;&#10;     Discard unwanted cards and draw back to 5 cards.&#10;     Play Encounters and/or Bane cards (always on opponents never on yourself).&#10;     Build the Dungeon.&#10;     Move (collect Peril and Glory tokens).&#10;&#10;&#10;Players will collect Peril tokens as they move which then makes them targets for others to play Encounter/Bane cards against them (Encounter/Bane cards have a fee to play - which is paid for by the person who the card is played ON with Peril tokens). This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.&#10;&#10;Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.&#10;&#10;Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).&#10;&#10;The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.&#10;&#10;This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca. There are several planned expansions, and two special cards available by mail if you purchased at the convention.&#10;&#10;First game in the Dungeoneer Series.&#10;&#10;"

5594,,"Airline is a very simple 'roll and move' game with a few twists.&#10;&#10;Players are competing airlines trying to collect money for 'landing rights' at various cities around the world.  You can only collect this money if you have a &quot;route&quot; (either direct or indirect) from your home city.  Players start with $100,000,000.&#10;&#10;Money collected for landing rights varies depending on the size of your airline, indicated by the playing piece (prop, jet, or SST) that you have in play. Once paid, the landing rights to a city may be challenged by paying the owner an additional $20,000,000 and then rolling the dice... high dice wins (ties go to the current owner). If a player cannot pay a debt, he is bankrupt and out of the game.&#10;&#10;Play continues until only one player is left and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

When time is up, clipboards are passed to the left, and the process repeats. The challenge increases with each round, as players must come up with new answers that haven&rsquo;t already been written by others.&#10;&#10;After all clipboards return to their original owners, scores are tallied based on valid, non-duplicate answers. Creativity, speed, and lateral thinking are key to claiming victory in this word-filled whirlwind. Perfect for parties or family game nights, Commotion rewards clever thinking and quick recall under pressure.&#10;&#10;"

Somewhat of a knock-off, it is the sequel to The Lords of Underearth and is based on Metagaming's Melee, Wizard and The Fantasy Trip rules sets.

It does not offer much for those who already have the Advanced Melee, Advanced Wizard, and In The Labyrinth, other than counters and some rules for Explosive Gems that were omitted from Advanced Wizard, but may be useful to those who only have the Melee and Wizard rules booklets, and want a few new weapons and spells that are not found there.&#10;&#10;"

Focuses on air to air and air to ground combat during the Battle of Britain with some before (Battle of France) and some afterward (Western Europe through 1942).&#10;&#10;Mechanics are based on fairly realistic energy physics.  Aircraft capabilities modeled closely on differences between the performance of the aircraft.  A turn represents 4.1 seconds; a hex represents 100 yards.&#10;&#10;The game system is more complex than the other games of this type of combat such as Mustangs or Dauntless/Air Force Dauntless Expansion Kit.&#10;&#10;The system includes an operational scale to handle flying an entire mission.&#10;&#10;

Full set of team cards were available for the 1973 to 1976 seasons. No cards were issued for 1977 to 1979 seasons. Then resumed from 1980 season cards to 1987 season cards  There are fan made sets available.&#10;&#10;Individual team and player cards were statistically accurate.  The entire twenty game schedule (including pre-season) could be played out.&#10;&#10;This game allows you to pick a CFL team and individual offensive players for the various positions of the offense.  Players cards are rated for the player's abilities during that season.  You select running and passing plays and actually use the player stats.  For example you roll to see if Warren Moon completes a pass and then roll a die on Brian Kelly's card to see how many yards he gets.  Same with kickers and punters etc.  The game flow gives a very good simulation of a CFL game.&#10;&#10;
