Make your purr&hellip; uhm, better!&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).&#10;&#10;The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:&#10;1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side&#10;2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)&#10;3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)&#10;4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)&#10;5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)&#10;&#10;The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.&#10;&#10;Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.&#10;&#10;The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.&#10;&#10;The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.&#10;&#10;This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.&#10;&#10;This is a new version of Oppai Go that is stand alone but can be combined with the previous game to extend games up to 5-6 players.&#10;&#10;"

To begin a turn, a player takes one of his pieces and captures-via-replacement some enemy piece. Some aspect of the capture provides a template whereby the piece may perform further captures. The template can be the minimal bounding box containing the move, the directions used to achieve the capture, or even the number of friendly pieces in the line-of-sight. Burrow is meant to be a game system and the only presiding rules, aside from the objective of annihilation, are that the template informs all further captures, that the capturing piece must keep moving until it has no available capture according to its template and the mechanism of movement must allow unlimited translation in both dimensions of the board in making the initial capture. Also the game is played on an 8x8 board with a regular alternating pattern of pieces. I invite anyone to put on their designing caps and suggest their own Burrow games. Here are some of my own.&#10;&#10;Note: as a general rule in these 4 Burrow games there is no jumping over pieces of any color. However in others jumping may be allowed.&#10;&#10;Box Burrow: this is closest to the original. In Box Burrow the template is the minimal bounding box containing the capture with the capturing piece's initial position, and the initial piece to be captured being at opposite corners. A Further convention is that the capture is achieved by a number of orthogonal steps. Further captures can be made, as long as for each, movement is entirely within a bounding box of equivalent dimension and as with the first capture the next piece to be captured is at its opposite corner.&#10;&#10;Sweep Burrow: By far the easiest of the variants so far, Sweep Burrow's template is simply the two orthogonal directions involved in making the initial capture. The only further convention here is that if the capture was made with just movement in one direction, you cannot employ a second direction.&#10;&#10;Tumburrow: Tumburrow has the most distinctive template of these. The template is to count the number of friendly pieces (aside from the capturing piece itself) a queen's move away from the first capture. The other convention is that every capture must only involve movement in no more than two directions (orthogonal and diagonal) however these directions do not provide template data.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The player reads the situation in the book and chooses his action, which leads him to another section of the story. You roam the world drawing the map and exploring various locations. Sometimes your way will be bloodthirsty enemies. Then a confrontation begins, which is a tactical part of the game and is carried out on the board, with the participation of battle maps, minis, and dice.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics is based on 2 six side dice. Facing difficult situation you will be asked to roll against one of your attributes. The result leads you to appropriate text section, but don't worry - the story gives you a lot of possibilities to increase your stats.&#10;&#10;The combat is most often resolved on the one of nine battle maps. First Thymin moves and attacks. Then each of the enemies moves and attacks.  The greater the difference between the attributes of the attacker and the defender, the greater the chance of hitting and the amount of damage. You can also use special combat actions, weapons, items or take advantage of the terrain.&#10;&#10;Exploring the world you consistently develop your character, which helps you to win the battles, resolve quests and finally reach your goal.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

In this game, different action cards recreate varied kinds of orders and battle events, that allow every match to be unique and to any combat to be epic, unpredictable and exciting.  ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm).&#10;&#10;Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants. Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements. Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated; meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.&#10;&#10;Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort.

Moving from a Jack, players must remain in that Jack&rsquo;s column.&#10;&#10;Once a player has moved to a new card, they initiate a Jest, except when moving back to a Joker.&nbsp; When a Jest takes place, each player must play a a card matching the color of the In addition to each face card having a different movement rule, they also have their own Winning Jest Scores, and Win Results. Unless the players happen to be on the same card, only the initiator (the one who moved onto the new card), may gain the Win Result for that Jest.&nbsp; When moving to a King, the player who plays the highest car, wins. The initiator may gain one Quip Point for winning.&nbsp; If a player moves to a Queen, the lowest card wins, and the initiator may gain a Favor Token for winning.&nbsp; Finally, on a Jack, the initiating player decides whether high of low will win, before the players play their cards.&nbsp; When the initiator wins on a Jack, they may take away a point of their choosing, either a Favor Token or Quip Point. If there are none to take, the initiating player gains a Favor Token instead.&nbsp; The end game trigger is when a player reaches six quip points, which is indicated by them turning their die with the six pip face up. The players will then compare scores, and whoever has the most points, Quip points and Favor points, wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Fight out science fiction battles for fun, free of adherence to specific model ranges, canonical settings or ever-expanding supplements.&#10;&#10;Armies are typically composed of around 30-50 models. Most players prefer to field 28mm models, although other scales are just as playable. You can use any miniatures you wish, rather than 'official' ones.&#10;&#10;Xenos Rampant is a completely standalone set of rules, but retains the simplicity, feel, and ease of play of Lion Rampant. Richard originally built Xenos Rampant as an unofficial variant based on Daniel&rsquo;s Origins-nominated system, and we have worked together to develop the idea. The basic rules should be familiar to players of Lion Rampant, although the very different nature of futuristic warfare has necessitated some changes to the rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player has a field comprising cards that have different colours and numbers on each side. Each card's value depends on the colour and number at the top. On your turn you have three actions which you can use to rotate cards and change their value and colour.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has had one turn, the top card is revealed, which has an event to change the game. Then, whoever has the most points from their field with a matching colour wins the card. Players have to plan their cards strategically to win more jewels each round.&#10;&#10;When there are no more cards left, players group their cards based on their colour. Each player counts up their points. Players gain extra points based on the number of cards in each group and for having the same type of jewels in one group. Who ever has the most points at the end wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
