The game features a squirrel piece and a bunch of cone-tokens and a die with numbers from 1 to 3. The board consists of 7 squares each with from 1-5 spots for the cones.On his/her turn the player rolls the die and moves the squirrel in any direction the exact number of squares. If the player lands on a square that's filled with cones then he takes all those tokens into his pool and ends his turn. If he lands on a square that's not yet filled he must place one of his cones on that square. After this he must choose whether to end his turn or take another turn. The game ends when a player lands on a square that's not yet filled and doesn't have any cones left to place. The player with the most cones left is then the winner.&#10;&#10;

Each player controls two characters, a &quot;hero&quot; and a &quot;scoundrel&quot; type, and the goal is to retrieve the Queen's flagship from the Pirate King. Of course, each character has different ways to do that, either by derring-do and combat or by more underhanded methods (if you have enough gold, you could even BRIBE the Pirate King to get the ship back!).

Each Player or team will play the role of Spaceship Commanders and direct their Fleets to either &quot;Near-Space Conquest&quot; or &quot;Worldwide Defeat in the Heavens&quot;. It has two identical game boards. There are four crayons, two each of red and black.  The instructions are printed inside the box top cover. The game boards are quite colorful with a 10 x 10 Target Placement Grid. There are also boxes, denoting the four targets, that you could use to keep track of which of the Enemy Ships has been destroyed.  The targets consist of: 'one Space Battleship of four squares; one Space Cruiser of three squares; and two Space Destroyers of two squares EACH. You draw an enclosed section on the Target Grid consisting of the appropriate number of boxes' of the four Spaceships with their dimensions using the black  crayons for this, and use the red ones to mark off hits and misses on the Monitor Target Tracking Grid. When the Game is finished, you can &quot;Wipe Off&quot; the current markings and you're ready to begin again-hence it's name.&#10;&#10;"

There are also squares numbered 1 - 3; when a defensive piece lands on one of these, the number is added to the offensive player's move total.&#10;&#10;"

Players build up two Mad-Max-type small naval fleets and fight it out.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a fleet of seven ships: one flagship, one battleship, one frigate, two battlecruisers, and two escorts. The five ship types each have specific speeds, armor, weapons, maneuverability and staff morale.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players spend money to improve fleet equipment and staff. A pilot commands each ship and each pilot is given points to  split between Tactics and Leadership attributes. These characteristics are used to modify dice rolls during combat. A more skillful Admiral commands the flagship.&#10;&#10;Each turn is played in one real-time minute. Ship speeds correspond to the physical number of centimeters a ship can move on the table during a turn. Combat is resolved after every ship movement. Depending on ship positions, players can shoot projectiles, ram or board other ships. The success of an attack and the degree of damage are determined by modified dice rolls. Ships sink if their armor score falls below 0 and players overtake ships if there is no more staff on board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one Admiral is captured or dies.&#10;&#10;"

15033,,"A board game for 2-5 players. Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points. At the beginning, every player receives a number of Rangers, which he keeps on his own player board, a plane, and two cards. The back of a card shows how many Rangers you can place in a base and how many dollars you receive. The front of a card shows the region where this base should border on.&#10;&#10;The active player must perform two actions from the following three possibilities:&#10;1) A player may fly his plane to a region and turn up an industry counter (if available). &#10;2) A player may play a card to collect money and/or place Rangers in one base. Should this card have the same color as the region where his plane is, placement is free. Otherwise, a fee of $3 is collected from the player.&#10;3) A player may remove up to four Rangers from the game board back to his or her supply. &#10;Note: A special move is allowed to move any Ranger on the board for a cost of $4.&#10;&#10;You score points by completing nature or industrial projects. Nature projects are completed as soon as the last free base in this region contains at least 1 Ranger. The player who completes the project receives 3 bonus points. Every player with Rangers in a base in this region receives 1 point for every Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Industrial projects are completed as soon as the industry counter is turned over and the surrounding bases contain the required number of Rangers. These projects also provide 3 bonus points and 1 point per Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Points are registered on a scoring track. At the end of the game, each dollar is an extra victory point.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all card piles are exhausted and at least one player has played his last card. The players add their remaining dollars to their scores. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Note: the English rules for the basic game may have an errata. It says draw 9 cards to make stacks, when the non-English rules say draw 8 cards, and the Advanced English rules say draw 9 instead of 8 cards.&#10;&#10;Advanced rules&#10;&#10;A windmill is introduced. When an industry counter with a windmill symbol is turned over, the windmill moves to another region and will add 1 point to its value. Whenever a region is scored, the nature or industry counter is placed on a windmill track. When the windmill track is filled, a windmill scoring round takes place. To score at the windmill, players need to place Rangers on a special Ranger track (instead of placing them in a base, as they normally would do). The player with the most Rangers on the Ranger track receives the value of the windmill in victory points. The second place receives half, the third place receives half of the second place. After the windmill scoring round, the counters on the windmill are removed and the players have to take half of their Rangers on the Ranger track back. Several windmill scoring rounds are possible. At the end of the game, an extra windmill scoring round takes place.&#10;&#10;"
