Spreading involves adding a new piece adjacent to an existing one. Jumping means moving a piece two spaces away. Whenever a piece is placed adjacent to opposing pieces these are infected, meaning replaced with friendly ones. Hexxagon is an adaptation of the game Ataxx for a hexagonal grid instead of a square grid board.

It is played on a board of three rows and three columns. Players have three pieces each and take turns first placing then moving their pieces.

The game comes in a tin box and contains: 224 cards, wooden pieces, 1 plastic chip and rules.&#10;&#10;The game is designed in German and English. One deck has German and English topics, such as Clothing, Holidays, Politics, Ancient Egypt and so on. The deck is written in German and English. The other deck has some letters to start a word and some letters to end a word. So a card might have PE... and ...ING, or it might have T... and ...E and so on. Players have six of these cards face-up in front of them. Three of the Topic cards are dealt up for all to see and then a letters card is turned up.&#10;&#10;As quickly as you can, you make a word fitting one of the topics, starting or ending with a card in your six, and starting or ending with the table card. That is, if you use one of your cards to start a word, then you use the ending from the table card. Or the other way round: if your word starts with the table card, then you use an ending from one of your six.&#10;&#10;The game has two decks for the letters, one in English, one in German. That way, you get the right kind of starting and ending letters to suit your language.&#10;&#10;Players put markers on the Topics with a correct choice, and flip their card they used (worth one point), and draw a fresh table card. When any Topic card gets a third marker, that player gets the Topic card face down (worth three points) and a fresh Topic is drawn. When any player is down to one letter card, there's a special speed round, then the players reset their cards. The game ends after the third speed round.&#10;&#10;It is a simple game idea and yet very challenging to find words and then find how to fit them to the letters available. But after a while, you can get into the flow and the game moves very quickly.&#10;&#10;"

The board is arranged with a single recess at the center surrounded by an alternating pattern of recesses and slots.&#10;&#10;There are several different ways to play:  a basic game, two levels of advanced play, a children's version, and a variety of optional rules.  All follow the same basic theme:  after the board is set up with chips in some or all of the recesses and slots, players take turns drawing a chip for the center recess and looking for patterns of chips (generally lines or triangles) containing runs of consecutive numbers.  When a player spots a pattern on his or her turn, he or she takes one of the non-central chips from the pattern and moves the chip from the center of the board into the vacated spot.  If the player cannot find a pattern, the center chip is instead taken off the board as a &quot;dead chip&quot; that can be played later in place of a random draw.  Single-ring chips are wild, and double-ring chips allow other chips to be stolen from opponents.  The game ends when the chip supply is exhausted and no more dead chips can be played -- at this point, players add up the values of the chips they collected and subtract any dead chips to determine to winner.&#10;&#10;In the more advanced variations of the rules, legal patterns and playable areas of the board change so that slots are used more and more, adding a stronger element of memory to the game.&#10;&#10;"

If he takes the pitch, the result can be either a ball or a strike, though the pitcher could also incur a passed ball, wild pitch, balk, or a hit batter.&#10;&#10;If the batter swings at the pitch, he spins the spinner to get a numerical result, and reads the result based upon the pitch thrown.

It is derived from the simpler game Truc, which is played in Valencia, Balearic Islands and parts of Italy. Each player is dealt three cards, which are played out in tricks, and points are also scored for holding combinations of cards in the same suit. It is the possible to bet extra points on who has the best combination or will win the tricks, and the bluffing, talking and joking that goes with this are an important part of the game. Truco is usually played by four players in partnerships, but it can also be played by two or six.&#10;&#10;(Taken from the website http://www.pagat.com/put/truc.html )&#10;&#10;"

It is played with a 32-card deck, the order of cards being J (low),Q ,K ,A ,7 ,8 ,9 ,10 (high). Each hand consists of four tricks, players must follow suit if able and the player who takes the last trick wins. Players accumulate points whenever they lose a hand, and are eliminated at seven points. Dice are commonly used to keep track of the score. The initial value of each hand is one point. It can be &quot;knocked&quot; (raised) by one point at any time by any player, except that no player may knock twice in a row. Players can either accept a raise or fold and take the lower number of points. Upon reaching six points a player is in &quot;poverty&quot; and subsequent hands are worth at least two points.&#10;&#10;"
