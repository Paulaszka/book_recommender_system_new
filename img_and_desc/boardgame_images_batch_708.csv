So you play the game at your own pace! &#10;In the Realtime mode, there are no turns and players can call out and resolve actions whenever they want to trigger them.&nbsp;&#226;&#128;&#139;Actions are powered by allocating dice to different spaces on the player&rsquo;s board and cards. Each character has its own set of skills and restrictions on dice placement. It is likely that you will quickly form a bond with your favourite.&nbsp;&#10;&#10;In the turn based mode, players break up the action into short stints, allocating dice in realtime and then grabbing a turn order marker. Players then resolve 2 actions each in an order based on who grabbed which turn order marker.&#10;&#10;Play a single round in five minutes and an entire tournament in one hour in realtime OR play a turn based game in 20 to 30 minutes. The choice is yours!&#10;&#10;With several different game modes including:&#10;&#10;     Every Eye for Themselves&#10;     Alliances&#10;     Nymphlet Ceremony&#10;     King of the Hill&#10;     Domination&#10;&#10;&#10;and 6 totally unique characters (with more on the way), Eye for an Eye has a huge amount of replayability.&#10;&#10;"

These phases are repeated until a player cannot draw a card, upon which the game ends immediately.

Poison bottles played in the trick taking phase are worth -3 points to that player at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;There are elements of hearts, nines, and memory in the game, with a focus on bluffing and heavy player interaction.&#10;&#10;"

It may have a very commanding view of the surroundings, or it may not. You won't know until you get up there!
