The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).&#10;&#10;The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't.

The game lasts 18 turns, after which the player with the most victory points (VPs) wins.

He discards a card to give himself a number of actions that turn, and he might receive additional actions from the samurai player. With these actions, the bandit can play different bandit troops &ndash; including infantry, archers and cavalry &ndash; with which he can then move around the village and attack the samurai, villagers and rice storage. The samurai player then chooses between five chips &ndash; combat, movement, leadership and two special action chips &ndash; to see how many actions that he has that turn. A samurai can perform three types of actions &ndash; attack, move, and use the villagers to attack bandits &ndash; but only one time for each samurai until one of the special chips has removed the counters of such action. The more actions that the samurai player performs, the more actions the bandit has.&#10;&#10;After a certain number of turns, the bandit player discards one of his action cards, then eliminates any samurai who is in the field of the discarded card.

In it two to five players must compete to build the most lucrative criminal empire while preventing their opponents from doing the same thing.&#10; Players are each dealt a hand of seven cards from which they play Wiseguy cards to form a Crew, and then in turn use their Wiseguy's &quot;stats&quot; (Honor, Greed, Power, and Influence) to play Front Company and Racket cards to build wealth. They may also use their &quot;stats&quot; to play War cards to attack opposing Crews, destroy opposing Crews' Empires, or steal their opponents' Rackets for themselves. Also, they may attack enemy Crews directly using Dice attacks, forcing wiser, wealthier Crews to defend themselves with strategic use of their own resources such as Wiseguy Modifiers and Retaliation cards. As the game progresses, Rat cards are added to the deck, a threat to every Crew on the table.&#10;&#10;The goal of Mafioso is to be the Crew with the most valuable Empire on the table at the end of the game, for only the crew with the most lucrative Empire will be chosen by Big Sal to remain a part of the Gouldini Crime Family, and the rest will be &quot;fed to the fishes&quot;.&#10;&#10;"
