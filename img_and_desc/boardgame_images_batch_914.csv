297121,,"Deadpan is game centered around holding your composure while abiding by hilarious rules that players draw from the deck. Players take tuns drawing one card from the deck. The object of the game is to not laugh when it is your turn to read a &quot;Statement&quot; card or read/answer a &quot;Response&quot; card all while trying to follow your own rules cards in your hand at all times.&#10;&#10;In the deck are &quot;Response&quot; cards that the drawer must ask another player of their choosing, in which that player must respond, and there are &quot;Statement&quot; cards which the drawer must simply read out loud. What makes Deadpan unique are the hilarious rules cards that are also in the deck. When a player draws a rule card, they must abide by the rule at all times, even when it is not their turn.&#10;&#10;The &quot;Response&quot; and &quot;Statement&quot; cards act as points. To score the &quot;Statement&quot; point, the drawer must successfully read the &quot;Statement&quot; card without laughing while following any rules in their hand. To score the &quot;Response&quot; card, the drawer must ask the question to another player of their choice while trying not to laugh and following their own rules. If the responding player is able to respond without laughing and follows their own rules, then they are awarded the point. If the responder fails, then the drawer who asked the question is awarded the point. If both fail, no one is awarded the point. If a player is caught not following their rules at any time, they lose one (if any) of their points.  First player to collect seven points is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are &quot;Mannerism&quot; - rules that implement a type of action a player must do as directed by the card, &quot;Starters...&quot;- implements that a player must start each sentence they speak with the statement on the card, &quot;...Enders&quot; - implements that a player must end each sentence they speak with the statement on the card, and &quot;New Name&quot; - implements that the player must refer to the directed player on the card by the name on the card anytime they address that player. There are also DEADPAN rules in the deck - These are the same categories as normal rules, but the difference being they are more over the top and the drawer gets to assign the DEADPAN rules to other players.&#10;&#10;In the deck are also &quot;Veto&quot; cards and &quot;Revenge&quot; cards. &quot;Veto&quot; enables a player to discard any regular rule from anyone's hand. &quot;Revenge&quot; cards give the player the opportunity for payback towards any player that has given them a DEADPAN rule.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The English Civil War is notable because of the large number of small actions that happened during the war. These provide a variety of interesting historical battles to fight. The player commands one to three 'brigades'. Brigades are usually 3 to 6 units, with 4 to 6 bases of figures per unit. For non historical battles brigades are generated randomly to provide interesting challenges and opportunities for the players.&#10;&#10;A base represents 60 to 100 infantry and half that for cavalry. The players decide how many figures to use per base and base size. Units lose bases of figures, not individual figures.&#10;&#10;The emphasis on the rules is on command and managing unit disruption caused by battlefield action. Quality of the commanders and units is usually more important than numbers or weapons. Raw units will need constant vigilance to keep them in the action while hardened Veterans will sort themselves out, dust themselves off and carry on. Commanders have different command rating and also can have individual qualities to reflect their character. A commander can thus be 'Steadfast' and good in defensive situations or a 'Drunkard' and a loose cannon. Units can receive disorder from movement, manoeuvre, combat, friendly units suffering reverses, etc. Disorder adversely effects a units abilities and after the limit is reached will lead to loses of bases. High quality units and good commander have a better ability to remove disorder.&#10;&#10;Infantry are rated in one of 7 categories, I1 to I7. The number indicates the number of muskets and pikes within the unit. I1 means the unit is an all musket unit, while an I7 unit is all pikes. Most units are of course in between these two extremes, two muskets to one pike is an I3 unit for example. All bases fire and melee so there is no need to exactly model the ratio of weapons. When firing you need to roll your I number or higher to hit, while if in melee you need you I number or lower to hit. In this way the mix of weapons within a unit is quickly reflected. For example: An I3 unit (2 muskets to 1 pike) needs to roll 3 or higher per base to hit when firing but an I5 unit (1 musket to 1 pike) must roll 5 or higher to hit. So when firing the I3 unit will have the advantage while in a melee the reverse is the case. In a close combat the I3 unit will need to roll 3 or less to hit, while the I5 unit will need 5 or less.&#10;&#10;There are four kinds of mainstream cavalry along with lancers and dragoons. The four kinds of cavalry allow the representation of the tactics of the period that is not possible in many other rules and is, like much of the rest of the rules, based on modern research of this fascinating period. 'Pistoleers' rely on firepower. 'Gallopers' rely on the reckless speed of their charge and the sword. While the dominant tactics of the war are the Dutch and Swedish styles of fighting. Entering combat at a high speed is an advantage but runs the risk of getting more disorder. Shooting the attackers can stop the aggressors in their tracks and leave them open to counter attack. Yet if it doesn't work.........&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to provide a set of rules that combine modern views of the war with an innovative and entertaining game. In the future the rules will be expanded to cover other wars and work on the Thirty Years War is well on the way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Some will flee but other may find you tasty! You will not be able to show your photos when you're eaten. Also remember that it's not the quantity of photos that count but quality. Big and dangerous dinosaurs are worth more points than small, easier to find ones.&#10;&#10;Let the Dino Safari begin!&#10;&#10;During setup players are required to create the &quot;island&quot; using tiles with hexagonal spaces starting with &quot;camp&quot; tile. Once it's done 12 randomly chosen dinosaur tokens are randomly placed on &quot;nest&quot; spaces facing down. Then each player choose their character and place him/her in the camp. Players take their turns clockwise. During player's turn you have three movement points and one &quot;take a picture&quot; action. You can spend those in any order you want. Characters can move in any direction they want, &quot;plains&quot; space costs 1 movement point while &quot;forest&quot; space costs 2. You cannot enter &quot;crags&quot; or &quot;lake&quot; spaces. To take a photo move to a space adjacent to dinosaur token and uncover it then take the card with species you've uncovered. On each species card you can see how much points it's worth and its skills like movement points and special rules. Players can also take pictures of already uncovered dinos to get their cards but you can score only once for each species. Starting with round two after you're done with your character's actions you can move 1 uncovered dinosaur token (you must be in possession of that species card). You can use that to run away from other players, scare off another uncovered dinosaur to remove its token so nobody can take a picture of it anymore or, if it's a carnivore, attack other players. Attacked player loses one life and is forced to return to camp. If a character is attacked third time (losing last remaining life) he/she is considered &quot;eaten&quot; and eliminated from game (his/her score is 0 no matter how many cards were in his/her possession). From now on during eliminated player's turn he/she can only move dinosaurs. Game ends when all 12 tokens are uncovered. The sum of points on cards in your possession is your score. Highest score wins. There is also a chance that all players are eaten. In that rare case game ends and nobody wins.&#10;&#10;"

Players are competing with each other to remove threats, find artifacts, complete tasks, and earn honor. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game becomes the new King of the reclaimed mountain.&#10;&#10;It is fundamentally a worker placement game, but with many rules that increase player interaction. Players compete to recruit four different worker types as they also compete to utilize locations before their opponents.&#10;&#10;The board is made up of 20 halls, semi-randomly placed at the start of the game. The top 8 halls were undefended, but the lower 12 halls have threats that must be cleared before they can be accessed.&#10;&#10;Each hall has one or two labors that can be performed in them. Each labor requires a particular type of dwarf, and often will require a team of dwarves plus other resources to be completed. Each labor offers its own rewards, from honor or gold, or mine cards, or artifacts, or retaining more dwarves to a players palace.&#10;&#10;A particular labor can only be used from one to four times a year, so players are competing to use use labors before each other. Because labors have different requirements to complete, they are also competing to gather the types of dwarves needed for the labors they want to perform.&#10;&#10;There are four kinds of dwarves: Workers, Warriors, Craftsmen, and Nobles. They are generally used for the kinds of labors one might expect from their names.&#10;&#10;Unlike most worker placement games, the players do not have their own pieces. There are common pools of dwarves available, and the players take or assign dwarves from those common pools. One pool is a hall called The Commons, which has dwarves ready to work in them. Players can use one dwarf from The Commons on each of their turns. Dwarves are also in The Camp outside of the mountain, recovering or resting until  players recruit them to their palaces.&#10;&#10;Play goes around the table, with players selecting a labor they want to perform in a hall, or a threat they want to remove. When a threat is removed, the hall it guarded is revealed and the player effectively gets a free turn to be the first to perform a labor in the hall.&#10;&#10;Players can obtain mine cards that will have either gold, iron, gems or mithril. Gold is turned in immediately, while the other three are kept secret until they are used to complete a labor or a task.&#10;&#10;There are also Tasks which the players can complete to earn victory points, which generally require four or five resources.&#10;&#10;Artifacts may be gained in several ways, and provide victory points as well as the opportunity to attract a dwarf from the Camp when it is revealed. They are a way to hide your possible activities from your opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five segments, each representing a year, though players can agree to shorter games by reducing the number of years played. A year ends when The Commons is empty of Dwarves and a player passes. That player will be the first player for the following year. Then the dwarves out in the halls return to The Commons to be available for the next year.&#10;&#10;Many of the threats have year-end effects that can remove dwarves from The Commons, remove them from the players' palaces, take gold or mine cards, re-close halls, or even remove a hall from the game.&#10;&#10;Players are also determining what kind of values the reclaimed kingdom will be known for. There are four Dwarven virtues - Military, Craft, Wealth, and Heritage. Players can promote these virtues by completing Tasks and performing Labors. The most promoted virtues can earn players bonus points at the end of the game for each Task they completed or Artifact they acquired associated with those virtues.&#10;&#10;The combination of randomly placed hidden halls and randomly placed threats with varying effects provides an enormous amount of replayability. Players need to consider the kinds of labors and threats that are present when devising their plans, as well as what dwarves are available in The Commons.&#10;&#10;It is a victory point gathering game. There are six ways to earn VP:&#10;Rewards for a Labor&#10;Completing a Task&#10;Acquiring Artifacts&#10;Clearing Threats&#10;Bonus points for clearing the most threats &#10;Bonus Points for matching Tasks and Artifacts to the most promoted Dwarven Virtues&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"
