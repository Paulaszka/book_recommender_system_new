Many years later, some brave outsiders rebuilt the village stone by stone, with the treasures amassed from their latest adventures. They then launched a clarion call to encourage all homeless adventurers to come live in this new ideal village.&#10;&#10;From all corners of the country, volunteers flocked to live in brand new houses, farms and shops. Some even camped on the village square, waiting for houses to become available. Thus, the school is once again filled with the laughter of children and the tavern is filled with playful echoes of conversations, punctuated by the clink of filled glasses. However, there remain claims that werewolves exist among the new community!&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Village! As in the original game of The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow, players assume characters in the charming village, with some players secretly being werewolves who tear apart one of the human citizens each night. However, in Village, players will also assume a trade/profession.&#10;&#10;Note that The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow: Village is both a standalone game and an expansion for the original game, although the card sizes in Village differ from those in the original game.&#10;&#10;"

Players have a monthly budget that includes insurance, expenses, income, savings, and stock speculation.&#10;&#10;Monthly income is determined by the job that each player receives at the beginning of the game and by investments that pay dividends or interest each month. Expenses are both fixed (for insurance, etc) and determined by random card draw. For example, a card may say, &quot;You have a child go to college, pay $50 a month for the next 16 months.&quot; Players are also allowed to take loans, which of course increases monthly expenses.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 24 months. The player with the highest Net Worth is the winner. Any player who's debts cannot be paid off is considered bankrupt and has lost.&#10;&#10;There does not appear to be a maximum to how many people can play the game.&#10;&#10;"

One player takes the role of the Doctor in all his regenerations, and his opponent assumes control of his arch enemy, The Master.&#10;&#10;At his disposal, the Doctor has a roster of companions from his past to help struggle against the renegade Timelord, featuring Rose Tyler, Romana, Adric, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, etc. His equipment includes, amongst others, his Sonic Screwdriver, K-9, jelly babies', and the Hand of Omega.&#10;&#10;The Master has a wide selection of villainous temporal marauders to choose from: Zygons, Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, Robots of Death, Omega, The Valeyard, Sutekh, and The Rani, etc. He even has the meddlesome option of starting an Interstellar War - much like he did between the Draconians and the Earth Empire in Space War. His deck also features such interesting devices as the Laser Screwdriver, Tissue Compression Eliminator, and a Raston Warrior Robot.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. The Twelve Doctors is played using a 3-column time-line system, representing the battle for Gallifrey, Earth present and future, and Earth past. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with companions EX-TER-MI-NATED! frequently, and marauders being dropped into black holes, or destroyed by the well-placed use of Venusian Aikido.&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, The Master has 3 planets that he can atomise during the course of each game: Telos, Metebelis III, and Skaro. This is in addition to the damage he may wreak upon Earth or Logopolis, etc, through cardplay. Destroying a planet has long-term consequences for the player, as well as short-term benefits. The Doctor, on the other hand, has the Journal of Impossible Things to use, but if he does so, makes the game easier for The Master to win.&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has three values: power, cost, and disrupt. Both player's decks are also a measure of the time they have remaining to thwart each other.&#10;&#10;The Twelve Doctors lineage can be traced back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever cannot draw a card has lost.&#10;     The Master wins if he disrupts more cards than the Doctor has left in his deck.&#10;     The Master wins if Gallifrey's power is reduced to zero.&#10;     The Master wins if Earth's power is reduced to zero (past and future).&#10;     The Master wins if all 11 incarnations of the Doctor are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Master wins if 5 tokens are placed upon the Wirrn.&#10;     The Doctor wins if all 6 incarnations of the Master are regenerated/destroyed.&#10;     The Doctor wins if 5 tokens are placed upon Lucy Saxon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Whoever gets 5 Key to Time cards in play first wins (expansion victory condition).&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The objective of the game is to defeat the enemy mafia, led by the opponent.&#10;&#10;In Kingpin, players choose between three different crime syndicates: the Italian Mafia, the Russian Mob, and the Yakuza. Each organization has different pieces, changing the style of each game. The Yakuza prefers quiet assassinations, the Russian Mob overcomes its opponents with sheer firepower, and the Mafia specializes in swift drive-by shootings. The game &quot;neo noir&quot; theme borrows heavily from cult gangster movies and graphic novels, such as the works of Quentin Tarantino or Frank Miller.&#10;&#10;Three important features of the game are: a two-sided game board featuring two different maps, three victory conditions available for the players, and the lack of randomness during play. The authors describe it as a fast-paced game of nerves, somewhere between a Mexican standoff and a game of chess where the rooks and bishops run around with Tommy-guns.&#10;&#10;Because of the suggestive theme, the publisher considered this title unsuitable for children.&#10;&#10;The game contains the following components:&#10;&#10;- double-sided board,&#10;- 24 gangster tiles,&#10;- 3 action tokens,&#10;- 12 fire tokens,&#10;- game rules.&#10;&#10;"

The Numberland (Zahlenland) concept has been developed continuously since the 1950&rsquo;s &ndash; notably by one of the designers,Dr. Gerhard Friedrich. The basic idea for this game is taken from the German bestseller &ldquo;Komm mit ins Zahlenland&rdquo; (&ldquo;Come with me to Numberland&rdquo;) by Friedrich de Galg&oacute;czy. The game can be used for as preparation for school and as a learning companion during the first school year. The following mathematical concepts and skills are addressed in gameplay:&#10;&#10;Cardinal number aspect (quantity aspect): Numbers are used to indicate the number or cardinality of the elements of a set (e.g. 6&#10;apples, 3 pine cones).&#10;&#10;Ordinal number aspect (order aspect): Numbers are used to indicate position in an ordered set (e.g. first, third etc.).&#10;&#10;Arithmetic aspect: Numbers indicate the result of an arithmetic operation, e.g. an addition (e.g. 5 = 3 + 2)&#10;&#10;Geometric number aspect: Numbers are used to identify geometric shapes (e.g. pentagon, triangle).&#10;&#10;Numeric image: Numbers are represented with the aid of numeral and dice images.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Numberland consists of 10 number houses, in each of which a number lives. Numberland has to be constructed correctly. But the number goblin, Jumble, is on his way from Mistake Forest to bring disorder to Numberland. Can the players stop him and build Numberland? Luckily they have the Number Fairy to help them. The players roll a die and if they roll a Numberland symbol they can construct on one of the buildings (which are completed in numerical order). If the players roll the Number Goblin their constrcutions will be mixed up and remain so until someone roll the Number Fairy, then the mix up can be corrected. Once all houses are finished we will see if Numberland is still jumbled or correct!&#10;&#10;"
