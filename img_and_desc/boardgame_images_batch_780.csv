Draft your team, challenge your friends, become a champion!&#10;&#10;ROBA is a fast-paced tactical game for two players. It can be taught in five minutes, but offers a challenge that will test the skills of even veteran gamers to their limit. ROBA pits a colorful and diverse cast of heroes against each other using a dynamic deck-drafting mechanic that offers rewarding depth and lasting replay value.&#10;&#10;ROBA was designed by Jack Murray, and tested by a team of over one-hundred playtesters from all around the world.&#10;&#10;Every game of ROBA begins with the draft, where you&rsquo;ll create your own deck by selecting heroes from a shared pool. You&rsquo;ll alternate drafting heroes with your opponent until you&rsquo;ve each assembled a team of three. Every hero brings an associated deck of ten cards &ndash; one of which will be that hero&rsquo;s powerful Ultimate ability. Shuffling your heroes&rsquo; three decks together will create a play deck of thirty cards, and this &ndash; along with the three heroes themselves &ndash;is what you&rsquo;ll use to play the game.&#10;&#10;Every hero brings unique strengths to a team, and different heroes support different strategies, opening up unique paths to victory. There are many possible combinations to explore, but be wary of falling into predictable patterns! Each player also gets to ban heroes during the draft, removing them from the pool of available picks entirely. If your opponent&rsquo;s strategy is transparent, you can punish them with a crafty pick. But beware! They can do the same to you.&#10;&#10;ROBA pitches you against another player in a contest of nerve, wits, and skill. The aim of the game is to defeat the opponent&rsquo;s deity, a powerful divine force that begins the game out of play, and must be forced to manifest before it can be destroyed.&#10;&#10;To achieve this, you pit your team of three heroes against your opponent&rsquo;s, each of you wielding your heroes&rsquo; unique skills and abilities. The player who does this best &ndash; utilizing their heroes to the fullest, while exploiting the weaknesses of their enemies &ndash; will emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;The battle takes place across three lanes, each of which holds two divine conduits &ndash; one belonging to each player. When all three of your opponent&rsquo;s conduits are destroyed, their deity will appear &ndash; bringing its divine might to bear upon the conflict. When a deity falls, the game ends &ndash; with victory going to the player who defeated it.&#10;&#10;"

Every player is on their own and does not care about the fate of the others...&#10;&#10;The idea is based on a real situation in the 1970s when high class Stasi Agent Werner Stiller fled from East Germany towards FRG. When he left GDR, he took many classified documents with him that compromised hundreds of Stasi Agents deployed in West Germany. They immediately had to flee to avoid being captured. However the game does not adopt this scenery 100%, so players will not play Stasi Agents.&#10;&#10;At its core, The Red Claw is a damage avoidance game. Cards are put on the table in four rows of different colors. At their end are two tokens, usually with tracking (damage) points, and on the other end are the counteragents...&#10;&#10;In turn order, players play one of the cards in their hands. It contains two symbols. The Counter Agent of each corresponding row moves one card tile per symbol. All cards it touches go into the active player's hand. If a row is empty, the tokens at its end are scored. Whoever possesses more cards of the corresponding color &quot;wins&quot; the token and gets it. (Actually players usually want to avoid winning these tokens.) In case of a tie, the player with cards with the higher number gets it. This player then puts its cards of the corresponding color on the discard pile. Now the same procedure is done again for the second token.&#10;&#10;The discard pile of this color is shuffled and players buld a a new row from it and reveal new tokens.&#10;&#10;The game ends if one player has a certain number of tracking points. Points get counted, and whoever has the least wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts with a hand of 5 cards.&#10;&#10;The calendar token is used to keep track of turn order within a round. It is assigned randomly at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;Each Round is divided into 8 Phases: &#10;1.   Calendar Phase - the player with the calendar token passes it to the player to his right. &#10;2.   Population Phase - the population level increases by 1 (it starts at level 2).  &#10;3.   Draw Phase - each player is dealt 2 cards from the deck. &#10;4.   Trade Phase - staring with the player with the calendar token, each player may play one trade card from his hand. Trade cards allow players to draw extra cards, look at opponent&rsquo;s hands, cause opponents to lose scoring points etc.&#10;5.   Bid Phase - all players must bid zero to two bid cards from their hands. Bidding is simultaneous with players revealing their bid cards at the same time. The player with the highest value bid wins the bid and becomes the Priest King. &#10;6.   Farm Phase - the Priest King must discard 1 or 2 Bid cards with a combined value equalling or exceeding the current population level. If unable to do so, the game ends immediately and the current Priest King loses 13 scoring points. &#10;7.   Build Phase - The Priest King may play up to 2 bid cards as build cards.  A card of value 1 is placed by itself face-up in the middle of the table and is considered the first stage of a new temple. Higher level bid cards can be added onto already existing temples.

Even though the game has the same number of pieces that there is in Chess (32), there is a slightly greater variety of them in BrazChess (8 against 6 in Chess). Some of the &quot;parachuting&quot; that occurs in Shogi is present (regarding the movement of Grand Dukes - a promoted Pawn); you'll also find different forms of capturing (suicidal attacks and the Grand Duke's Zone of Control). Also present is the concept of passing your turn.&#10;&#10;What you need to play it:&#10;In order to play BrazChess, you will need:&#10;A) The rules (see Files);&#10;B) A Modern Chess board (8x8) and Pieces (you'll need to either paint the heads or bases of two Pawns from each side, or use some other Pieces to represent the 2 Lords from each side).

B. Pritchard. While it is true that there are several Chess-like games like this in the World, Chess is, itself, a variant of an older game, that was already a variant of an even older game.

Celebrated by many as one of the finest and often sought-after game titles ever produced by Game Designers&rsquo; Workshop (GDW, 1979) on a fascinating, almost forgotten conflict that would determine the course of European history for the next twenty years or more.&#10;&#10;To the West, the First World War was &ldquo;the war to end all wars&rdquo;. To the submerged nationalities of Eastern Europe, this war removed the obstacles to their political aspirations&ndash; Tsarist Russia collapsed in 1917; Germany and Austria-Hungary were defeated in 1918. The disintegration of these empires sparked a chaotic period of struggles in Eastern Europe, as proponents of the old order, nationalists, and revolutionary socialists fought for supremacy. The conflict between the Poles and the Bolsheviks was the most important campaign in determining the borders of Eastern Europe.&#10;&#10;Red Star/White Eagle is an operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the 1920 conflict over the border areas of Eastern Europe. Game play is not for the faint of heart with open maneuvering creating a fast and fluid situation as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. Nearly any defensive line can be bypassed in the wide-open expanse of West Russia, forcing players to probe for vulnerabilities and seize the initiative. An exhaustive Order of Battle helps capture the key historically facets of the campaign including supply, cavalry charges, armored trains, loss of command, inter-front cooperation, rail nets, railroad reserve, flotillas and marines, border garrisons, numerous specialized units, and more.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the GDW 1979 release that honors the original game design. All aspects of the game are being enhanced, based on years of player experience and feedback. One example is adding initial set-up and reinforcement entry codes to all units to ease set-up and play. Play time can vary with three scenarios provided and the Campaign Game. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, the Campaign game is credited as allowing for up to three players (with two playing the Russian side).

Its fussy clients love to order pizza by slices. By playing this game you'll become such an expert in fractions that you'll be second to none.&#10;&#10;The game set is designed in a charming Italian style. It includes both rectangular cards with orders and fascinating round cards. The latter are trays with different numbers of pizza slices. Apart from cheese and olives, pizzas include tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppers in various combinations; each one can have two additional ingredients.&#10;&#10;Splittissimo offers the fastest delivery!&#10;&#10;There are several versions of the game.&#10;&#10;Let&rsquo;s start with the easiest one. If you&rsquo;re playing with children of five and older, use only round cards. Beginner level cards are marked with one dot (to make it more challenging, you can add cards with two or three dots later). Each player takes three cards and puts them face-up in front of him; the same number of cards is placed face-up on the table (playing by the rules of a more challenging version, the players draw 4 cards and 4 cards are placed on the table) The task is to use several playing field cards to assemble a pizza , so that the number of its slices would be equal to the number of slices in one of your pizzas. Or, conversely, you can choose one of the playing field pizzas and assemble it using several of your own cards.&#10;&#10;Playing with older kids, add the rectangular order cards. The task is to assemble the ordered pizzas using the cards on the playing field, taking into account both their size and the ingredients. To add excitement to the game, use a number of special cards, which allow you to slow down your opponents&rsquo; work and accelerate your own pace using &ldquo;last minute&rdquo; orders.&#10;&#10;All versions of the game end with counting the whole pizzas that players managed to put together. In other words, the players should make whole pizzas from the slices they have, which helps them to reinforce addition of fractions once again.&#10;&#10;"
