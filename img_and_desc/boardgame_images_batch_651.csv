Booking this gig wins the game.&#10; Player take turns. Each turn has four phases. The first is an income phase, where players earn credits and/or money (except when in NYC, where they have to pay to live there). The second phase is an audition phase where they roll dice to see if they are cast in a gig. The third phase is a movement phase. The last phase the players either can play a 'bitter card' or they 'take class'. Playing a bitter card generally has a detrimental effect on another player. Taking class involves exchanging money and other resources to gain special advanced credits.&#10;&#10;Bitter cards are generally earned by failing to book auditions. Closing cards are earned by completing professional gigs. Specialty Credits are required to audition for more advanced gigs, such as Cruise Line and Bus 'N Truck. A player must possess all three specialty credits (acting, vocal, and dance) and must have 15 total credits or more to audition for their 'Big Break'. If a player fails this audition, he/she loses an advanced credit, a generic credit, and gains two bitter cards. Play continues until somebody books their 'Big Break'.&#10;&#10;A future expansion of My Big Break is planned which will contain the option to work for a Theme Park and a Dinner Theatre. Players will also be able to wait tables in NYC and take an agent there.&#10;&#10;"

(In a game with two or three players, set up two or one additional racks visible to all players.)&#10;&#10;On a round, the active player rolls the three color dice, e.g., blue, red, and yellow. Each player tries to guess what the sum of the numbers on their rack is for the cards that correspond to the die colors. If the dice showed two green and one grey, for example, you'd add the green number twice and the grey number once &mdash; but of course you can't see what your numbers are; you can only see what they aren't based on what's showing in the racks visible to you.&#10;&#10;The active player then takes one of the bid strips &mdash; seven cardboard strips that come in different lengths &mdash; and places it across one or more numbers on the number line in front of them to show the range in which their sum lies, e.g., 13-16. Each other player does the same, choosing from the strips not previously chosen. If you guess correctly, you score points, with shorter strips being worth more points; if you're wrong, then you must discard any one of your colored cards face up, then draw a new card of this color and place it in your rack unseen. You now see this hidden number, which may help you deduce sums from previous rounds, but now you have to start over with you deductions for that color! Other players see the new card you just placed, so they get more info, too.&#10;&#10;After 8-10 rounds, depending on the number of players, each player guesses the numbers on their racks, writing down one, two, or three guesses for each color. If you guess correctly, you score 5, 2, or 1 points for a color based on how many guesses you wrote. Add these points to whatever you scored previously, and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how he/she thinks this location relates to the starting one.

When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game.

For such transgression, a fiery death should be the only appropriate response &mdash; but Drakon has decided to toy with you before she devours you. You and your rival heroes will each be released into the labyrinth, and the first hero to discover ten gold pieces will go free with his treasure. The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.&#10;&#10;In every game of Drakon, you and your opponents must fight to stay alive in the midst of the labyrinth. On your turn, you can either move your hero to another room, or add another piece to the labyrinth, placing beneficial chambers in your own path and throwing your opponents into harm's way. But you must be cautious. The chambers of Drakon's labyrinth are filled with danger and ancient magics, not to mention the dragon herself. To navigate these deadly corridors and survive, you&rsquo;ll need to be quick and careful.&#10;&#10;On every turn, you have a crucial choice to make. You can either move forward into a new chamber, or you can expand the labyrinth by playing a new chamber tile from your hand. The new chambers that you play feature unique circumstances and magical objects that you may encounter on your adventures through Drakon's lair.&#10;&#10;The majority of these chambers offer powerful effects to any hero that enters the chamber. You may gain the power to destroy any chamber in the labyrinth, or call a windstorm to carry you along, increasing your movement. You may even take command of a floating chamber and fly it to the other side of the labyrinth. Other chambers force more harmful effects on those heroes unlucky enough to enter. A room may cause you to lose a coin as you avoid the dangers within, and any hero who hears the siren song of the magical harp is forced to move into its chamber. As you and your fellow heroes play these chambers from your hand, they form a cunning maze, and only the wise can find their way out.&#10;&#10;Despite the power of these chambers, the central goal of your quest is to find gold: only by being the first player to claim ten gold can you escape the dungeon. Plenty of chambers allow you to find a coin or steal a coin from an opponent, but the gold value of coins can vary dramatically. Your most recently stolen coin may have a value of three gold or just one. Because coins are kept face-down, hiding their value, you'll never know exactly how close your opponents are to victory.&#10;&#10;Six heroes are trapped within Drakon's sadistic labyrinth, and each hero has his own unique abilities to help him survive. Each ability can only be used once per game though, making the timing of the ability incredibly important. You may play as the sorceress and escape from a most dire situation by passing through a wall. You may play as the thief and collect the gold you need at the most opportune moment by preying on another hero. You may even play as the ranger and use a burst of speed to race across the maze when necessary. No matter which hero you play in a game of Drakon, you'll need to take full advantage of your unique ability at the opportune moment if you want to grab the gold and escape from Drakon's clutches.&#10;&#10;Of course, the heroes are not alone in the labyrinth. The legendary dragon also stalks the halls and chambers of the maze, taunting any hero unlucky enough to encounter her. Certain chambers throughout the labyrinth allow you to move Drakon through the dungeon. If you can move Drakon into the same chamber as a hapless hero, that hero is immediately sent back to the entrance chamber and loses three coins, as Drakon toys with him before releasing him once more into the maze.&#10;&#10;You and your rival heroes are trapped. Your greatest threat may be Drakon or the other heroes. In this dark labyrinth, only one thing can save you: your own greed. Will you ruthlessly grab gold and undermine your opponent&rsquo;s schemes before escaping to victory? Or will you fail and become just another meal for the dragon? You decide your fate, but only one hero can escape from Drakon!&#10;&#10;"

Each god will place ten, and score points based on number of edges connected and terrain features completed.&#10;&#10;Population - Each god has 40 tribes to competitively place on the board, usually 3-5 at a time. The finger of god touches an origin square, and life spreads from it. Terrain features limit how many tribes can fit in an area. Points are scored based on how terrain is filled. This phase feels a little like Go.&#10;&#10;Construction - With the world populated, the gods migrate tribes together. When enough are in a square, they build a temple to whichever god has a majority in their stack, and leave the board. Rival tribes are captured and converted by this process.  Points are scored by using tribes to build temples, and by converting rivals' tribes. This feels vaguely like the city building mechanic from Civilization (original).&#10;&#10;War! - The world is now full of temples. The gods each have a monster and a hero to summon from their temples on their turn. Monsters seek to defile rival temples, making them more difficult to summon from. Heroes go to fight rival heroes and monsters, or just vandalize a rival temple. Points are scored for slaying, defiling and robbing. This phase can feel like the endgame of Chess.&#10;&#10;Each phase has a method of earning bonus points. At the end of the last phase, the gods total their scores to determine a winner.&#10;&#10;"

Puru puru kabe don translates to &quot;Trembling wall-slap&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a standee card with the picture of a girl, and four double-folded cards with the picture of a boy, holding his hand on the edge of the cards.&#10;&#10;Each player gets 1 folded boy card and one try each. The goal of the game is to tip the folded boy card so that it leans on the girl standee card, without the latter tipping. If the player succeeds, he gains 1 point. If the girl card tips, or the boy card doesn't lean on the girl card, the player scores &ndash;1 points. If he refuses to try, he scores nothing. Play as many rounds as there are players, switching start player, and the player with the most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;"

The game uses simple mechanics with a highly interactive turn sequence that keeps gamers engaged for a fast, fun, and furious 2 to 2.5 hours of play.  The game units are blocks with labels and a low unit density on board means the game does not bog down. The core rules are 4 pages expanded to 8 with detailed graphics and explanations meaning you can be up and playing with 15 minutes of rules reading and a short set up.&#10;&#10;Korea is called America&rsquo;s &ldquo;forgotten war&rdquo;. There are very few games on the topic, and none quite like this. The US Army, US Marine Corp, ROK Army, NKPA, and CPA forces are all represented. Air power, armor, and the Naval might of the UN forces are represented simply and elegantly. Rail movement, amphibious landings, and surprise attacks are in here too. Can you as the NKPA take Seoul and Pusan before the might of the US led UN forces get too strong? Will you as the UN player be able to blitz into N. Korea securing the Yalu River before Chinese forces come pouring across like a blizzard from the north? And as a last resort can you secure more enemy territory to control across the 38th Parallel as the peace makers negotiate the end of the war? The decisions are yours!&#10;&#10;"

The scenarios use a common rule set combined with scenario-specific rules. Regular units are mostly divisions, brigades and regiments, while irregular units include warrior levies and tribal bands. Armor, transports, air power, and headquarters (which represent corps-level artillery assets, engineers, and administrative and command centers) are also represented. Lion of Judah has one large-hex map and approximately 400 counters representing Italian, Ethiopian, Commonwealth, French and German units.  In addition to the military units, there are markers to track game and unit status, as well as several Random Event markers used in the historical scenarios for added historical flavor.&#10;&#10;Colonial Warfare in Unforgiving Conditions.&#10;The campaigns for Ethiopia were fought in extremely inhospitable terrain. Logistics was one of the key issues of these battles. This is simulated in Lion of Judah by supply counters: everything a modern army requires to operate, from replacements to ammunition to artillery, has to be moved across the harsh terrain. Western units have far more firepower that the Ethiopians, but much lower movement rates. This simulates the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; rate of movement for western units when moving across difficult terrain. They had to move through jungles, mountains and marshes, relying on local guides to move through this mostly-unmapped terrain.  Supplies often had to go by air due to lack of a road network. Western forces may attempt to move at a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; movement rate (using the &ldquo;Forced march&rdquo; table), but this entails risks: units may get lost, run out of supply, lose their pack mules, or even be ambushed. Unlike the Italians, the Ethiopian army of 1935 was a medieval-style collection of warriors, with little or no central command. This is simulated through activation rules: Ethiopian forces are activated randomly, and some may end up not activating at all during an entire turn! The Italian player may also &ldquo;bribe&rdquo; certain Ethiopian formations into inactivity, as they did historically.&#10;&#10;Conventional and Guerrilla Warfare.&#10;Both historical campaigns, have conventional and unconventional warfare. In 1935-36, the Ethiopian army engaged a conventional Italian army in the north and south, while at the same time fighting rebels and tribal guerrillas in the far off corners of the Empire. In 1940-41, it was the Italian Army who had to face both a conventional, professional enemy (the Commonwealth forces) and Ethiopian guerrillas and Commonwealth special forces operating in its rear.&#10;To win, players must successfully manage both kinds of warfare, guerrilla and conventional. When invading Ethiopia in 1935-36, the Italian player must invest resources to encourage trouble within the Ethiopian Empire, recruiting irregulars, bribing and encouraging rebellions. If the Italian player concentrates exclusively on the conventional military front, then the Ethiopian Empire will have a chance to concentrate its armies and achieve a resounding, glorious Adowa-like victory over the Italian invaders.&#10;&#10;Similarly, in the 1940-41 campaign the Commonwealth/Ethiopian player must raise rebel forces to force the Italian player to use desperately needed units to defend their lines of communications and cities. Furthermore, the Italian player has an 'Italian Prestige Index', which determines the chance of internal revolts.  He must attack British held territories and outposts as much as possible to keep his Prestige high, especially early in the game before the full might of the Commonwealth army can be brought to bear. The uncertainty regarding Italian defeats in Libya  (handled via event chits) adds further randomness as it is not guaranteed that the British and Indian units that were historically available in January 1941 will arrive in time for the Allied counteroffensive in Ethiopia.&#10;&#10;Diplomacy and other Chrome&#10;A random events system similar to that used in The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 accounts for political and diplomatic events, rebellions in the rear, the arrival of combat units, the purchase of foreign weapons (in the 1935-1936 Scenario) or the arrival of blockade runners to Italian East Africa. Pressure exerted by various political actors is also simulated through events chits: for instance, the event &ldquo;Pressure by Mussolini&rdquo; (1935-36 Scenario), simulates pressure from il Duce when he demanded a rapid advance on to Addis Ababa before he lost the favorable international situation. The Italian player may use chemical weapons, but at the risk of losing Italian Victory Points if the &ldquo;League of Nations&rdquo; event is pulled that turn.&#10;&#10;Special units and rules cover the above mentioned Italian chemical warfare, as well as road building, supply dumps, Italian fuel and ammo shortages (1940-1941 scenario), open cities, the Red Sea Flotilla and blockade runners. The countersheet includes exotic units, such as the Somali Camel Corps, the Italo-German motorized company (a German volunteer unit that was recruited among German refugees from Kenya and crews of interned German ships), and Mission 101 or Gideon Force (Orde Wingate&rsquo;s guerrilla force operating in the Italian rear).&#10;&#10;"

Two players face off against each other in sparkling combat in order to defeat the other and capture their gems so that their rival cannot transform. Decks span from a number of themes including Nightmares, Daydreams, Sweets, Flowers, the Constellations, and even in the Internet. Playtime is under 20 minutes, which is more than enough time to show your rivals what true (sparkling) pain is.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is score three of your rival's gems. Gems are gained when a RIval's Magical Girl's HP reaches zero. To do this, players using a series of spells and abilities (and sometimes a little roleplaying) must engage in battle. As battle is happening, Magical Girls have a limited supply of magic they are able to use. If their magic is drained to zero before their hit points are, they are safe from being defeated. Some Magical Girls will be able to become Grand Magical Girls, which are very powerful for only a short amount of time. The game ends to be short but action packed.&#10;&#10;"
