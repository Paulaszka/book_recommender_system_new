The battle lasted from August 1942 until early February 1943.  The opponents on Guadalcanal were approximately of equal strength and with control of the seas around the island still to be decided, Guadalcanal was the last time in the war when an American amphibious operation faced the prospect of total defeat.&#10;&#10;"

Some of your Power Pieces can be used to destroy, while others can distract and act as decoys. The Starburst, Blaster, Ringer, Decoy and Laser each have special ways of fending off the enemy (see below). As commander of the Stealth Force, you must remember the importance of your mission - defend, retaliate and move with all possible speed. The future of Dimension Gemstone is in your hands.&#10;&#10;Under Fire - The longer you wait to retaliate, the more time your opponent has to build strategy and plan the next attack. Keep focused as there are concealed dangers that may catch you unaware.&#10;&#10;Escape - Dimension Gemstone has Portals that are the way for you and your Stealth Force to find a route of escape, or as a means of Surprise attack. They can zip you from one side of Dimension Gemstone to another, swiftly out of danger's way.&#10;&#10;Your Mission is Clear - and it is of the utmost importance that you keep in mind the dynamics of each Stealth Attack Module.

You can pick up a piece of garlic to protect yourself if you land on a garlic square. If you reach the castle, you can pick up a princess and start moving her back to the village. If the vampire lands on you and you do not have garlic, your piece is returned to the village. If you do not have garlic, the vampire bites you.

The frogs may be stacked but an opponent whose frog rests on top of the stack can freeze a stack of two. An opponent can not freeze a stack of three. The stacking limit is five (except for the root and pond, which have none). The object of the game is to maneuver all twelve of your frogs into the pond before one's opponent.&#10;&#10;"

Hass was a scuba-diving pioneer, and with his beautiful wife Lotte was well-known in the 1950s for his underwater photography and film-making.&#10;&#10;Each player is a diver competing to bring to the surface the greatest number and value of sea creatures (and some treasure!).  The deeper the dive, the greater the rewards, but also the greater the risk of losing the catch from unwelcome events or robbery by another player.  Returning to their ship makes the diver's catch safe, but takes time, and the next dive may be limited to shallower waters where there is less to find.&#10;&#10;The catch is represented by cards of differing values, with bonuses if sets are collected, including some dangerous creatures scoring negative points.  Most show an interesting underwater photo.  There are also Action (event) cards and Diving Equipment cards, that determine how deep each dive can go.&#10;&#10;The board has a disc underneath, and when this is rotated different colors show through holes punched in the top board.  Each turn the player takes the action determined by the color at the current location of their diver pawn - take a number of value cards, an event card or a &quot;dangerous&quot; card - and then hopes to move somewhere else to collect more value cards.  The disc is rotated each time cards are taken, and the holes are far enough apart that the change of color is unpredictable.  There is a die, but its main use is to determine the outcome of robberies.&#10;&#10;"

The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.&#10;&#10;As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.&#10;&#10;To play this game there is an amount of equipment to be assembled.&#10;1. Ships to 1/600th scale.&#10;2. Enough 15mm scale figures and guns to represent the gun deck of the ship.&#10;3. A piece of card or model to 13mm scale upon which to put the figures, thus showing the exact position.&#10;4. Hexagons inscribed in 5.5&rdquo; circles for movement purposes. (2 for each ship)&#10;6. Some ordinary 1-6 sided dice.&#10;7. Some scenery for sandbars and shore batteries.&#10;8. Paper to note down damage.&#10;9. A blue cloth or similar.&#10;10.

But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.&#10;&#10;In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.&#10;&#10;In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.&#10;&#10;The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)&#10;&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters&#10;&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  &#10;MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   &#10;UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies&#10;&#10;DESIGNERS Vance von Borries&#10;DEVELOPER Tony Curtis&#10;MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.&#10;&#10;Scenarios: &#10;1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.&#10;&#10;2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.&#10;&#10;3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?&#10;&#10;4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.&#10;&#10;"
