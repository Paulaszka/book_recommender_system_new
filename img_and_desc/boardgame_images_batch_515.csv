The deck is placed on the table, one card is drawn and placed next to it, this will be the beginning of the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;. Players then take turns.&#10;&#10;A players turn consist of:&#10;&bull; Draw three cards from the deck,&#10;&bull; If possible form a word using the cards from your hand and placing it before you,&#10;&bull; Place one of his remaining cards to the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Each player during his turn adds one card to the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;, this way the &ldquo;tape&rdquo; becomes longer. If a player needs a certain letter to form a word but doesn&rsquo;t have them he can take them from the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;, he also takes the remaining letters following the one he took.&#10;&#10;The &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; card &mdash; a free card. Can replace any letter in played word. You can take the &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; card used by another player by replacing it with the letter it was used as. &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; cannot be placed on the &ldquo;tape&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Prize cards can be played together with a word if the word fits the cards criteria (for example, is a piece of clothing, none of the letters repeat). The prize card increases the points for that word and can give a player some extra possibilities.&#10;&#10;When a player &ldquo;leaves&rdquo; (has no cards left to play at the end of his turn or only has prize cards), the round ends and points are counted. Points for a players word are calculated based on the letter cost of that word (each letter is worth a certain amount of points) and prize card used. The cost of letters that remain on the players hands is deducted from his point total. It is possible to get a negative result due to this.&#10;&#10;Points earned during a round sum up with points gained on previous rounds. The game is played until one player earns the necessary amount of points to win (the amount of points should be decided before starting the game). The first one to earn them is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game contains: &#10;&bull; 102 letter-cards; &#10;&bull; 14 prize cards;&#10;&bull; 4 &ldquo;Underwood&rdquo; cards; &#10;&bull; Game rules.&#10;&#10;More about cards&#10;A letter card, apart from the letter also has its cost shown (how points a player gains from using it in his word) and the number of cards in the deck with this letter.&#10;&#10;A prize card has: an icon, conditions to play this card and the prize that it gives. The icon shows what the card requirements are. There is also a more detailed explanation on what needs to be done.&#10;&#10;"

Find hidden bombs and dismantle them, help hostages into safety, or take out terrorist leaders. Due to the high variation in goals, targets, threats and specific circumstances, players need to choose their set-up and strategy each time they start a mission or a campaign. Don't just throw in grenades with your buster at public places such as airports and train stations, or else civilians might get hurt, resulting in negative points on your mission balance. (Plus, you know, injuring civilians is not cool.) Develop your primary skill, but don't neglect your attack power, defense power and other skills if you want to stay alive in this thrilling new game.&#10;&#10;Countdown: Special Ops is fully modular, with players being able to create their own game by adjusting four different aspects of play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Game situations: With more than 200 playing cards, the challenges and threats are different each time you play.&#10;     Game mode: You can play a single mission, a campaign or a scenario; each game mode has its own level and duration, and you're advised to start with a single mission on the lowest level (green).&#10;     Level up: Did you succeed a few times on level green? If so, you might want to try the next (orange) level or even a scenario, that is, three missions in a row with increasing difficulty!&#10;     Goals: Even players' goals can be altered. Countdown: Special Ops is a co-operative game, but if you'd like to change the rules, you could add one or two traitors to the team and play &quot;Traitor Mode&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;Development&#10;You can develop your own Special Op by improving his or her skills. This is done in scenario or campaign play. This brings out interesting aspects of the game in which you have to choose how many risk you want to take to gain extra experience or if you want to move slow and stay alive at all cost...&#10;&#10;This variation, combined with the 30-minute time limit per mission, makes the experience of a mission &quot;feel&quot; like an actual PC game in many aspects. Smart development is essential to survive the missions on higher threat levels.&#10;&#10;"
