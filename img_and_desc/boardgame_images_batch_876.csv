As the hordes multiplied, conflict became commonplace, splintering the population into rival citadels. Eventually, war, greed, and the depletion of resources pushed Fantos to the brink of destruction, and in response to the planet's cry for help, Zodraz, the Cosmic Warden, intervened, sentencing the planet to a great cull to be survived by only a single worthy citadel.&#10;&#10;Fate of Fantos: The Iridium Wars is a tableau-building card game with competitive and co-operative elements for 3-6 players, each assuming the role of a unique citadel of Fantos. Each are responsible for hiring acolytes to manage their affairs, with the ultimate goal of obtaining the most Iridium, and therefore the most favorable position when Zodraz finally arrives.&#10;&#10;Citadels must manage their Iridium harvesting strategically, however, as it further contributes to the pollution of Fantos, revealing new trials along the way. Zodraz also unleashes plagues, summons cosmic creatures, and forces dissent between the citadels as the game progresses. Citadels must choose whether to resolve them together as a planet, or watch as rival citadels struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;"

But beware, because a failed attack could even lead to a terrible counter from one of the many japan folklore-based members of the Shogun Horde. Not only that, but also during each and every attack the energy of the kami could give even more power if you are lucky enough to get the right combination from the yin-yang symbol dices. Finally, the dice-based skill system will also allow for powerful moves during your turn, giving passive or active effect to choose from. But beware, cause the more powerful a skill is, the harder it will be to use it again, adding a tactical layer to the game. &#10;Besides all the mechanics, we think that a good story is a crucial part of immersion and fun, and for that we are honored to have one of the top fantasy Spanish writers, David Velasco, in our team.

During the trick-taking, players follow normal trick-taking rules (follow the lead if possible, play a trump otherwise).&#10;&#10;The winner of the round then leads a blind bidding, placing costumed cards face-down plus chips. Players that don't want to or cannot play a costumed mascot play a visitor instead, face-up as a discard.

Several different clans call Neemus home, including Wolf Clan, Hedgehog Clan, Rabbit Clan, and the Owl Clan. While the many clans have called this land home for as long as they can remember, they know they were not the first to live here. On the edge of Neemus lies a place the clans call Iron Forest, filled with strange looking structures and creations. Upon deeper exploration, the combined forces of Animal Clans discovered incredible technology that they quickly learned how to use, creating their own amazing machines that helped them develop their own civilization. However, one day, Iron Forest sprang to life and rose into the sky, building machines of their own. This Iron Force has one objective: to take back the technology stolen from Iron Forest. Now Animal Clans must fight back to protect their homeland.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Iron Forest is a flicking game for 2-4 players, split into two opposing teams: Animal Clans or Iron Force. Each scenario offers asymmetrical objectives that each side needs to fulfil in order to win. Scenarios involve players trying to control certain areas of the game board, destroy opposing team mechas, collect certain objects, and much more. On their turns, players draw cards from their team's activation deck, then activate the mecha depicted on that card by either flicking it or launching it. Players also have access to a range of different power-up cards that will grant their side unique abilities, turning the tide in their favour!&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

In Fossilis, 2 to 5 players become paleontologists working the dig site with shovels, whisk brooms, and chisels looking for a find that could make their career.&#10;&#10;Each round, players get two actions to dig at the site or make an extraction. As they remove the top layers of sand, clay, and stone, they'll discover trace fossils, which can be exchanged for tools, the plaster necessary to extract bones, and discovery points. As they delve deeper, precious bones will be exposed. They can make a careful extraction if they have the right amount of plaster, but sometimes shifting the earth to cover up a find and slow down the competition is the right move. Bones on their own can be valuable, but museums are really interested in more complete specimens. Sets of bones can be exchanged for museum cards worth big points!&#10;&#10;Fossilis features a unique 3D dig site board, with recessed pockets filled with dinosaur bones, and thick, chunky terrain tiles that cover the dig site. Players have to use strategy, timing, and a little bit of luck if they want to make the best discoveries, get their name in all the paleontology journals, and of course, win the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Note: The Kickstarter edition supports solo play and includes other game related content.
