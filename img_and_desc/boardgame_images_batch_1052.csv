The Constellars are often tasked with the conveyance of armies across realms during wars and this ability is crucial to their role.&#10;&#10;Setting up and preparing for the ritual is the easy part, the real challenge comes in maintaining a delicate balance of the cosmic forces as one disrupts the fabric of space and time so that others may arrive at their intended destination safely.&#10;&#10;TKG ARENA: A Rift of Portals is a game for 1 player.&#10;&#10;Components required for this game:&#10;&#10;WORLD TILES:    48&#10;OINKS:    15 from each element for each player (Default)&#10;&#10;Winning Conditions&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to stabilize the portal once it is set up and this is represented by fulfilling a number of conditions.&#10;&#10;1.    The number of Oinks in the Inner Gate must be equal or more than the Oinks placed in the Outer Void.&#10;2.    The number of elemental insignias placed on any linear sides of the Boundary must be equal.&#10;3.    The elemental insignias on each tile must be matched by a placed Oink representing the same element.&#10;&#10;Ending Condition&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles are played and all unmatched Oinks on any tile on the Boundary are moved to the Outer Void. The player loses when the winning conditions are not achieved when the game ends.&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;&#10;A player starts the game by drawing randomly from a stack of world tiles to be placed in a 3 x 3 grid manner as below.&#10;&#10;X        A    B    C        O&#10;        D    I    E        &#10;        F    G    H&#10;&#10;1.    Shuffle the 48 world tiles into a stack. World tiles are referred to as tiles.&#10;&#10;2.    Draw 3 tiles from the stack. From these 3 tiles, flip 1 over to the grid side to form the Outer Void (This is represented by the faced down tile O in the diagram), 1 to form the Inner Gate (This is represented by the faced down tile I in the diagram).&#10;&#10;3.    Gain the Oinks matched by the elemental insignias of the last remaining tile and discard it, an area such as X can be designated for discarded tiles in the diagram.&#10;&#10;All world tiles built are placed faced up with their elemental insignias visible. Tiles A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H surrounding tile I forms the Boundary. To fulfill winning condition 2,  the sum of the number of elemental insignias on the Tiles A, B, C; Tiles C,E, H; Tiles F,G, H and Tiles A, D, F are equal.&#10;&#10;On each turn&#10;&#10;Draw 3 tiles from the stack and the player must perform ONE of each of the following actions in the following order:&#10;&#10;1.    Gain - Play a tile, gain the Oinks indicated on the elemental insignias and discard it. Put the Oinks gained in the Inner Gate.&#10;&#10;2.    Build - Build a tile, if it is the first tile, place it adjacent to the Inner Gate, if it is not, it must be placed adjacent to another tile that has been built that bears at least one of its own elemental insignias. If the intended location is adjacent to two or more world tiles, then all adjacent world tiles must bear at least one matching elemental insignia between them.&#10;&#10;If you are unable to or do not wish to build for any reason, gain the Oinks indicated on any one of the remaining tiles that has not been played and put them into the Outer Void. You can also replace any tile built with any tile in your hand but all Oinks placed on the built tile will be placed in the Outer Void.&#10;&#10;3.    Move - Play a tile, you can move Oinks indicated on the elemental insignias of this tile from the Inner Gate to any built tile, or to move any Oink from a built tile to an adjacent built tile. If you are unable to or do not wish to move any of the Oinks indicated for any reason, gain the Oinks instead and put them into the Outer Void.&#10;&#10;The player cannot skip any action and each action must be fulfilled in totality. E.g.  During a Move action, a tile with 3 Fire Insignias has been chosen but the player has only 1 Fire Oink in the Inner Gate. You may NOT move the existing 1 Fire Oink to any other tile, gain 2 Fire Oinks and then placed them in the Outer Void. 3 Fire Oinks should be gained and placed in the Outer Void.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;For each Oink placed in a tile that bears the same insignia, gain 1 Victory Point. The player with the most Victory Points wins the final victory if multiple players are competing. Ties are broken by the difference in Oinks between their Outer Void and Inner Gate. The player with the greater difference wins. If the differences are the same, the players shared a joint victory.&#10;&#10;Variant&#10;&#10;The game can be scaled up with a BOUNDARY with sides featuring more tiles. (E.g 4 or 5). The rest of the rules remain unchanged. In this case, players can choose to leave the space representing the Inner Gate empty instead of a faced down tile I. Players can choose to use other appropriate counters to represent Oinks during play.&#10;&#10;"

Each turn a player asks another player if he/she has one particular card. If the other player has that card he/she has to give it away to the one asking for it. Then the player can continue asking for cards. If a player don&acute;t have the card you asking for, the turn go over to the other player. When you have all cards from one family you can put it down in front of you. The goal of the game is to collect as many sets of families as possible. The game is based on the character Doctor Snuggels created by Jeffrey O'Kelly.&#10;&#10;"

One circle of each player is placed in the center together with the circle of the other players so that these circles touch each other, so to speak, form a square. The remaining circles are laid out in a circle around this center square with about a hand's width between them; there should be space between the circles and circles of the same color should not be directly adjacent or too close together. The 36 shape cards in six colors - yellow, orange, blue, purple, dark green and red - are laid out in an unordered pile, with each shape once per color.&#10;&#10;The active player rolls the dice and takes any shape card of that color and places it on the table so that it touches a circle or another already existing shape card. If there is no matching shape card left in the supply, take any card of that color from the table and place it somewhere else. In this way, each player tries to be the first to connect his own circles with shape cards. The player who succeeds first is the immediate winner.&#10;&#10;Cheerful, colorful, simple and an enjoyable, loose practice of spatial imagination and use of space; for example, you can put the fish and the starfish mouth to tip, or put the head of the gobbler in the crook of the starfish or mushroom - so you can overcome long distances, or avoid making it too easy for the other players to connect their own circles faster.&#10;&#10;"
