Each player has a &quot;king&quot; (the Communication and Command Pod, or C.C.P.) that must be captured for the opponent to win.  The board is 15-by-15 squares, divided into 9 5x5 sections.  And there is a repeating pattern of walls that restrict movement.  The basic movement mechanic is that each piece (individually called &quot;Pods&quot;) moves a given number of segments, called &quot;Direction Changes&quot; or D.C.'s.  For example, a piece with 3 D.C.'s could move forward as many spaces as it wants (subject to walls of course), then left as many spaces as it wants, and then forward again.  Pods must move their entire number of D.C.'s without backtracking.&#10;&#10;In addition to the basic movement mechanic of D.C.'s, many of the pieces  have additional movement abilities, such as the Jump Pod (J.P.) that can jump over one piece during its movement, or the Variable Direction Change Pod (V.D.C.P.) which has a choice as to how many D.C.'s it may make when it moves.&#10;&#10;There is a basic game (nine pods), and an advanced version which adds four more pods.  They give an even more advanced version (which they call &quot;POD Pinnacle&quot;) in which the nine board parts are set up in a non-standard way.  You can also combine two sets together for a four-player game (assuming the pieces are of four different colors), and presumably, you could combine even more sets together for as many players as you want, as long as you have some means of distinguishing each player's pieces from the others.&#10;&#10;"

In shifting their forces to try and limit American expansion, the Spanish-loyal authorities opened the door to losing the remainder of two continents. Guerra a Muerte depicts the 14 year struggle that saw Spain's possessions in the hemisphere change from &quot;almost everything not U.S.&quot; to &quot;Cuba and Hispanola.&quot;&#10;&#10;As in the American Revolution, the local population could be divided into &quot;patriots/revolutionaries&quot; on one side, &quot;loyalists/Royalists&quot; on the other, and a huge middle block of those who wished to stay out of battle--over which both sides exerted tremendous pressure, making these episodes as bitter as a period in history.

Each player places his checkers in the back row of his side of the board.  The game turns alternate between the two players.  The number of checkers in a stack determines the distance that a stack may move.  Moves can be made in any of the eight corresponding directions and cannot be blocked by stacks situated in the path of the move.  All moves are done in a straight line unless the move would extend through 6 by 6 grid formation, in which case the move is reflected by the edge of the 6 by 6 grid like a mirror.  A stack belongs to the player whose piece is on top.  It might be noted that the arrangement and order of the pieces within a stack can never be altered except by continued stacking.  Captured stacks always remain on the board and become part of the stack must be included in the count for the new movement distance.  A player may use his turn to place a stack on top of another one of his own stacks.  During a turn a player has the option of moving one of his stacks or only its top portion which may include any number of pieces and may leave behind a stack also composed of any number of pieces.  The height of the new divided stack determines the new movement distance.&#10;&#10;In 2005, the &quot;Too-Tall Rule&quot; or variant was introduced.

After carefully considering all the given facts and without consulting any other player each investigator checks the two courses of action that he/she feels should now be taken.&#10;&#10;After all players have decided on their particular course of actions a blue sheet is read which gives both benefits and penalties to each player depending on what decisions they have made.  If both of the choices that an investigator makes are good the player will collect money from the kitty, if both are bad ones the player will pay into the kitty, if one is good and one is bad there will be a net plus/minus total which will create a small gain or loss.&#10;&#10;Now the next page of the crime is read and the another set of 10 possible actions will be given from which each player can choose two courses of action.

At the end of the game all players who have more money than what they started with sort of win with the player with the most money being the overall winner of the game.
