Days of Honor: Operation Wildhorn III &ndash; is a fast-paced, tactical card wargame for two players. The first player takes the role of the Polish commander. His goal is to collect fragments from rockets test-fired from the German missile base. The second player takes the role of the German commander and is trying to protect the secrets of the rocket testing area.&#10;&#10;The game lasts four turns. Each turn begins with a missile test, which scatters new fragments of the rocket in the peripheral area surrounding the testing ground. Players alternately take turns during which they place their units on the table and perform actions. Players use scouts to collect missile fragments, but they need to be protected by soldiers and partisans because enemy contact can lead to combat. These actions are supported by elite units: Polish Unseen and Silent commandos and German SS Stormtroopers, who are able to penetrate enemy lines. In addition, players build a network of command and support units, which allows them to effectively carry out their actions.&#10;&#10;Players also affect the course of the game during their opponent's moves, playing cards for immediate effects. And each side has a set of unique events, e.g., Germans can use their logistical advantages while Poles can hide, and even evacuate rocket fragments to England! To determine combat and exploration results, players each use a six-sided die, but they have many opportunities to modify the results, so a good plan should work even with bad luck.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the player with more rocket parts wins. This means the player successfully stole (Polish) or concealed (German) the secrets of the V-2 weapon.&#10;&#10;"

Criteria was to use up to 20 playing cards and 10 game cubes and nothing else.&#10;&#10;To play, all you need are the A-9 in 2 suits from a deck of cards and 10 game cubes. Each player gets a suit and organizes the cards according to rankings.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place the number of cubes equal to the card number in play onto the table/floor. Organize the cubes to mimic the pattern of the pips on the playing card with ample space between cubes.&#10;&#10;Grab an extra cube, toss it into the air, flip over your hand and quickly pick up all the cubes representing your card, and then catch the tossed cube in the same hand.&#10;&#10;Complete a card and move on to the next one on your turn.

You do this by tossing 1 cube in the air and, with the same hand, scoop up cubes from the table, then catch the tossed cube in that same hand... without dropping any cubes.&#10;&#10;Components: 10 cubes &amp; 18 poker cards: A-9 of hearts or diamonds and A-9 of spades or clubs.&#10;&#10;Set-up: Place the 10 cubes between both players. &#10;The 9 red cards go to one player, the 9 black to the other. &#10;Each divides her pack into 3 parts: Ace, 2-5, 6-9. &#10;Each places their Ace face-down on the table/floor. Then they shuffle their 2,3,4,5 cards and place them, face down on top of the Ace, each forming her own unique stack. Players both shuffle the 6,7,8,9 cards and each place them face-down on their stacks. &#10;Both players flip over their stacks so the Aces are face-up. Neither looks at the cards below. &#10;Player who is closest to 9 years of age goes first.&#10;&#10;Play: First player places 1 cube on the table/floor. She tosses another cube in the air and, with that same hand, scoops up the table cube, and then catches the tossed cube in the same hand with the cube she picked up... without dropping any cubes. Do this and you accomplish the card!&#10;&#10;If the first player fails to accomplish this (she dropped a cube or didn't catch the tossed cube), her turn is over and play moves to her opponent who attempts her own Ace card (picking up 1 cube).  &#10;Once a player successfully completes the Ace card, she places it on the bottom of her stack. This reveals her next card. It will be a 2,3,4, or 5. Her turn continues.&#10;&#10;For cards 2-9, players place that number of cubes on the table, following the pattern of the pips/symbols on the card. All cubes should have at least a 1/8 inch space between them if you are playing with 1/2 inch cubes. Handicap players to even out skill, by adding more space or using less space between cubes. Here's what cubes will look like on the table for cards 3, 5, 6, 8:&#10;&#10;A player's turn lasts until she fails to accomplish a card (drops cubes or fails to catch the tossed cube). This card stays face-up on top of her stack and she will re-start with this card on her next turn. Likewise, her opponent starts with the card that was left face-up on her own deck at the end of her last turn.  Once you are using cards greater than 4, you will have to re-arrange the cubes on the table each time your turn starts.&#10;&#10;Turns continue back and forth. Players will be going for different cards most of the time. As each card is accomplished, it's placed on the bottom of the deck and the next card is immediately attempted on the same turn.&#10;&#10;Winner: First player to successfully make it through all 9 of her cards wins. If she went first, the other player gets one last turn to catch her. If there is a tie, re-play the 9 card and first wins!&#10;&#10;"

Different colors of flowers are available in different quantities, with forty flowers in all.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds; at the start of each round, flowers are randomly drawn and placed in the middle of the playing area. Players then take turns removing flowers from the supply and planting them in their garden. These flowers then attract the ten butterflies in the game. Some butterflies match the color of a flower, and these fly to the garden with the biggest connected flower bed of this color. Other butterflies match two flower colors, and these are attracted to the biggest combined flower bed of these two colors. All butterflies prefer fresh flowers, so creating a flower patch equal in size to an opponent's garden is enough to lure the butterfly from that other garden to yours.&#10;&#10;Having butterflies in your garden brings you points at the end of each round. New butterflies score one point at the end of round one, two points in round two, etc. Butterflies which remain in your garden throughout a round score only half as many points. (Because seeing new species in your garden is more cool.)&#10;&#10;Who will prove to be the best gardener?&#10;&#10;"

Paragraphs are read in sequence as determined by the rules and tables, describing new situations, locations and characters, providing clues and throwing red herrings in your path in your pursuit of the truth.

You will need all three booklets and a few 6-sided dice (d6) to play the game. Future expansions will be available to supplement the rules, develop existing cases and solve new crimes.&#10;&#10;You will read various numbered sections one after another but the sequence of paragraphs is determined by rules and tables.

Ultimately it is also about your skill as a role player to piece the elements together.&#10;&#10;SHDSG is an adventure game played in turns. A standard turn starts with you selecting an Action, such as Exploring, Planning or Investigating before. Generally in an Adventure, you will try to defeat a Villain.
