So you pay money for the troops into the bank where you are hiring them and you get money for taxes from the bank where you tax your people (only in provinces you control). The results are richer and poorer provinces - with usually the richer provinces closer to the front lines (since that's where you want to hire troops).&#10;&#10;Troops come in different types, with different movement ranges and fighting strengths.&#10;&#10;Two German grade-school designers invented this game, which was chosen by the Deutsche Kinderhilfswerk to receive a grant, and G&uuml;nter Cornett at Bambus Spieleverlag has been helping the two develop the game over the past 2+ years.&#10;&#10;"

Each captain has to make the same type of decisions that a cricket captain would normally make during a game, namely:&#10;&#10;&#10;     In what order to use his batsmen (four &quot;top&quot; batsmen, four &quot;medium&quot;, and three &quot;tail&quot;); typically you would use your best batsmen first, as they have no individual characteristics such as skill against a certain type of bowling.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     When to use his bowlers (two &quot;strike&quot; bowlers with one over each, two &quot;medium&quot; bowlers with two overs each, and two &quot;spin&quot; bowlers with two overs each). The rules suggest using your strike bowlers first to get the best batsmen out.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Where to place his fieldsmen; the bowler and wicket keeper have to be in their designated positions on the board, but the other nine can be placed in any one of 21 other named positions (mid-off, mid-on, extra cover, etc.). This seems to be where most of the decision-making takes place.&#10;&#10;&#10;Once the batsmen, bowler, and fieldsmen are in place and ready, a bowler/batsman matchup table is consulted to determine which of three coloured dice is rolled:&#10;&#10;&#10;     the black die (1,1,2,3,3,4), which favours neither batsman nor bowler&#10;     the blue die (1,2,3,4,4,6), which favours the batsman&#10;     the red die (1,1,1,2,2,4), which favours the bowler&#10;&#10;&#10;The indicated die is rolled. On a six, the batsman simply scores six runs (the maximum). On a 1 to 4, a card is drawn from the relevant deck, there being four named &quot;Card One&quot; to &quot;Card Four&quot;). Each card has three possible outcomes, one for each type of bowler. The relevant outcome is evaluated based on the positions of the fieldsmen. For example, one of the &quot;Card Three&quot; cards says this for the &quot;strike&quot; bowler:&#10;&#10;&quot;Driven in the air for some distance but a bad bounce beats mid-off who stumbles after it for 2 runs. No mid-off, 3 runs. No long-off, 4 runs.&quot;&#10;&#10;Some cards call for the red die to be rolled, in which case the batsman must roll a 1 NOT to be given out (50% chance).&#10;&#10;The innings is over once ten batsmen are out or ten overs have been completed. Each team has one innings, after which the team with the higher score wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Players are planning cathedral layout and overseeing work at the construction site in tandem, in the same time trying to gain advantage over the opposite player.&#10;&#10;The temple is built by laying square tiles adjacent to the board or already built tiles. Tiles form the plan of the cathedral. These tiles, distinguished by four colors, represent different elements of the cathedral. The pool of tiles available to players is random. Later, the players place pawns on the tiles &ndash; these pawns are the teams of builders: foremen, masons and carpenters, who will make the design a reality.&#10;&#10;The players strive to achieve two goals: to lay their cathedral tiles so as to create the largest possible areas representing a single color, and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.&#10;&#10;Every tile bears also one special action that could be played instead of adding a tile to the cathedral. Using these actions player may move pawns from tile to tile, promote them (increasing their value) or manipulate the tiles. Execution of specific order excludes the tile from being used as part of cathedral, so choice between expanding the edifice and making some action is strategic. Planning and optimal use of available resources is important, as both participants share the same selection of tiles. Thus, tiles and actions shown on them not used by the player in her or his turn become immediately available to his opponent.&#10;&#10;Some tiles trigger movement of a special King pawn, which moves along the scoring track. Every few moves, the King pawn comes to a space indicating a royal visit to the cathedral. During each royal visit, the progress of work is assessed and Victory Points are assigned to the players. The number of VPs each player is awarded depends on the size and number of the areas controlled by their pawns at the moment of scoring. The more areas the player controls, and the bigger these are, the greater the reward for the player. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has claimed more Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Basilica was reissued in 2022 in a new version that includes the expansion.&#10;&#10;"
