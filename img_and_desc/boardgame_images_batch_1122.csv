You are a plant, who for obvious reasons is into that sort of thing. You also have a lot more power and agency over your environment than humans often give you credit for. Use chemical inputs to sculpt the soil&rsquo;s weird and wonderful biodiversity to assemble vibrant ecological communities.&#10;&#10;The goal of Loam is to build the healthiest possible soil by creating the most balanced and biodiverse ecosystem possible. To do this, you use inputs to place creatures in your root zone. Each creature you attract adds certain stats to your soil profile!&#10;&#10;Every turn, you must play all three of your inputs. Inputs are action cards that allow you to place creatures in your root zone, alter the soil, or draw creature cards to your hand. Once you've played all three, your turn ends.&#10;&#10;At end of game, all players calculate the points each community is worth, as well as their balance bonus. Highest score wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The player who best handles the characteristics set by the player in turn wins the round.&#10;&#10;The game was developed in conjunction with a scientific article in which the statistical values associated with each of the parameters of the cards were analyzed, so the values in each of them correspond to the results of the study.&#10;&#10;Introduction of the associated article:&#10;In Latin America, the use of wildlife for different purposes is ancestral; In the last decades, the use of subsistence, that of local sale, sportive and commercial hunting stands out. The latter, related to the potential and the value or interest that exists in the species that is the object of the same. From the perspective of the agricultural sector, it seeks to meet demands for current anthropic uses such as food, skins, pets, scientific research or conservation, based on the sustainable management of wild populations.&#10;&#10;To guarantee the sustainable use and management of wildlife, it is necessary to establish parameters and management criteria that are generated from scientific, cultural and socioeconomic knowledge of the species that we believe have some type of productive potential. Currently one of the challenges facing the agricultural sector is the development of innovative proposals that are consistent with the social, environmental and economic needs of the country. The assessment of the potential of wild species in Colombia is of vital importance to face these challenges.&#10;&#10;In this document an approximation to the conceptual definition of zootechnical potential of a wild species is made and an evaluation of this potential is made for 48 species of wild fauna (native and exotic) that have been traditionally used in Colombia. The results are also part of a didactic strategy based on the evaluation of the zootechnical potential of wild fauna species, as a proposal for pedagogical innovation (cards attached to this booklet).&#10;&#10;"
