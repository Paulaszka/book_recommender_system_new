The goal of the Battle Command system is to provide a way for various conflicts across different eras to be fought with minimal time wasted on setup and complex rules, making this both a great introductory system for new and veteran players alike.&#10;&#10;Battle Command (BC) is a refinement and simplification of the old FAB game series. The scope is the same, with higher echelons, artillery, events, and combat assets that can be assigned as available. FAB rules have been streamlined in the BC series. Most players do not need to pick up the rulebook after the first turn or two, as everything you need to play has been printed on the map, including a flow-chart with extended sequence of play so that no turn segment will be overlooked, and your attention will be placed solely on the battle at hand. Special rules needed for each event are printed directly on the event cards, so you can play them and forget them without having to refer to the rulebook.&#10;&#10;Each Battle Command volume includes TWO different games in one box. Volume I brings players to the forests of the Battle of the Bulge, and the sun, heat, and sand of North Africa during Operation Crusader. The design emphasis has been placed on making the game player-friendly and manageable in its level of scope, difficulty, and time of play. With a low total counter count and density, these quick playing simulations present players with deep strategy meriting contemplation. A system of map areas has been adopted, and movement has been streamlined.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

If you own both boxes, you will also have enough base decks to play the 2v2 variant as well.&#10;&#10;Casino Heist:&#10;A team of thieves and swindlers have taken the Majestic Casino for all its worth. The suspects were rounded up easy enough, but proving their guilt conclusively will be difficult. The defendants seem overly confident within the court room. Is it just a fa&ccedil;ade as their scheme crumbles down around them? Or do they have one last trick up their sleeves?&#10;&#10;In the Heist case, the prosecution is attempting to convict a majority of the gang responsible for the heist while the defense is doing their best to get as many swindlers exonerated as possible. These defendants are running the long con! Throughout the case they will be dealt double-sided Con cards. Players will be competing to assign these Cons to defendants and flip them to the side that benefits them the most. A defendant's trial is resolved and scored when they complete their long con and are dealt 3 Con cards. It is essential to deal the final Con to the defendant's you're winning to score them. The player who convicts or exonerates the most defendants wins.&#10;&#10;The Divorce:&#10;The Divorce case expansion focuses on a high profile celebrity divorce case between a billionaire tech CEO and 90s Television Star. This is a more symmetrical case with each player taking on the role of one of the celebrities of the marriage. You can play as a Sam, the super rich tech CEO or as Adrian, the TV celebrity. Both Sam and Adrian's cards are dual-sided male/female so you can create any kind of marriage/relationship that you prefer.&#10;&#10;One of the new mechanics in this case are secret Attitude cards. Each of these cards represents the emotional state of each partner and matches one of the bias symbols in the game. It's possible for your attitude to change throughout the course of the divorce proceedings but each one gives you extra victory points for marital assets with the matching bias symbol on them.&#10;&#10;The other big change for the Divorce case is that you'll be fighting over (and swaying) marital asset cards rather than the jury. Each Asset card is double-sided and has an asymmetrical track where you can spend influence to sway bias. The victory point values on each asset are scored by the player who wins the asset (if in their color) but assets can also be shared between players. This allows the Divorce case to be played competitively or cooperatively based on the strategies chosen by each side leading to amicable splits, financial victories, or spiteful losses. Will you compromise for the sake of the children or drag each other through the mud to get the most assets?&#10;&#10;The Private Eye:&#10;The Private Eye Case expansion sees the defense take on the role of private investigator in a 1950s Hollywood noir setting where they have been framed for the murder of a popular film star. The private eye will need to divide their time between investigating clues to solve the real murder and defending themselves in court. The prosecution works with conspirators and ring leaders to gain red herrings to hinder this investigation.&#10;&#10;This case features a lot of new mechanics that shake up the core game. As the defense, you will be working to reveal cards from clue decks to discover WHO murdered the starlet with WHAT weapon WHERE in the city. Like the game Clue, each clue card eliminates one of the possibilities. The dilemma is that in order to investigate and reveal clues, you will need to play evidence cards for their Investigation effect instead of using them in the courtroom to influence the jury. If the Private Eye is able to correctly guess the murderer, weapon and crime scene they will win the game, but they need to make sure that they don't ignore the trial where the chips are stacked against them.&#10;&#10;The prosecution represents a vast conspiracy of witnesses trying to frame the private investigator. Their goal is clearly focused on winning the trial and they will do their best to draft and utilize planted evidence in the courtroom. The prosecution will earn Red Herring tokens as they sway and manipulate the jury which they can place on the clue decks to hinder the PI's investigation.&#10;&#10;Solo Expansion:&#10;The Solo Expansion expands on the solo mode in the base game by adding a new solo base deck, a bias die, Automa personality cards, and case-specific card effects that work with every case released thus far. If you're a player looking to get into the nitty gritty of the rules, read on!&#10;&#10;The new Solo Base Deck is shuffled together with the drafted case cards for the Automa. All the effects on these cards have been written with solo play in mind. The Automa's procedures act like traps that players will have to work around.&#10;&#10;The Automa is further expanded with additional cards that let players build an Automa player. By selecting a Personality card, a Discovery card, and the Questioning card corresponding to the Automa&rsquo;s role in the selected case, there are tons of unique Automa effects and combinations to explore.&#10;&#10;The new Automa rules reduce die rolling and create unique puzzles to work around each witness as players will want to avoid triggering procedures and sidebar abilities that can set them back.&#10;&#10;"

The fort was a Confederate stronghold on the Cumberland River, and key to the rebels retaining control of Kentucky and Tennessee. General Ulysses S. Grant&rsquo;s Army of the Tennessee and Admiral Andrew H. Foote&rsquo;s ironclad gunboats had laid siege to the Confederate fort, trapping the Confederate Army of Central Kentucky. On the morning of February 15th the rebels launched a desperate attack in attempt to breakout. Can you do as well or better?&#10;&#10;Each copy of Battle's Shadow is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;Two 11 by 17 inch map sheets&#10;176 un-mounted, double-sided counters&#10;8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Each turn in Battle&rsquo;s Shadow represents one hour of time. Infantry and Cavalry units represent regiments (III) or battalions (II). A hex on the map is approximately 200 meters across. Battle's Shadow is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Tim Allen.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Strategically place them to gain bonuses and grow your hex power. However, as the town of Superstition grows, so does its tension level.&#10;&#10;When the tension finally &quot;breaks&quot;, a hex-slinging gun fight erupts! &quot;Sling&quot; your hex cards to defeat your opponent's folk and shatter their buildings and their protective spells.&#10;&#10;The surviving player with the most points (calculated using a variety of methods from set collection to building strength) is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

RuneScape Kingdoms: Shadow of Elvarg is a cooperative campaign board game inspired by the record-breaking video game universe with over 280 million registered users worldwide.&#10;&#10;Gather your group of 1-5 players and step into a sometimes epic, often irreverent fantasy world where your goal is simple: Become the wealthiest, most skilled, best-geared adventurer there is! Or, just enough of all three to succeed together. Or spend the whole time collecting eggs and let your friends do all the work. It&rsquo;s cooperative, after all! (Still, who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy a little friendly competition?)&#10;&#10;Either way, Gielinor needs capable folk to help its inhabitants and keep monsters and nefarious cults at bay, and that&rsquo;s where your group steps in. One minute you&rsquo;re slaying a vampyre that&rsquo;s been terrorising a village. The next, you&rsquo;re helping Gertrude find her beloved cat!&#10;&#10;Like chapters in a book, your tabletop adventure is split into campaigns, each one inspired by an iconic boss quest from the video games. Campaigns are made up of two phases:&#10;&#10;First is the exploration phase, where you&rsquo;ll explore the kingdoms of Asgarnia and Misthalin from above on a game board styled like a fast-travel map. Every location gives you different things to do &mdash; whether that&rsquo;s gathering and sharing resources, levelling up skills, or drawing from the exploration deck for that region to see what unexpected thing you&rsquo;ll need to handle next!&#10;&#10;Don&rsquo;t get too distracted, though: The exploration phase has set quests you&rsquo;ll need to complete to keep your group moving forward. Spend too long gathering cabbages or engaging in goblin diplomacy, and the escalation track will rise, making the world around you more dangerous until you finally take on the boss&hellip;&#10;&#10;&hellip;in the boss phase! Here, you&rsquo;ll zoom in for face-to-face fights on dedicated game boards that bring the bosses &mdash; and their environments &mdash; to life!&#10;&#10;The story woven through the campaigns will immerse you in the fantasy world of RuneScape, while the optional side quests, exploration decks, vault deck, and event deck will change your experience each time you play. And because it&rsquo;s an open world, you can play your way!&#10;&#10;Even your adventurer starts as a blank slate. There are no fixed classes in this game! You choose what skills to max and what gear to craft. Use those skills and gear to pass tests and complete quests to help your group win the day, then take what you&rsquo;ve learned and earned on to the next campaign. Gain XP (even when you fail!) and rewards, and level up to earn your all-important cape!&#10;&#10;But it&rsquo;s not all capes and capers. At the end of every campaign waits a boss that&rsquo;ll take all the skills of your group &mdash; yes, even cooking &mdash; to defeat. Pulled into face-to-face combat on unfamiliar terrain, your group&rsquo;s shared health pool is all that stands between you and Death (and he wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased to see you!). Roll the dice on your melee, defence, and magic to strike, protect yourself, and push the boss back. Use your wits to plan ahead and influence the flow of combat to throw the boss off balance. And don&rsquo;t expect them to take your onslaught lying down. They, too, have ways to keep you on your toes&hellip;&#10;&#10;"
