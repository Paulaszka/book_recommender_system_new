Team based where you can only hang your monkeys off of your teammate's monkeys. For ages 3 and up.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Monkey Business&#10;    Monkeying Around&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The rules, mecha stats are on the back along with a postcard. (If you mail the postcard, you will lose half the board.) The board has no grid or hexes, so the game has a miniatures flavor. Rules are very short and simple with turn order being determined each phase by rolling and adding a mental stat. Mechs move and fight with ranged weapons, until losing all their hit points.&#10;&#10;"

Fry, the author of the popular Napoleonic tactical naval game Fire As She Bears! to bring you a supplement which enables you to fight the war at sea as the Admiralty of a nation, subject to the whims of the crown and to generate gritty battles where sailing skills and cunning decide the fate of the battle.&#10;&#10;This is a stand alone book that requires no other VBAM Games products to play, although Starboard Tack Press&rsquo; Fire As She Bears! Second Edition is highly recommended for a complete Age of Sail experience.&#10;&#10;"

There are two versions of the game: a version designed exclusively for two players and a four-player version. The 1986 versions comes with manufactured components of a much higher quality than previous editions including:&#10;&#10;Four high quality color map boards that fit together &quot;puzzle&quot; style, two bags of colored 3-D playing pieces representing ancients-era military units, a four-page rulebook (two double-sided pages), and an attractive storage box.&#10;&#10;Set in a time of ancient warfare, Conquest is a strategy game that emphasizes strategic movement, sort of like an upgraded version of Chess. Players control different combinations of foot troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications and/or occupy the &quot;quest&quot; locations. There are several scenarios included in the short rule book (Really a booklet!) and players are encouraged to design their own.&#10;&#10;Though confusing in name, Conquest is a re-implementation of this game with the same name but with play up to four players.&#10;&#10;"

Instead of his left-jab through lowland Holland to the Rhine, we have Patton's proposed right-hook, starting at Metz and swinging north and east toward the Ruhr for a war-winning knockout blow. Or, as an alternative within an alternative, the Allied player may try for a more conservative push straight east to the Rhine, there to create a bridgehead over that German river, thereby likely advancing the advent of V-E Day by at least three or four months.&#10;&#10;As soon as you begin to game Patton's alternative to Montgomery's all or nothing plan, it becomes clear what a huge opportunity Eisenhower missed by backing the wrong subordinate. That is, for the British field marshal's plan to have succeeded, it really did have to go all the way, or at least get across the Rhine in some significant way. Failing short of both the Rhine and the Ruhr, as happened historically, meant a month had been wasted and a lot of lives lost only to create a salient to nowhere. Had Patton's idea been tried, only to fail as badly, a salient of that same size &ndash; but  jutting north into the Rhineland from a base at Metz &ndash; would've done much more for the Allied cause.&#10;&#10;We've broadened the appeal of this design beyond those who enjoy alternative history by including a second, historical, scenario. At first we were only going to cover the actual Market-Garden portion of Montgomery's operations in September 1944. It quickly became apparent, however, portrayed at these time, space and unit scales, such a game would be a dud, with a map only nine hexes long and three wide. So we broadened the thing's shoulders by expanding the coverage to take in all Montgomery's possibilities that fateful month. So now you can choose a straight-up historic approach, or you can have alternative history within your actual history.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map equals seven miles from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents three days. Playing pieces represent divisions, brigades, combat commands, Kampfgruppen and regiments of various kinds of infantry and armor formations, each containing from about 3,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 or so armored fighting vehicles.&#10;&#10;"
