The other progenitor game for Dong Wu Qi is Lu Zhan Jun Qi and it would be accurate to describe Dong Wu Qi as a hybrid between Dou Shou Qi and Lu Zhan Jun Qi.&#10;&#10;In brief, the 8 kinds of animals in Dou Shou Qi are doubled for each player and pieces are placed face down on the board as in Lu Zhan Jun Qi rather than face up as in Dou Shou Qi. The board has similarities with Lu Zhan Jun Qi, with safe areas for animals to move into, and a base at each end of the board which the opponent is trying to get an animal into. The hierarchy of pieces is the same as in Dou Shou Qi, with the Elephant as the strongest piece, but susceptible to the Mouse.&#10;&#10;Play is as in Lu Zhan Jun Qi - pieces are known only to their owner and combat (when a piece moves onto another) is resolved by a third person acting as a referee.&#10;&#10;Unlike the traditional games of Dou Shou Qi and Lu Zhan Jun Qi, which many companies manufacture, Dong Wu Qi appears only to be made by one or two companies - currently, Da Fu Weng (Uncle Wang) produces this game.&#10;&#10;"

These planets are home to the Plonx and the Quirx, who both feel they are the better tribe. The more common galactic option to prove superiority, open warfare, has been abandoned. Instead both tribes go head to head in an annual contest, using their ability to manipulate the speed with which their tribe's planets turn around the suns. The tribe that is most skillful at manipulating the planets in such a way that it manages to establish contact between tribe-members on neighboring planets most often, wins the tournament and gains the brag rights for that year.&#10; This is a highly abstract space game for 2 players that is a slight step away for a designer that is better known as a safe pair of hands for decent children's and family games. Manfred Ludwig shows here he can be equally at home with challenging the more abstract gamer as within its simplicity lies an engaging little dice less strategy game that isn't spectacular, but works surprisingly well.&#10;&#10;The board shows a large sun on each corner of a hexagonal, and a seventh sun right in the middle of it. Another 3 lines are drawn that divide the hexagonal in 6 equal pizza slices. Then 6 planets are placed at equal distance in circular orbits around each sun, in such a way that the planets closest to a foreign sun are directly facing a planet of that sun. These are the possible meeting points.&#10;&#10;Each player get 5 contact chips and places one tribe planet around each sun on the prescribed starting places. Then, in turn, each player moves one own planet. When a player ends a move by making &quot;contact&quot; with another planet of the own tribe, that player  claims one contact-chip of the opponent. The first player to own all chips wins the tournament.&#10;&#10;Movement follows a strict pattern. Each player can only move one (own) planet each turn. The first player moves a planet exactly one space clockwise, the other player gets to move two spaces. Then moves of three, four and five spaces follow, and when a player has moved five spaces, the whole sequence gets repeated, starting with one. Planets can overtake each other, but moves that would result in planets landing on each other are blocked and force a player to move one of the other planets instead. In the rare cases that a player cannot move any own planets, the opponent gets to move instead.&#10;&#10;Publishing history: this abstract game appeared in the German game magazine P&ouml;ppel-Revue (1987/2 April-MAY) as that edition's &quot;Das Spiel im Heft&quot;. A pull-out board and rules were provided, players still needed to supply their own pieces (2x7 pawns and 10 contact-chips).&#10;&#10;"

Simultaneously, each player then tries to sweep the 'good' garbage into their own tray and the 'bad' garbage into opponents' trays. Score points for the good trash - a single piece of one kind of trash scores 5 points, two of a kind scores 15 points and three of a kind scores 25 points.

Ho Chi Minh had requested cease fire negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and the French government was looking for a way out that would give them peace with honor.

The surrounded Russian regiment fought well and bled for it. The Tigers, Elephants and Brummbars became the King of the battlefield until met by the Russian Beast-eaters. Once the Germans had encircled the Russians in the first defensive line, there was a slight problem: their supporting infantry lagged far to the rear and what infantry had arrived was far too few to destroy the pocket. Immediately ahead was the 2nd Russian defensive line, manned by a Guards infantry division with armor. The first defensive line had crumbled under the classic German pincer movement, but German reserves were not ready to be committed. Nevertheless, piercing the 2nd Defensive belt and reaching the critical hills further south was not the same animal. It was nothing less than a head-on, in your face, battle.

It can only be played by 3 players exactly, and is, in essence, &quot;Nine Men's Morris&quot; for three.&#10;&#10;Each player gets 9 playing pieces and play starts with placement of these pieces onto the board. Clockwise, each player places a piece onto a free space until all pieces are on the board. From then on, in each turn, a player must move one marble to an immediately neighboring empty space. When this result in one or more &quot;Triads&quot; (three uninterrupted marbles of that player's color in a straight line), then that player removes an unprotected marble from one opponent. Extending an existing Triad does not count as creating a new one. The first player who reduced both opponents to 2 marbles each, is the winner.&#10;&#10;The designer has come up with a rules set that makes great use of the nature of a triangular grid, making Triapon a  much cleverer strategic game than a simple connect-3 on a triangle. A careful observer will notice that, besides the obvious Triad that is made on neighboring rows, there are two other straight lines along which Triads can be formed. If a &quot;short Triad&quot; uses 3 neighboring rows, a &quot;medium Triad&quot; uses holes that lay one row removed from each other, and a &quot;long Triad&quot; even has gaps of 2 rows between the marbles.&#10;&#10;Pieces get taken first from the opponent who has the most marbles left on board, and only vulnerable marbles can be removed. These are pieces that don't form part of any Triad, are in a Triad that gets crossed by a longer Triad, or are part of an extended Triad, but, when removed, leave the other marbles still in a Triad.&#10;&#10;And in the Nine Men's Morris tradition: when a player is reduced to just 3 pieces, that player gains the option to move a marble to any free space. The moment that a player has only 2 pieces left, that player is eliminated.&#10;&#10;This is, in broad lines, how standard Triapon is played. An entertaining variation in which blocking marbles are brought back onto the board is also included.&#10;&#10;Publishing history: released in 2 versions by the Swiss &quot;Murmel Spielwerkstatt und Verlag&quot; in 1999. The packing is as clever as the game itself: the board edges flap up to form a pyramid shaped box, neatly holding all the pieces. The deluxe board, or &quot;Triapon Classic&quot;, is made of 8-layer plywood and comes with 30 glass marbles  (10 in 3 colors) in a pouch. The cheaper version is made of cardboard, has a picture of a famous Swiss Alp printed on the outside, and is hence known as the &quot;Triapon Matterhorn&quot; edition.&#10;&#10;"
