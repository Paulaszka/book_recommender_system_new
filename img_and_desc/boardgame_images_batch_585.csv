Players each assume the role of a BattleMage frantically slinging spells from atop their castle's walls in an attempt to stall an endless onslaught of invading Monsters for as long as possible.&#10;&#10;The BattleMage who achieves the most honor by best defending their homeland will be awarded the title of Grand ArchMage and win the game!&#10;&#10;Players will collect spell cards in a classic deck-building fashion using 3 separate resources. Each spell card has an immediate effect as well as a lasting Resonance effect. These abilities are used to try and destroy an everlasting onslaught of monsters approaching the castle walls which will move toward the castle each turn as determined by the roll of dice. Defeated monsters are harvested into players' decks by the Soul Crystals they leave behind, to even further boost each player's deck during play.&#10;&#10;BattleMage is for 1-4 players (yes, there is a solitaire play variant!) and takes 45-60 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;"

It has mighty warriors, mysterious artifacts and deadly missiles. They are represented by disks of varying sizes and colors that have to be sent flying towards their targets with a well-aimed flick of a finger. Choose a side of the table and lead your order&rsquo;s army into a campaign of world conquest.&#10;&#10;Desktopia games can vary substantially. The battlefield landscape is formed by the random conglomeration of objects that can usually be found on your desk or table. These may include books, cups, your laptop, a mouse or a remote control. The game pack includes a set of riveting scenarios. You can take part in a massive melee, rob caravans, perform speed missions under a hail of arrows and even solve riddles!&#10;&#10;Each player will have his own small army represented by discs of different sizes and corresponding reference cards. Legendary heroes, tough veterans and faithful fighters each of them with unique abilities described on reference card will be at your disposal. Likewise there will be small missile disks, which can be used by some of your characters, and mighty artifacts, which you can take under control during the course of a battle.&#10;&#10;In your turn you can activate three of your characters: flick the disk to attack or use a missile instead or cast a spell. There are a lot of interesting choices you will have each time - whom and how to activate, trying to make a risky long short or just safely moving your warrior into an advantageous position for the next move. In this game your tactical choices are much more important than anything else. You also have to try to make the best use of the synergy of the different warrior types in your army!&#10;&#10;We actively encourage players to use everyday objects from their tables. Imagine a turned glass as a sphere of ice which could freeze some disks of your enemy, a book as an impregnable cliff, from which your archers could safely attack, or a vase as a control tower with 10 hit points.&#10;&#10;"

It is a land steeped in rune magic and blood, yet one where the various races &ndash; humans, elves, dwarfs, fauns, trolls, ogres, orcs, goblins and halflings &ndash; live in harmony, owing allegiance not to race but to one of the mighty factions that make up this war-torn kingdom.&#10;&#10;Twelve Elements of War is a 28mm Tabletop skirmish wargame. A typical warband will include between 7 - 12 models (depending on your faction and style of play), activating one model at a time. Players alternate turns activating models, keeping both players engaged and thinking. Despite only activating one model at a time, it successfully simulates combined attacks with multiple models; the first attacks in a round weaken and lock-down a model, making it easier to finish off by attackers later in a round.&#10;&#10;It uses a multiple D6 dice, one-roll system for all rolls during a battle. Roll a number of dice equal to the Model Statistic that you are using to attack/defend/employ, add bonus dice if you have an advantage of some type, like charging. Compare the result of this roll to the enemy model's statistic or enemy model's roll to see if you succeed. The dice system does not use charts or tables &amp; is used for all rolls, making the game extremely easy to learn.&#10;&#10;The broad range of Faction Lists each bring something special to the battlefield, and each faction choose from the 9 fantasy races. Each Faction is balanced to each other, despite having multiple fantasy races and at least 6 roles per Faction to choose from. Successfully employing a variety of different races performing melee, shooting or magic roles on the battlefield is the key to winning.&#10;&#10;Over 20 different mission combinations ensures that each game of Twelve Elements of War will different from the next. Creating a balanced warband is only the start; quick thinking, using the right model at the right time &amp; an assertive battleplan is the key to completing your objectives while denying your opponent theirs.&#10;&#10;The fun with Twelve Elements of War doesn't finish after one game. Twelve Elements of War has a complete Campaign system that sees your models gain experience, better abilities, new skills, money and magical runic items as they play battles and also explore the world of Lumria acquiring strange and unique items. You will also have the option to visit a town after each game. In town you can choose to go to the Tavern to recruit new members and heroes, The Market to purchase new items and equipment, the Arena to watch pit fighting and maybe pick up a few pointers. Lastly the Temple, where you can prey to the gods to heal your wounds or ask for their blessing in future battles. In addition to visiting these places, you roll on one of four unique &ldquo;random encounter charts&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Games can be played on a vast variety of battlefield types, from cautious tactical advances in the snow covered Forest of Sighs, to fast paced skirmishes leaping from building top to building top in the sprawling Port City of Arcadia.&#10;&#10;Lastly, with 100's of magical  item combinations to try out and over 36 unique runic spells to cast with your magic users, this game has a large amount of re-playability.&#10;&#10;Factions in the core book include:&#10;&#10;- The elite soldiers of Highguard, vying to restore their city-state to its former glory.&#10;- The tough, guerrilla warriors of the Mining Guild, seeking to control valuable mineral resources across the continent.&#10;- The Geniocracy of Toth, who strive to expand their knowledge of technology, science and magic &ndash; by sword&rsquo;s edge if need be. &#10;- The sorcerers of the Shadow Hold, adepts at runic magic, and served by thrall workers and brainwashed fighters. They scour the land for lost runic artifacts and raid other factions to capture   slaves. &#10;- The stern Keepers of Talon Crag Citadel, who have vowed to the gods to hunt down all who dare toy with the more dangerous aspects of runic magic.&#10;&#10;With more to follow n the future.&#10;&#10;"

The Kestrel Dominion, descending from ancient hereditary rulers and cherishing their ancestral tradition of honor; Nova Centralis, a plutocratic nation built upon exploiting wealth and greatly desirous of maintaining their economic edge; the Sylphian Commonwealth, a once-verdant land now poisoned by the aftereffects of the Engine&rsquo;s destruction; and the Grail Prelacy, a theocratic nation emboldened by prophecies of ultimate victory. Each empire vies to fulfill the prophecy and restore the Great Engine, the source of ultimate power.&#10;&#10;In Empire Engine, players take on the role of a mighty empire, powered by rotating gears. During the game, players simultaneously choose actions to attack, defend, salvage, export, or collect resources (goods for export, soldiers to attack your opponents and inventions to score points). Players use their gears to rotate their engines, and in each round perform the actions on the top edges of their engines. The player who scores the most points for the goods, soldiers and inventions in their score pile at the end of the game is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

Each player in turn has ninety seconds (sixty in the advanced game) to form the largest possible word.  Words must be composed of letters with the same background colour that are in a straight line from centre to outside of the board or vice versa, or in the form of a v.

Players secretly choose Tuatha deities to help them in battle as part of a clan as they fight for control of the lands and treasures of Ireland. They can also appeal to the Fomor for help of an underhanded sort or use the power of sacred items. Winning a battle for their clan gains Victory Points.&#10;&#10;The game continues for a series of rounds or until all the lands and their treasures are held by one clan. The player with the most Victory Points is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Needed to play - The deck of 54 cards and 2 eurocubes per player. Players may elect to keep score with pen and paper.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;&#10;Each round of the game is played in the same order of phases.&#10;&#10;Phase 1 - Battle Area. Depending on their chosen detiy, a player will choose which two cards in the Circle of Cards which will be the Battle Sites. The two cards chosen must show different Clan Holding Icons in the lower left. The cards must be adjacent to each other.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 - Choose Tuatha Ally. The current start player will shuffle the Tuatha Deck and discard two cards face down to the center of the Circle of Cards, and then choose one of the remaining cards from the deck, keeping it secret from the other players. They will then pass the rest of the deck the player to their left to choose a card from those that remain. The deck will be passed this way until each player has chosen a card. Any remaining cards are discarded to the center.&#10;&#10;Phase 3 - Reveal Warrior Cards. Each player, beginning with the current start player, will now play one or more Warrior Cards in front of them, face up for all other players to see. These Warrior Cards will add Battle Point Values, for their clans, to the respective Battle Site cards and their initial Battle Point Values.&#10;&#10;Players of the same clan are trying to beat the combined Battle Point Value of the other clan.&#10;&#10;Phase 4 - Reveal Tuatha Allies. Now each player will, in turn, reveal their hidden Tuatha Ally. The current start player will call out the numbers in order (from 1 to 7) and the player possessing that numbered card will reveal it and the power of that card may be used by the player. Tuatha allies are resolved in order.&#10;&#10;Phase 5 - Resolve Battle. After the Tuatha, and Sacred Item and Fomor powers have been resolved, total the Battle Point Values for each clan and compare. The winner is the clan with the most Battle Points. The losing clan&rsquo;s Battle Site card is flipped over to the other side to show the winning clan&rsquo;s alignment icon. In the case of a tie, no Battle Site cards are flipped and no Victory Points are awarded in Phase 6.&#10;&#10;Phase 6 - Victory Points. All players of the winning clan receive Victory Points as stated by the chart at the bottom the winning Battle Site card.

Amazing technological breakthroughs would change all of that in the year 2112. The invention of the Near Faster Than Light (NFTL) drive would make it possible for large ships to move easily in and out of a planet's gravity well, and to travel quickly within the confines of a solar system. Ten years later, the perfecting of Faster Than Light (FTL) drive would turn the galaxy into an open canvas. United by a common purpose, the newly formed Terran Confederation began to paint their picture. &#10;&#10;Expansion led to colonies, research stations, and even more technological discoveries, but it also led to the realization that they were not alone. Although no sentient alien species had been encountered, long range scanners had picked up the distinctive signatures of FTL drives. Sentient races must exist... and they must be space faring. Terran expansion stopped. &#10;&#10;Not knowing what to expect, a period of consolidation followed which emphasized defensive technologies and fleet building. First contact was made by the people of Earth with this unknown race in 2227. Over time, they would eventually call these other-worlders the Talon. It was a shortening of the alien sounds that made up their name but it was also oddly prophetic-the Talon Empire swooped in very much like a raptor upon the fledgling Terran Confederation.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;&#10;Units:  Individual capital ships and fighters&#10;&#10;Time:  Individual fleet battles&#10;&#10;Players:  2 to 6&#10;&#10;Map:  Each hex represents a region of space that normally holds only one ship&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability: there is no hidden information and no simultaneous action&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Talonverse.....&#10;Talon is a game of tactical space combat set in a growing universe with its own history and back story.  This game introduces battles during the First Talon War between the Terran Confederation and the Talon Empire.&#10;&#10;This is a Fleet Combat game.  Battles with individual ships can be fought, but the game easily and quickly simulates combat with fleets of 3-10 ships. These are fleets of Capital Ships.  This is NOT a game about fighter combat in space.  Most ships in the game are large and you must balance your ships' power output between shields, weapons, sensors and maneuverability - you are not just doing an Immelman.  Each faction has unique abilities and each ship has unique features.  Proper strategy involves assessing the different abilities of your ships and the enemy's.&#10;&#10;This is an Accessible game.  The complexity of managing fleets of capital ships has been baked into the game system, leaving the player free to make interesting decisions.  It is also a Fast Paced game.  Small fleet scenarios can be played in one hour, larger ones in under two.  This makes the game thematically rich and full of quick but meaningful choices.&#10;&#10;How can the game do all this?  All a ship's energy use is integrated into something called a Power Curve.  All a player has to do is adjust the speed of the ship.  A ship's speed determines how much Available Power it gets to charge weapons faster, reinforce shields, tighten turns... but there will never be enough of it.  The game is fought on a Map - distances moved, firing arcs, shield arcs are distinct and easily resolved.  The game uses Very Large, Laminated Counters.   All of a ship's systems are displayed directly on the counter and lamination allows you to mark damage and other ship info with a dry erase marker.  All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;&#10;     Terran Fleet (10 different ship classes)&#10;     Talon Fleet (9 different ship classes)&#10;     Ships with 4 Shield Arcs&#10;     Fighter Squadrons&#10;     Bases, Transports&#10;     Unique Abilities for each faction&#10;     Asteroids, Planets, Nebulae&#10;     Black Holes, Worm Holes&#10;     6 Different Weapon Systems including Missiles that track on the board&#10;     NFTL and FTL Drives&#10;     12 Scenarios following the story of the First Talon War&#10;     Mission Variety: Escort missions, planetary invasions, base assaults...&#10;     Lifetime Score tracking &#10;     Empire War campaign game with dynamic, strategic-level decisions&#10;     Point System for Purchasing Ships and Design-Your-Own Scenarios&#10;     A tie in with Space Empires 4x&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Update:From the GMT Talon Reprint page: &quot;Solitaire: - The Talon system plays extremely well solitaire for two reasons:&#10;&#10;1.

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;"

The 16-card deck &ndash; which consists of two loaches (worth 0), four ponds (worth -1 or -2) and ten acorns (worth 1-5) &ndash; is shuffled, then a number of cards equal to the number of players are laid face-up. Each player receives a hand of 3-4 cards.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either places a card from his hand into one of the columns or claims one of the columns. When placing a card, he can lay it face-up (taking one chip from the bank) or face-down (placing one of his chips on the card); when taking a column, it must have at least two cards and at most six.&#10;&#10;After taking a column, the player sums the cards in that column, with a loach turning the negative ponds positive and with two of the acorns worth either 1 or 5 at the player's discretion. If the column's sum is between 0-6, the player takes that many chips from the bank; if more than 6 or less than 0, he pays the difference to the bank. This player is then out of the round, while the others continue to play cards or take columns.&#10;&#10;A round ends when no columns remain, columns with only one card remain, or someone scores 6 chips from a column; in the latter case, the round ends immediately, and no one else scores anything.

Mass and its surrounding areas.&#10;&#10;Players will place their workers at different locations to gain types of resources that will help fight the terrors that will visit Arkham.  You'll collect lore, arcana,  and research resources, in addition to gaining the trust of cultists who will help usher in some of the more advanced terrors to Arkham. You must know your enemy and their plans if you wish to defeat them.&#10;&#10;The game will have a built in time mechanic that will unleash unspeakable terrors on the town unless the players choose to confront it first.&#10;&#10;The eldritch deck will contain 3 levels of terror which will visit the town.  Each time the game is played the deck will vary, as a certain number of cards is added to each of the three levels, changing with the number of players. &#10;Example. There are 18 level 1 terrors, in a typical game there will be only 6 in the level 1 deck. When setting up the game players will randomly choose 6 terrors and shuffle them.  Ensuring that you'll always have a fresh, exciting game as you never know what horrors may come to town.&#10;&#10;Battling an ancient evil one won't always be easy, but will undoubtably increase in difficulty as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;When battle commences, a player will flip the top of the eldritch deck and have to have the corresponding resources to defeat the terror. &#10;Defeating the terrors that confront Arkham will earn you valuable Elder signs (victory points) as well as possibly gaining additional resources.  Encountering these ancient terrible entities won't be easy on your psyche though, defeating or even just encountering these awful creatures can affect your sanity.&#10;&#10;Collect too many insanity cubes and one of your workers will be eliminated from the game and have to check in to Arkham Asylum.&#10;&#10;The game progresses through all three levels of the Eldritch deck, culminating with a final battle with an Elder god.&#10;&#10;When a player defeats the final Elder God in the deck the game ends and Arkham is temporarily safe.  The player who has gained the most Elder Signs will claim victory.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, players will become famous personalities from the Lovecraft Mythos, gaining benefits and even possibly penalties based on the chosen characters.&#10;&#10;I am Providence will be deeply rooted in the Lovecraft Mythos, never straying from the original source material. Many authors have continued the work of HP Lovecraft, expanding his Mythos and building a world of terror. We will focus solely on his writing and works for the base game.  (Though who knows of we'll see a return to Arkham in expansions).&#10;&#10;Artistically, I am Providence will capture the theme and essence of the late 60's and early 70's American International Pictures movie one sheets.  The goal is to present I am Providence as a lost movie title in their series of films that were based on the works of Poe, though their films &quot;The Dunwhich  Horror', 'The Haunted Palace'  and 'Die, Monster, Die' borrowed heavy from Lovecraft.&#10;&#10;"

It has 1 to 4 combatants &quot;Gladiators&quot;, plus Beasts, and Slaves!&#10;The mechanics are slightly similar to Combat in the Lists with a new hex tile game board for the arena, 7 direction movement, new character sheets with abilities, new weapons and armor, beasts; such as lions and bears, slaves &quot;non-trained&quot; combatants, new tactics, and all new images and graphics for cards and components.&#10;&#10;Each Gladiator has nine equipment counter locations on his reference card:&#10;&#10;Head&#10;Left shoulder&#10;Right shoulder&#10;Chest&#10;Groin&#10;Right hand&#10;Left hand&#10;Right leg&#10;Left leg&#10;&#10;These [9] locations can hold [9] different pieces of equipment which can be picked up before the match.&#10;&#10;These new counters make up part of the new mechanics of the game where the equipment and weapons are represented by counters and cards!  The counters fit into specific locations on the player&rsquo;s reference cards and are distributed before the match through a process where each Gladiator takes turns picking a certain number of equipment pieces from an rack.  This process can leave the Gladiators with a mix-match of different types of equipment and weapons but also make for a different game each time its played.&#10;&#10;Each equipment counter is also represented by a Equipment Defense point card, which is used to keep track of the amount of damage a piece of equipment takes during a combat session.  This new system makes up the other part of the new mechanics for Ave Caesar...  Each piece of equipment depending on its type will use up to three different D6 die to help record the amount of damage that piece of equipment can take before it becomes useless. Once the piece of equipment take its max damage allotment, it no longer prevents damage from hitting the player.&#10;&#10;Once equipped, the Gladiators take turns moving, fighting, repositioning, devising tactics and strategies to maneuver into position for the best attack and defense.

Like the first edition of the rules, these rules are set at a squadron level, allowing relatively large battles to be fought on a normal table in 2 to 4 hours. In the 2nd Edition all the separate parts that were in the 1st Edition have been combined and the combat system revised in order that it follows a consistent structure.&#10;&#10;The period covered by the rules has been backdated to ca. 1885, and the data sets available expanded even further than before. The data in the system is compatible throughout so ships from all periods could be matched against each other, though this may not be recommended.&#10;&#10;Ship data is presented in sets for nations and time eras. The data sheets are fully prepared for you, so there is no need to fill out separate sheets. The only proviso is that when using smaller vessels you may have print several copies and the names will have to be entered individually by the player. Ships from cruiser upwards all have individual sheets. All data sheets take account of revisions of armament at various times.&#10;&#10;Time scales are 6 minutes for a game turn, combat is regulated by the use of 5,000 yard range bands, which provide gun penetration values and torpedo hit modifiers. Armour protection is converted to an armour class on specific areas of the ship, taking account of the armour type and date. Damage represents those hits that cause significant damage to the target, and critical hits cause degradation of the combat effectiveness of ships. Command and crew quality are important and ships are commanded and crewed by men of mixed ability, generated using systems which players will recognise from other A&amp;A titles.&#10;&#10;The chance of critical damage is now keyed to the &quot;size of the bang&quot; involved, and the number of guns firing (in the case of ships). More guns means a more chances of causing critical damage, and larger shells/bombs mean a higher chance that critical damage will occur. Higher chances also mean that the damage effects may also be more extensive, because we have expanded the way in which the critical damage system works.&#10;&#10;Play follows a sequence using initiative. The winner of initiative chooses which side will move a squadron first. Movement then alternates between the two sides. During Movement the slowest elements finish their movement first, so the order is all submarines, then all ships, finally all aircraft. The winner of initiative then shoots with a squadron first, and then play alternates. Combat actions ignore the type of element involved.&#10;&#10;Movement takes into account the manoeuvrability of ships of different sizes. Gunnery takes into account the crew skill of the firing ship, interference by shooting from other vessels, the size of the target and the number of guns firing. Hits will cause structural damage and may also cause critical hits, which will degrade the combat effectiveness of the vessel. As ships get more damaged, there is a possible effect on morale, which may cause formations to withdraw to lick their wounds.&#10;&#10;"

It's designed to be easy to learn, affordable to buy, and quick to play, setting it apart from other strategy games.&#10;&#10;There are five different classes of robot: Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel and Support, and dozens of robots in each of those Classes. Each Class has its own way of playing and interacting with other bots, and you can make a team out of any five of them for an infinite amount of possible strategies!&#10;&#10;The main mechanism of the game is teambuilding. Each robot on your team shares energy with each other, so moving and attacking with one will limit what the rest of your team can do during your turn. Certain compatible robots can combine into greater forms, too! If your team is built correctly, you can unite all five of your robots together to form something right out of your favorite giant robot cartoon!&#10;&#10;"

With good planning and some luck on the dice, you'll collect more turtles than anyone else and triumph on this whirlwind island tour.&#10;&#10;During set-up, players arrange the island tiles, then place five or six turtles on various tiles, depending on the number of players. Each player places his character token on the island and takes five color dice.&#10;&#10;In each round, all players simultaneously roll their dice, then arrange them in the order they want to use them. Whoever first completes his planning grabs the sand timer in the center of the board, starting the timer for everyone else to finish their plans. Once time runs out, this player moves his character on the island, moving it to an adjacent space matching the color of the first die in his plan, then moving it again, and so on &ndash; ideally picking up lots of turtles along the way. The other players take turns in clockwise order. A player who lands his character on a corner space can move to either adjacent corner space (as long as he's placed the correct color in his movement chart).&#10;&#10;Players add turtles to the board to bring the total available to five or six, then start a new round. Once all the turtles have been collected, the game ends and the player score for the turtles they've collected: 8 points for a set of six differently-colored turtles, and 1 point for each other turtle. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;"

Why? Why don't they just eat the cheese? That's not the issue here &ndash; let the mice do what they want!&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls eight six-sided dice up to four times, keeping dice between rolls if desired. After finishing, she claims a number card if she's rolled that number on that many dice; e.g., if she's rolled a 4 on four dice, she claims the 4 card. After claiming a card, she either starts a new stack with that card as its base or places that card on top of another card she already has &ndash; but only if that card is lower than the top card of the stack.&#10;&#10;If a player takes a 1 card, she can place it either glass case side up on top of a stack &ndash; closing that stack (since nothing can be placed on a 1) and protecting it from being stolen &ndash; or mouse side up; a mouse side-up 1 can later be placed on a stack, and a player can have only two of these cards. When a player closes a stack with four, five or six cards, she takes a bonus card from the table, with earlier claimed bonus cards being worth more points.&#10;&#10;If a player can't take any cards, she takes a gift card, which she can spend on a later turn to rotate a die to show a particular face. A player can hold only one gift card.&#10;&#10;When three of the number stacks are empty, the game ends immediately. The player with the most stacks claims a 12-point bonus card, then players tally their points. Each closed stack is worth the product of the largest number in the stack and the number of cards in the stack; each open stack is worth the sum of the cards in the stack. The player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"
