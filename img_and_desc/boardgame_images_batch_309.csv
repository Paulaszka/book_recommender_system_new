The game is named after its inventor, the former world chess champion, Jos&eacute; Ra&uacute;l Capablanca.  Capablanca thought that chess would be played out in a few decades, that games between chess grandmasters would always end in a draw. This danger of &quot;draw death&quot; was a main motivation for him to create a more complex and rich version of chess.&#10;&#10;Besides the usual set of chess pieces, each player has additionally two new pieces with corresponding pawns:&#10;Chancellor: a chancellor combines the moves of a Rook or a Knight; Archbishop: an archbishop combines moves of a Bishop and a Knight.&#10;&#10;The new pieces have properties that enrich the game. For example, the archbishop can checkmate a bare king by itself (king in a corner, archbishop placed diagonally with one square in between). Capablanca thought that adding these two powerful pieces would reduce the likelihood of a draw and make the game itself more interesting.&#10;&#10;You can play Capablanca Chess online on Jocly website:&#10;https://www.jocly.com/&#10;&#10;Other Sister Chess variants are: &#10;Bird's Chess, Seirawan Chess, Musketeer Chess, Carrera Chess, Gothic Chess, Janus Chess&#10;http://www.musketeerchess.net/&#10;&#10;"

Modeled closely on historical events, you will confront issues including variable rules of engagement, surveillance and intelligence gathering, submarine warfare, Argentine carrier and surface fleet operations, the Exocet missile threat, third-party operational support and interference, fleet logistics, supply interdiction, and uncooperative weather.  At the same time you will have to walk the tightrope of public opinion, deal with &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; from the politicians back in London, and overcome unforeseen events ranging from the sabotage of supply lines up to orders to take the fight to the mainland.&#10; Will the Falklands remain in British hands, or will the Malvinas return to Argentina?
