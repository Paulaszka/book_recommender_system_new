The player purposefully conducts the affairs of the Russian Empire and its allies, while the game system does the same for the anti-Russian coalition made up of a shifting alliance of powers.&#10;&#10;Central to play of the game are its 'policy cards.' They trigger various strategies, powers at war, and other events that shape the general course of play. Policy cards are activated in one of two ways: the Empire player can choose which policies he will activate, while coalition policies are activated by the draw of markers. The Empire player may move his forces freely. The game system moves coalition forces according to a schedule of precedence.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is for the Russian Empire to have gained an advantageous position at the end of play, measured in terms of gaining certain objectives. The player must, however, also look toward maintaining the &quot;balance of power,&quot; or he may face disintegration of the entire European state system. Depending on how well the player attains his objectives, then, will really be the thing that determines the nature of victory.&#10;&#10;While Catherine the Great has been purpose-designed to be a solitaire game, more than one can play at the same time as part of a Russian Empire command team. Players can divvy up responsibilities as they please for different parts of the Russian Empire, with the most veteran gamer taking the role of Czar and deciding who gets what resources.  Each region represents a distinct geographic area or province within a power. Each unit represents an entire army or fleet. Each turn represents five years.&#10;&#10;"

A hand is won by taking the majority of tricks or by making the opponent(s) fold to a raise. Only ranks of cards are important in Le Truc, not suits. If two cards of the same rank are played in a trick it is &quot;spoiled&quot; and not counted for either side. The first trick of a hand is particularly important, because it acts as a tiebreaker when both sides win an equal number of tricks.&#10;&#10;There is a Brazilian variant know as Truco that also includes a card value to have higher in-game value than others.

Step right up, ladies &amp; gents! Make fantastic medical claims for your bottled elixir. Slander your opponents and steal their secrets! Avoid angry mobs and law enforcement while weaseling the highest price possible for your Snake-Oil!&#10;&#10;3-4 players is ideal, but can be played by 2-8.&#10;&#10;From the rules:&#10;&#10;The Setting: In the latter part of the 19th Century and well into the 20th, an industry boomed across the American Midwest. That industry was the Medicine Show, where any entrepreneur with a questionable recipe and plenty of business savvy could pull his wagon up to the center of town and hawk his medicinal wares for a few cents per bottle. You and your opponents are these peddlers of &ldquo;Snake-Oil&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The Object: In Snake-Oil, the object is to achieve the highest per bottle price for your elixir. To do this, you may have to hire thugs, slander your opponents and plant ringers in the crowd. But it&rsquo;s all in good fun and, hey, you always have the next town for your opponents to get revenge.&#10;&#10;Game Length: A game of Snake-Oil can last is little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour, depending on how many towns you and your opponents decide to hit. Each hand of Snake-Oil constitutes a town. The game includes a score sheet with room for the name of your product and a running tally for three towns. When you&rsquo;ve played the number of hands you&rsquo;ve agreed upon, add up the totals for each town and the winner is the player with the highest total value.&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player is dealt 7 cards face down (if there are more than 4 players, deal 5 cards each). This constitutes his hand at the start of the game. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the table, and the discard pile will go next to it. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left goes first.&#10;&#10;Play: A player must first play a Cure if he has one. This goes directly in front of him in his playing area. He may then play any other card (except for another Cure). If he doesn&rsquo;t have a Cure to play first, he may go directly to playing his second card. [Cards that are not Cures modify the value of the Cures or may cause Cures to be switched or discarded, etc.] He may opt not to play a second card. At the end of the player&rsquo;s turn, he may draw as many cards from the deck as necessary to ensure he ends the turn with 7 cards in his hand. A player may opt to discard his entire hand and draw an equal amount of cards from the deck in lieu of playing any cards on his turn. This simply indicates his wagon has burned down and he&rsquo;s buying new ingredients.&#10;&#10;Ending the Hand: The hand ends when the player who draws the last card from the deck finishes his turn, or when a hand-ending card is played successfully. There are 2 such cards: Rain! and Bust!. There is also a counter (or negating card) for each of them. A player may not end the hand by this method unless he has a value of at least 20&cent; in front of him. Ending a hand by this method does not affect any cards already in play.&#10;&#10;Added Hype: There is a quick table included to randomly determine the name of your product (handy if you&rsquo;re playing a four town Medicine Show). Snake-Oil is fun to play, but it&rsquo;s a lot MORE fun when players start getting into the spirit of the game and hyping their products with zeal. Loosen up, have fun and enjoy your game of Snake-Oil!&#10;&#10;"

The game includes three booklets: Campaign Game, Miniatures Game, and Historical Analysis.&#10;&#10;The Campaign Game is played on a map of the American colonies that is divided into regions. Each region is worth a number of victory points for the British player if they hold it. Holding a region requires a garrison whose size varies by region. For example, Massachussetts Bay requires a garrison of 4000 men; the Mohawk Valley requires a garrison of only 500 men. Regions also provide a number of Loyalists that can be recruited as Provincial units in the British army, Militia who fight as partisans against the British, and a variable number of Continental Army recruits.&#10;&#10;Movement in the campaign is by area (Region). Americans move pretty freely, but the British forces can have some difficulty getting around. This represents the fact that the British found it hard to get their armies where they wanted them when they wanted them (for example, Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne's miserable time in upper New York in 1777). As the British move through areas, they trigger the arrival of loyalists and militia.&#10;&#10;Campaign years are divided into four seasons (turns). The fourth season is winter, which prohibits any British units from moving while allowing American forces to move at a lower rate. However, winter also causes &quot;winter attrition&quot; among American Continental units.&#10;&#10;American forces are created through Continental recruitment and militia (who appear as a result of British being in an area). British forces, except for Provincial units, arrive (and leave) according to their historical schedules. The French may intervene depending on whether the Americans can win a Major Victory.&#10;&#10;Winning the campaign game for the British requires a long, slow haul of hanging on to sufficient regions (which generate victory points) from 1775 to 1783. Americans win the campaign game by winning Major Victories over the British or by holding out and denying the British their victory conditions.&#10;&#10;The rules for the Miniatures Game are pretty standard for 1976, but compare very well to many current rules. The ground scale is 1&quot; equals 15 yards. Time scale is 1 turn equals 15 minutes. Figure scale is variable; regulars are 1:30 while milita and Indians are 1:50.&#10;&#10;The size of the playing area depends on the number of combatants in the campaign battle. The terrain set up for a battle depends on the size of the playing area and the Terrain Factor of the region where the battle is located. The defending player places the terrain in the playing area and the attacking player chooses which edge of the playing area he will deploy on.&#10;&#10;Morale plays a large part in the game. British units tend to be very good, while American units are mostly average to poor. Battles can be a challenge for the Americans, but they can rely on their strengths in skirmishing and shooting--and avoiding British bayonet charges.&#10;&#10;Leaders play a significant role in the game and are specified as Class I and Class II, who are named individuals, and Class III, who represent generic leaders. The rules offer ratings for different historical generals (Benedict Arnold is only rated once as an American).&#10;&#10;Without being difficult, the rules add some nuances that bring out the flavor of 18th century warfare. Shooting is *very deadly* at point blank range (1&quot;), but its effect attenuates dramatically as the range increases. Units that stand to receive a charge roll on a Volley Effectiveness Table to determine the range when they open fire. Poorer units will fire too soon and waste the potential destructiveness of the volley; better units can hold their fire on the attacker until they &quot;see the whites of their eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules like sappers, Indians, Night Attacks, and the &quot;Simcoe/Tarelton Bugle Tactic.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Miller).&#10;&#10;&quot;Verdun: A Dagger at the Heart of France&quot; is an Operational level board-wargame simulation of the 1916 German offensive that was supposed to &quot;bleed the French white&quot; in a single great battle of attrition, but instead turned into a bloody debacle of 10 months of slaughter.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are mostly conventional for hex and counter wargames. Movement, stacking, and Zones of Control are typical of most other games. Combat consists of artillery barrage and infantry assault.&#10;&#10;Artillery can play a big part in the game, as it did historically in the battle. Players are limited in using their artillery by the ammunition factors they must keep track of on the Ammunition Availability Chart. Artillery expends ammunition factors when it fires, which may cause shortages. So, despite a large number of artillery units on both sides, players must use their guns judiciously.&#10;&#10;Assault is done after movement and after artillery bombardment. Attackers must designate their assaults during the movement phase before artillery fire. As a result of artillery fire, both an attacker and defender can be severely affected. Attackers must carry out their assaults regardless of losses from artillery, which can be disastrous.&#10;&#10;Supply rules are typical of many wargames. The rules provide means of destroying the opposing players artillery ammunition stocks and for interdicting rail lines and roads that serve as supply lines.&#10;&#10;The game adds some chrome with German pioneers (who aid in assaults), balloons spotting for artillery, road interdiction (which affects French supply), and gas attacks. There are also rules for the Germans reducing the fortresses that surround Verdun.&#10;&#10;While control of the city of Verdun is a primary victory condition for the game, the real key to victory is the amount of attrition each side does to the other.&#10;&#10;"

Howe moves his forces onto Long Island and uses a long flanking march to get behind the advance American forces, but does not follow up his victory with an assault on the American main line. Fearing a naval trap, Washington retreats his forces to Manhattan.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Harlem Heights (16 Sep 1776). After positioning new lines at the neck of Manhattan, the British move onto Manhattan and take New York City. On 16 September, an American foraging party runs into a British scouting force and a skirmish begins. Both sides begin sending forces into the developing battle. The Americans push the British back two miles nearly reaching the British camps before being stopped. The American morale, flagging after the defeat and retreat from Brooklyn, was restored. Still, the growing British threat to outflank the Americans forced Washington to fall back.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     White Plains (28 Oct 1776) Historically, the battle ended after a lengthy skirmish on Chatterton Hill between a mixed force of British and Hessians versus American militia and regulars. The slow moving British prepared for a battle three days later, but by then Washington had retreated further north to cross the Hudson River and head south to New Jersey. Howe decided not to pursue and instead seized Ft. Washington. However, there are accounts that suggest that Howe might have assaulted the main American line immediately.&#10;&#10;&#10;The New Jersey Campaign :&#10;&#10;&#10;     Trenton (26 Dec 1776) Washington conceives of a bold move to cross the Delaware River and surprise the Hessian outpost in Trenton as a means to gain a victory, and turn the morale of his troops. After crossing the Delaware and marching for several hours in snow and sleet, the force divided into two columns in an effort to surround Trenton, and cut off retreat and reinforcement. The Hessians had no expectation of a surprise attack, and partied late into Christmas night. The American columns managed to emerge almost simultaneously on the few pickets, overwhelming them, and moving in and around Trenton as the Hessians scrambled to defend themselves. In less than two hours, almost the entire 1,400 man garrison was bagged.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Princeton (3 Jan 1777) At the end of 1776, Washington was facing the imminent departure of most of his remaining force. He makes a plea for men to stay on for six more weeks for an additional bounty and was able to pull together 5,000 troops. With these, he crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey again. Sidestepping the British forces marching to Trenton along the main road, the Americans make a back road march towards Princeton. Sending a force to guard a bridge over the main road to slow a British response, this force runs into a trailing British regiment. A battle ensues in a nearby field. The fast marching Americans defeat the British forces, capture supplies at Nassau Court House, and march on to Morristown to winter quarters, but loss General Mercer.&#10;&#10;&#10;Two Bonus Scenarios!&#10;&#10;&#10;     Stony Point (16 Jul 1779) Wayne's surprise attack on the Hudson River fort. The Americans went in with only bayonets and cutting equipment. They managed to capture nearly 500 of the 600 man garrison.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     King's Mountain (7 Oct 1780) The rebel militia avenge their defeat at Camden with a decisive defeat of the Tories, ending Cornwallis' attempt to conquer the Southern colonies until the following year..&#10;&#10;&#10;Components: Two 22 x 34 inch maps, 560 counters, rules book, storage bags and dice.&#10;&#10;The easy game system recreates battlefield conditions with a move-fight-rally play sequence to simulate the grand tactics of these battles.

Many versions of this game have been played by various Celtic peoples for thousands of years and pre-dates the various Viking Tafl-type Games by many centuries. While different rules exist, we have included those that we consider the most challenging and playable for both sides.&#10;&#10;The rules for our version of this game come from studying the &quot;Ballinderry Board&quot;. The Ballinderry Game Board was found in 1932 during the excavation of a &quot;crannog&quot;, or lake dwelling at Ballinderry, West Meath, Ireland.&#10;&#10;Our games are hand-crafted in the Acorn Games studios in the beautiful Monadnock Region of New Hampshire. The game boards are all hand drawn on leather and suede with Ancient Celtic symbols used for the placement marks. Each set also includes 8 jewel toned glass &quot;Robbers&quot; and 4 jewel toned glass &quot;Lords&quot; as well as a hand carved ceramic &quot;King&quot; in a classic terracotta color. Each &quot;King&quot; is highly detailed as you can tell from the picture below.&#10;&#10;The complete rules as well as diagrams for alternate set-ups are permanently attached in the decorated storage box. Each box is hand decorated using a mix of Ancient Celtic designs and wood-burning to make for an attractive conversation piece. Each box measures approximately 4in. long x 3in. wide x 2 1/2in. high. Since each game is hand crafted, there will be natural color and shape variations in the game boards, playing pieces and box decorations.&#10;&#10;Each BRANDUBH Game includes:&#10;1 - Decorated display box with rules&#10;1 - Leather or Suede Game Board&#10;12 - Jewel toned Glass Playing Pieces&#10;1 - Hand-Carved &quot;KING&quot; Piece&#10;&#10;"
