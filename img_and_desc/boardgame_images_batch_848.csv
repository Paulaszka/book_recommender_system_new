With muscle and magic, you'll unearth riches, dig out collapsed tunnels, and carve out great halls as you raise the toppled statues of your ancestors to their places of honor at the heart of the mountain. Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!&#10;&#10;Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.&#10;&#10;A major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources &mdash; gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers &mdash; that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a &quot;pyramid&quot;. The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.&#10;&#10;The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!&#10;&#10;"

The front side shows one design, but the rear shows either a chicken or a llama.&#10;&#10;Generally in a card game, if the card gets scratched, the game is going to collapse, but this game is different. By creasing the bills, you communicate to your partner. However, if the opponents finds out the meaning of your secret crease, the strategy is a failure. Let's make a clever crease that deceives the opponent&rsquo;s eyes and transmits info to your partner.&#10;&#10;Additionally, don't forget that creases accumulate as the game progresses!&#10;&#10;The game is played in partnerships. Each pair of players secretly agree between themselves what marks they will use. One player draws five bills, and marks them to indicate which animal is the minority. The bills are laid out with the animals hidden. The opposing team places chips to show which bills are chickens or llamas. If they get it correct, they score points. If they get it wrong, the first team scores points.

After repeating this a fixed number of times, the settlers arrive and construct buildings.&#10;&#10;Add up the points earned by the constructed buildings and landscapes, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#230;&#139;&#147;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#155;&#163;&#233;&#149;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#230;&#164;&#141;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#156;&#170;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#159;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#230;&#139;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#230;&#139;&#147;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#150;&#139;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#230;&#164;&#141;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#184;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#153;&#175;&#232;&#166;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#232;&#170;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#229;&#128;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#233;&#129;&#184;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#141;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#230;&#164;&#141;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#136;&#176;&#231;&#157;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#232;&#168;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#230;&#153;&#175;&#232;&#166;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Lasers light up the formless void. Galactic Empires clash. A lone hero rises up to fight for the resistance. Welcome to the world of Fistful of Lead: Galactic Heroes!&#10;&#10;In Galactic Heroes, or GH for short, you&rsquo;ll take on the role of a Hero or Villain, leading a scruffy pirate crew looking for adventure, or maybe a troop of faceless soldiers of the Empire in search of bringing order to the galaxy. It&rsquo;s really up to you!&#10;&#10;Galactic Heroes allows you to play a small-scale wargame in the far-flung future, a galaxy, far, far away, a grim, dark future 40,000 years from now, or a certain Red Planet where swords and ray guns reign supreme. Whatever YOU think Sci-Fi looks like, from your favorite Space Opera to gritty Pulp epic.&#10;&#10;Like all the Fistful of Lead games, you&rsquo;ll only need 5 or 6 miniatures per player. You can play 1-on-1 games or larger skirmishes with up to 6 or 8 players. Galactic Heroes can be played with whatever miniatures you already have in your lead pile.&#10;&#10;These rules contain all the information you need to play a game, including rules for building your forces and how to set up the table for different scenarios. Most players will pick up the game mechanics quickly, even people who haven&rsquo;t played a wargame before. The rules can be learned in a couple of turns, and the fast-paced game play keeps everyone engaged. If you&rsquo;ve played Fistful of Lead before, a lot of this will be familiar.&#10;&#10;What separates Galactic Heroes from most tabletop miniature games on the market, is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved. The play is fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair, while record keeping is kept to a minimum.&#10;&#10;The original Fistful of Lead has been around for a decade with a small, but loyal fan base. Galactic Heroes expands the line of western gunfight rules into outer space, because what else is a good sci-fi movie other than a western set in space?&#10;&#10;-description from the Kickstarter page&#10;&#10;"

Over 100 Random variations of combat chits provide a unique experience with each play-through and cut down dramatically on analysis paralysis. Rules are included for multiple interventions, air-power, and UN supply.&#10;&#10;Activations go back and forth with a fixed initiative, creating a unique go-like simulation that recreates the ebbs and flows of the front without railroading players into a foregone conclusion.&#10;&#10;Players each action phase can choose to move, strategic move, conduct a meeting engagement, amphibious invasions, or prepared attacks. The main scenario covers the mobile part of the war and with the combat chits, no 2 games can be alike.&#10;&#10;Players can spend VPs during combat to absorb losses as well as supplies, or deciding to give up ground or rout.&#10;&#10;Players win by driving the VP threshold further towards their side by the end of the game or win automatically by reaching their maximums. Win conditions are based on cities, Pusan Perimeter, and performing historic actions like reaching the Yalu river for the UN or Pusan Perimiter for the Communists.&#10;&#10;No two games of 1950 will ever be alike and plays just as well solo as it does with an opponent.&#10;&#10;Designed by Ray Weiss&#10;Developed by Matt Ward&#10;Box Art by Ivan Caceres&#10;Counter Art by Ray Weiss&#10;Map Art by Ilya Kudriashov&#10;&#10;WEIGHT: 6/10&#10;SOLITAIRE: 8/10&#10;PLAYERS: 1-2&#10;&#10;"

265529,,"Aachoo! is a bluffing game set in the ocean, in the battle between monk fish and its tasty prey. Each player is a monk fish who has 9 mouth locations, arranged in a 3x3 grid.  Players draw tiles, place fish on them either lying or telling the truth, and score more points for having all 3 colors of fish / tiles in a particular horizontal row.&#10;&#10;When a player draws a tile, they examine it and then place it face down on the next open spot in their player's monk fish display. They then place a number of fish of one color on top of the tile. This claim can be either true or a lie. Going around the table, check whether another player wants to challenge the active player's claim. If challenged, the active player reveals the tile. If they were truthful, they keep the tile, but the challenger loses their most recent tile. If caught in a lie, the active player gives the tile and the bluff fish to the challenger, who places them in their next tile slot on their player board. In addition to the normal fish tiles, there are 2 special tiles which change up some of the results of the bluffing.&#10;&#10;Play continues until all but one player has filled up all their slots, or until out of tiles.&#10;&#10;Players score each horizontal row. In each row, they look at the colors of the fish (tokens or fish on tiles).  If all 3 colors are represented, then they score the number of all fish in that row. Otherwise, the row scores the number of tiles.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

265570,,"A contemporary variation on the classic game of Clue (Cluedo) crossed with the Trump-Russia collusion scandals. It is simultaneously humorous political satire and yet an engaging fully playable game with more complexity than the original.&#10;&#10;This card and board game contains many new innovations such as an action-point based system of movement between locations, the requirement that other player-suspects be subpoenaed with an action point (and the ability of other players to resist being moved by subpoena), and the Pardon Power--the ability to pardon the the guilty suspect to alter the game's logic mid-game. The game is played both collaboratively and competitively with other players.&#10;&#10;Each player is a Special Agent on a FBI team investigating clues at potential crime scenes from New York and Washington to London and Moscow. Each player is assigned one of eight suspects to tail around the world, and also has subpoena power to summon one other suspect each turn to a potential crime scene.&#10;&#10;Players use logic to separate out the merely scandalous from the criminally scandalous, and work to bring an indictment against the correct suspect in one scandal at one scene. The indictment must be correct, or the team will lose the game--and the country.&#10;&#10;Ideally, you would like to be the first Special Agent to discover the correct indictment, but any agent on the team can win for the good of the country.&#10;&#10;Remember, the clock is ticking.

And if the investigation drags on too long, then all will truly be lost...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

In search of the philosopher's stone, recipes must be researched and resources mined. The competitive sandbox game combines various mechanics, such as dice rolling while fighting, deck building while recipe exploration, grid movement on a modular game board, pick up and delivery while resource mining, resource management while crafting items and area control by creating little helpers, the Homunculi.&#10;&#10;Materia Prima is a highly immersive game about alchemy and how to create the Philosopher's Stone. Each alchemist must look for long lost recipes and research in old libraries of the cities to create the stone. The elements for this must be mined on hexes, which are distributed on the game board. Alchemy has a centuries-old tradition and its masters come from families, schools and guilds whose history is as old as the records that tell of them. An Alchemist is therefore not a blank sheet of paper. Some have a special alchemical codex, others act out of love or revenge, and there are those who have gone mad by the power of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone and want to plunge the world into chaos. Every single biography results in a secret quest. However, this secret should be guarded, since the competitors will exploit every weakness. The game can only be completed when the first one with the help of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone fulfills this quest.&#10;&#10;The two central game mechanics are a turn and action based move system and a resource based crafting system.&#10;&#10;     The alchemists have a certain number of possible actions (moving, fighting, dismantling, buying, transmuting, etc.) on each turn, depending on the hexes they are currently in. Both the possibilities of action and the number of actions increase in the course of the game, depending on which equipment or homunculi an alchemist transmutes. This immediately leads to the second game mechanic, the crafting system.&#10;     Not only the Philosopher's Stone, but also equipment and homunculi are transmuted with a crafting system. The required elements can be mined on the game board and then improved or transmuted. Meet the enemies heavily armed with sword and shield! Be the wisest and defeat your enemies with the power of alchemy! Be cunning and lead your opponents on the wrong track! Be a strategist and lead your helpers into battle. With the crafting system you turn the game into your game. &#10;&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The game of swashing blades, rivalling schools and swordplay and the bash of combatants in battle. You are the duelling gentlemen, the nobles, the privateers, the henchmen, the thugs and fighters of the streets. Trying to defend your honour, prove your loyalty, do your master&rsquo;s biddings or just to survive. Pick up your sword and roll your dice.&#10;&#10;This is the narrative of duelling. Duelling in the sense of swordmasters, fighting styles, sunset duelling and honour. You are a fighter with a specific style and your school. Combat is both luck and skill.&#10;&#10;Manage your opportunities and movement, and you will come out on top. Whittle down your opponent's stamina in order to score hits, chase your opponent away from the battle, knock your opponent out and win the duel.&#10;&#10; Base concept &#10;&#10;Combatants in a melee or a duel are constantly manoeuvring, in and out of each other's range, accelerating, slowing down, changing directions. Swordplay is like a dance in that you are moving and responding to your opponents, but you also try to outsmart them and to hit them or to keep them far away. The combat, distance, and turn order in this game is an abstraction. There is no fixed amount of time per round or turn, nor a fixed distance between players. The aim of this game is to both be a tool in a narrative and like a game of duelling, you would even be able to play this as a regular board game, player versus player, teams versus teams or in a Battle Royal style.&#10;&#10; Gameplay &#10;&#10;In this game of duelling, your goal is to knock out or chase your opponent away from the battleground. Various stories may drastically change winning conditions and combat is not always the answer. But this time and in this story, it will solely be a story about the duels.&#10;&#10;Once each turn, players will simultaneously roll several six-sided dice and allocate these as the attack, defence and action values. One selected die, and in addition to this, dice combinations will give a final combat value. To aid you during gameplay there will be cards displayed as a playerboard, to visualize and present your decisions, both to yourself and other players.&#10;&#10;Each combatant will have a combat skill level and each skill level will gain you one combat die to roll. The combat skill will range between zero and nine and the most common level is between two and four. In addition to this, there may be bonus dies, and sometimes dice are removed from play or temporarily locked down.&#10;&#10;Independent of how many dice you roll, only ONE of the combat dice is chosen and with its full value be used as the base combat value. The rest of the dice will be used in dice combinations, to either increase this base value or be used for actions. When you choose to perform any one of the various actions instead of, or at the same time as your general melee, dice will be used for action quality instead of as part of the final combat result.&#10;&#10;The combat value is used both as your chance to avoid being struck by ANY opponents and as your chance to land a blow at ONE opponent. These values are compared between players to see who succeeds. The difference between values is the quality of the blow, and are used for fatigue and damage.&#10;&#10;When a combatant is attacked by several opponents, the combatant&rsquo;s combat result will count as the defence value against them all, fully or partially lowering potential damage, regardless of it is a successful or failed onfall against any of the opponents.&#10;&#10;If you are up against and is attacking several potential opponents, you have to declare who is your main target, as you could only have one main opponent each turn. As a combatant is attacking for damage, gets a higher result, and thereby succeeds with the onfall against one, lower this opponent's stamina by the difference between the two results minus any penalty from distance. Turn order and actions may interfere with the attack, distance and protection may change the level of fatigue and damage.&#10;&#10;To be used as fatigue and damage level trackers, there will be three blue health dies placed on your character card. As your combatant gets hit, reduce the value on the health dies one at the time, equal to the quality of the blow. Starting with the topmost die, continuing until the whole value is accounted for. The difference between combat values are the quality of a blow.&#10;&#10;As soon as a die is down to zero you remove it. A removed die will reveal a penalty written on your character card. The values of these health dies will differ between characters and are based on a combatants&rsquo; constitution. Your combattant will be knocked out if all of your three health dice are removed.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every new turn, you reroll all of your available unlocked combat and bonus dice. Change your turn order. You allocate your dice as combat value and dice combinations. Priority of placed dice, onfalls, defences and actions are resolved in an order determined by a cycling sequence of timeslots. These timeslot sequences are determined by fighting styles and timeslot positions range between one to nine. Higher timeslot number is later in the turn.&#10;&#10;Each fighting style sequence does not consist of all available timeslot positions, only a few and it varies between styles. You may voluntarily choose to act later within your own fighting style sequence for a bonus; as recovering stamina or focus and gaining additional combat dice.&#10;&#10;There is no death in this game if you not specifically choose to incorporate this. If you want to tell a more deadly story, you may allow for serious consequences, as permanent injuries, maiming and coup de gr&acirc;ce.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;-Quotes&#10;&#10;Inigo Montoya wrote:&#10;My name is Inigo Montoya.

To begin the game, everyone receives a different card with a starting tile and marks off its spaces on their grid.&#10;&#10;Every turn, two puzzle tile cards are revealed, and each player chooses one of them, then marks off squares on their personal grid that match the shape of the image shown on their chosen card. Multiple players can choose the same card. If a player cannot fit either revealed shape into their grid, they get a second chance and reveal one card from the deck just for them. If they can fit this shape in their grid, they do continue normally next round; otherwise they are eliminated from play.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players have been eliminated, the deck of puzzle cards has run out, or a player has completely filled their grid. If someone has filled their grid, they win. If all players have been eliminated or the deck ran out of cards, then whoever has the fewest empty spaces wins.&#10;&#10;"

It had a devastating impact on Habsburg Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire, which over 120 years earlier partitioned and wiped the Polish&ndash;Lithuanian Commonwealth from the maps. But this global conflict that exhausted the partitioners of Poland gives the opportunity to restore Poland and regain independence. Now, go back to the time of the First World War and join the key statesmen of the era. Responsibility for the existence and the future shape of Poland lies on your shoulders. Only through cooperation may you revive your homeland and protect it from its enemies. Are you brave enough to undertake the mission?&#10;&#10;Niepodleg&#197;&#130;a, which is Polish for &quot;independent&quot;, is a board game published by Poland's Institute of National Remembrance to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the rebirth of Poland. The game illustrates the events that led to the restoration of Poland's sovereignty. This co-operative game played with dice and cards is for 2&ndash;4 players aged 12 or over and has two variants: basic, mostly aimed at education (30 minutes) and advanced for intermediate or experienced players (90 minutes).&#10;&#10;The scope of the gameplay are the events of the years 1910&ndash;1920 with an emphasis on the period between the outbreak of the First World War and the restoration of Poland's sovereignty in 1918. The board represents the former and &mdash; eventually &mdash; future territory of Poland. The players immerse themselves in the operations undertaken by the key characters of the battle for the independence; they try to spread the ideas of independence, seek a national consensus, and strengthen Poland's position in the world. If they fulfill certain conditions, Poland will regain sovereignty in the grand finale in 1918.&#10;&#10;However, despite regaining independence, if the players fail to meet decisive challenges &mdash; the Peace Conference in Paris, the development of a new state administration, the struggle over Poland's borders as well as the uprisings in Greater Poland and Silesia and the Poland-Bolshevik war &mdash; Poland may well cease to exist.&#10;&#10;Niepodleg&#197;&#130;a has 50 wooden pieces (including 19 special dice), 110 beautifully illustrated large playing cards and 24 smaller ones, as well as 88 cardboard pieces, 2 instruction leaflets (for both variants) and a richly illustrated booklet with a historical essay.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
