The Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter, and the Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.&#10;&#10;The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.&#10;&#10;Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level. A chit pull system is used for unit activation, and a step-loss system is used for tracking injuries during skirmishes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players tell stories, compete to best fit card descriptions, and sometimes steal cards from one another, in a bid to get to know each other and win!&#10;&#10;To begin, each player takes one 'Nope' card and two 'Hear Me Out' cards. The deck is then shuffled, placed in the center of the table, and ten 'Take a Chance' cards are placed beside it.&#10;&#10;On your turn you draw a card and follow its instructions. There are four types of cards. The Story Cards are worth two points, while the others are all worth one.&#10;&#10;When you draw a Story Card, you must answer the question on the card, such as 'what was your least favorite job?' or 'who was your arch-nemesis growing up?'. If for some reason you do not wish or do not have a story for the card, you may skip it and draw a new card. Another player may take a skipped card to answer on his turn rather than drawing a new one if he wishes.&#10;&#10;If you are the only one who answered the Story Card, you place it in your score pile. However, a player may discard a 'Hear Me Out' card if she also wishes to tell a story for the prompt. Players then vote on who should win the card. If you have already used your 'Hear Me Out' cards, you may place a 'Take a Chance' card into your score pile instead, in order to answer another player's Story Card. These are worth negative one point.&#10;&#10;The 'Left or Right' cards require you to decide which player on either side of you best fits the description on the card. The 'Point a Finger' card requires everyone to vote on who best fits the description. Finally, for the 'Everybody Answers' card, each player gives a brief answer to the prompt or question and then votes on who wins the card.&#10;&#10;If, during a story, the topic ever veers into territory you are not comfortable with, you simply hold up your Nope Card, and the story immediately ends. There is no penalty and the current player simply draws a new card. Nope Cards are not meant to be used in any competitive fashion, and are simply there to keep everyone comfortable with the game content.&#10;&#10;When a player wins a card they place it in their scoring pile. The first player to 7 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, are YOU ready to lay all your cards on the table?&#10;&#10;The game contains 320 cards and an endless amount of stories to be shared.&#10;&#10;Trying to keep this PG? All our decks are customizable with Rated-R cards that can be removed if your mom wants in on the fun. (Or keep them, your call).&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The cards get passed around, so each player contributes to forming the words. The Ojama is acting a sort of spoiler, secretly trying to make nonsense words as they form. This can produce hilarious words and makes the game a lot of fun.&#10;&#10;Once the words are set, the Respondent tries to identify the theme words that fit each of the composed words.

Should Mongols adapt to an urban culture?&#10;&#10;Each player adheres to one such idea, asks the support of a deity and a totemic animal and begins to gather the assets that will help their idea to prevail.

Players can choose to play an attack card which the attacked player can defend against. The player of the weaker card will lose strength points which will make it harder to fulfill their tasks in phase two. Alternatively, players can pass or try to force a trade on another player. If they know about a card another player holds, they can ask for it in exchange for any other asset card.&#10;&#10;In phase two of the game, players arrive at the great summer festival of Naadam.

At the same time they have to avoid walls, bugs and the dreaded Seepeeu (pronounced CPU).&#10;&#10;Sounds simple, right? But that&rsquo;s the point.&#10;&#10;Children are playing a card game, but at the same time they are creating computer concepts, like algorithms and the sequencing of instructions, and they are learning the invaluable skill of problem solving. And by doing so they are developing a logical mind-set, which is required for coding/programming. By playing Bits &amp; Bytes, children are developing the logical foundations for programming computers, thus when they start to learn actual coding later in life they already have the required mindset. After all, actual coding (programming) is little more than issuing a few instructions to a computer.&#10;&#10;"

Other hits include Irgendwie, irgendwo, irgendwann and ? (Fragezeichen).&#10;&#10;Designed by Suzanne Zinsli (of Cardboard Edison) this is a neat trick taking game where players are trying to reach the end of the cold war track (9 spaces) before the world war track reaches 9, with 9's being trump!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;A standard deck of cars is dealt evenly among the players.&#10;&#10;A token for each player is put at the beginning of the Cold War track, and another token is put in the World War track.&#10;&#10;In each round, every player clockwise takes an action:&#10;- Escalate: play a higher card in the same suit, or any card if you don't have any in suit.&#10;- Stand down: pass until next round.&#10;- Challenge: Play a 9 card (trump, black 9s, and super trump, red 9s).&#10;&#10;Play continues until all but one player passes, or if two same-color 9s are played. The player who played the highest on-suit card (or trump or supertrump) takes all the cards played this round.&#10;&#10;Set aside all 9s played each round. When all four 9s are played, the hand is over. At the end of the hand, discard any cards in your hand, then add up points for the cards you collected by winning rounds.&#10;&#10;If your score was positive, advance your token in the Cold War track. Then, if any player has negative points, take the lowest score and add it to the World War track. If any player reaches the end of the Cold War track, they win. If the World War track reaches its end before any player wins, everyone loses.&#10;&#10;&#10;99 is a postcard game sent to Board Game of the Month Club subscribers in the February 2017 package.&#10;&#10;"
