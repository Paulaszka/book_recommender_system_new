In addition it has 10 land scenarios and 12 naval ones.&#10;&#10;One set of miniatures rules is called Battle Scale (1 figure = 50 men), and the other Small Unit Scale (1 figure = 15 men). The third set of rules covers naval actions.&#10;&#10;Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one &quot;3&quot; card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite. Thus a small, well-led force can run rings around a much larger, poorly-led one. In the land battles actions affect firing, movement and formation changes; in the naval game they affect firing only.&#10;&#10;Quick and fun, as well as being adaptable to other, similar periods.&#10;&#10;"

The cards tell the story of 8 thieves, each story consists of 5 parts. All parts are shuffled. Now, on a turn, a player can take 1 pile and look at the top 3 cards, choosing one of them (he doesn't have to take a card). As soon as someone has all 5 pieces of one story together, he wins the game. The problem is, that you have to take the parts in the right order, you don't know what parts the other players have (the parts 1 &amp; 2 are all three times available, 3 two times, the 4th and 5th part only once), so you have to memorize the right stacks.&#10;&#10;"

The rules are similar to 1830: Railways & Robber Barons on a smaller and terrain-heavy map.&#10;&#10;In 1889, 2-6 players will use money to purchase shares in railroad companies during Share Dealing Rounds. Between subsequent Share Dealing Rounds, railroad corporations then conduct operations on the game board, with the decisions being made by the player who is the major share holder. The game simulates the progression of railroad development during an historic period on Shikoku. Old trains become obsolete while the revenue earnings from cities grows over time. Players will try to purchase the most profitable shares at the right times of the game to maximize earnings in dividends and stock value gains. In the end, the player with the highest value of personal cash and held stocks is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally available in kit form from Wild Heaven, and is now also being published by Grand Trunk Games.&#10;&#10;"

Players are required to state the color of marble to be introduced into Mr Mad's mouth prior to doing so.&#10;&#10;On the floor of his transparent mouth is a button; if a marble hits this button the mechanism inside Mr Mad is triggered, causing him to spin around, flinging the marbles in his mouth out through large gaps where his hands would otherwise be.
