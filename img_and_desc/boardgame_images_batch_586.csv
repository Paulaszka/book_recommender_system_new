They are charged with gathering ore from the mines, purchasing weapon designs from the market and then using these resources to forge weapons for adventurers who will go on quests to fight back the ever-deepening darkness. If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire.&#10;&#10;At its core, Forge War is a rewarding game of aggressive investment, which occurs through the acquisition of quests. Quest management becomes challenging for the player, however, because quests undertaken aren't completed immediately, but instead progress each turn and become more difficult. At specific time intervals, players will need to add more resources to their quests or face failure.&#10;&#10;Gameplay cycles through three different phases in each round. The first phase consists of moving pieces around a hex grid to maximize resource production. The second phase is a market phase that features an action blocking mechanic to gain access to new weapon plans and other advantages. The final phase is the acquisition and management of quests, which are selected from a pool of available cards.&#10;&#10;"

The first one to pillage all of the villages and take the daughters of their thanes to his home port as warranty of recognition of jarls authority will be declared the winner. To do this, the jarls will have to brave the stormy northern seas, battling each other along the way, and watch out for the sea monster that lurks beneath the waves! The most cunning and vehement of them all &ndash; that is, the one who the Gods favor &ndash; will throw a great feast and become the Konung of the North.&#10;&#10;Vikings: Warriors of the North is a card-based game. Players draw cards from a common deck. Wind cards are used for moving a drakkar around the board that depicts the cold north sea. Players can move the drakkar to a village (to sack it), to an enemy drakkar (to attack it), or to their own ports, where they can throw a feast for the Gods.&#10;&#10;A player can also use cards to drastically change the gameplay: He can increase his chances in an attack, re-roll the dice, sail further with his drakkar, or steal cards from an enemy's hand. All of those cards represent story events that have tangible effects within the game. Some cards represent heroes who can become part of a drakkar's crew. As long as a hero stays on the ship, he grants his owner a permanent effect. Each drakkar has three open slots for heroes. Daughters of the thanes are also considered heroes, so they also occupy drakkar slots. With only three slots, players have to think hard about their crew composition.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can play any number of cards from his hand and take one action: attack, sack a village, throw a feast, etc. Attacks are resolved by a roll of a six-sided (d6) die, although many cards influence the combat result, so each battle is exciting.&#10;&#10;When a player take three daughters of the thanes (each of a different, opposing player color) and brings them to his own port, the game is over and that player wins. The gameplay is fast, furious and fun, full of twists and comebacks; it really lets you feel like a Viking chieftain!&#10;&#10;"

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.&#10;&#10;In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.&#10;&#10;The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.&#10;&#10;"

It is, in fact, one of the most flexible, innovative, and fast-paced miniatures rule systems for use with fantasy miniatures and models ever created.

Little Orc Wars focuses on fantasy and the basic rules for moving troops, melee, ranged combat, terrain effects, etc.--although modern rules are more complex, these rules capture the feel of combat with very little effort or time.&#10;&#10;"

If you&rsquo;re  just tuning in, my name is Johnny Atom-Bomb, your humble host broadcasting live from Old Line Radio, the Tri-State Wasteland&rsquo;s only radio station, excepting derelict government civil defense broadcasts or other dubious transmissions. The wasteland may not look like much, but she&rsquo;s all we got, and I&rsquo;m here to help you see another sunset.  So load your gun, turn up that dial, and stay tuned.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&mdash;Old Line Radio Opening Sign-on Announcement&#10;&#10;The rules of TNT could be used for any post-apocalyptic world, but the official setting begins in the heart of the Tri-State Wasteland, a part of the old Mid-Atlantic States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.  &#10;The core rules include, from website &quot;This is Not a Test uses 10-sided dice, referred to as D10 in the rules, and occasionally standard six-sided dice, labeled D6.&#10;&#10;Two types of dice roll mechanics resolve all actions: Opposed and Stat tests.&#10;&#10;Opposed tests are used for resolving direct actions between figures, mainly close combat. Both players roll a D10 and add the appropriate stat and any applicable modifiers. The highest score wins. Ties always go to the defender.&#10;&#10;Stat tests are used when a figure is trying to accomplish an action, usually something unopposed by an enemy model.  Examples include opening a locked door or climbing a ledge. The player rolls a D10, adds the relevant stat and any applicable modifiers, and checks to see if he rolled equal to or higher than the required Target Number (TN).  The TN is specified by the type of action, as are the results of success or failure. Unless otherwise specified, all stat tests have a TN of 10. Specific types of tests are discussed further under stats.&#10;&#10;Additionally, several dice conventions are used.&#10;&#10;Critical Hit: A natural roll of 10 on the D10 indicates a lucky bonus.  Should a Critical be scored the player may roll a D6 and add the result to their original D10 roll.&#10;&#10;Fumble: A natural roll of 1 is always bad, but does not result in any penalties.  However, 1s cause additional problems, such as weapon failure or ammo depletion, which are described later in the relevant sections.&#10;&#10;D3 &ndash; Some rules require the roll of a D3.  To get a result roll a D6, where a score of 1 to 2 = 1, 3 to 4 = 2, and 5 to 6 = 3. Rolling a D3 never results in a Critical or Fumble.&#10;&#10;Scatter &ndash; Scattering means to determine a random direction, usually to represent a misplaced grenade or errant entity.  To determine this direction simply roll a scatter die, or if that is unavailable, roll D10 and use the direction the top of the die is pointing, or some other agreed upon method.&#10;&#10;Rerolling Dice &ndash; Some abilities allow players the opportunity to reroll their dice in the event they are unhappy with the first result.  The second result cannot be rerolled even if it is worse.  You may not reroll a reroll!&quot;&#10;&#10;The game will offer random encounters to give the play a different feel.&#10;&#10;&quot;In This Is Not a Test your warband&rsquo;s problems don&rsquo;t just start with your opponent, the wasteland itself can be just as danger.  TNT offers rules for both hazards of wastes as well as a bestiary of wasteland denizens.   At the beginning of each battle, players roll to determine if any hazards are present.  There roughly a 50% chance something bad will occur.  The point was to offer something a little different without over burdening the players with too much going on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hazards are natural, and unnatural, phenomena that pervade the wasteland.   Earthquake, ash storms, unexploded ordinance and other dangerous events.  Below are just two examples taken directly  from TNT.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

But at the end of the game the player with most fries wins points.&#10;When the ending condition is meet, the burger is over and everyone compares the resulting burger with their orders and count points for the objectives they accomplished.

Each player starts the game with four banks and four vaults in the colors red, green, blue and yellow. All the players also have a personal vault where they can save their precious cards.&#10;&#10;The game is played with two types of cards: point cards and Banco cards. The point cards have a color, value and 1-3 symbols. These cards are used to score points or to invest in the banks. The Banco cards, which have a color and a bonus, are used only to close a bank. A player's turn has three phases. First, the active player can steal a card from an opponent by asking for it (color, value or a combination of both). Second, the player takes two actions, which can be playing cards on a bank and/or vault, saving cards in the personal vault, taking your personal vault to your hand, or burning cards. Finally, the player brings his hand back to five cards.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in the vaults and secure these points by closing the banks. When a bank is closed, all players must close their vault of the same color, so no points can be scored anymore. When all vaults are closed, the game ends and points are counted.&#10;&#10;"

The dice is then thrown to decide which player is to start; other players follow in a clock&not;wise direction. In their turn players throw the dice and move their pawn the number of spaces indicated by the dice. Moves may be made backwards or forwards around or across the diagonal paths. If the &lsquo;pawn&rsquo; lands on a letter, the player takes a matching letter from the letter tiles. Should the pawn land on a Gold Star he may take any letter he wishes; but if the pawn lands on a Black Spot the player must return a vowel card from those he has won back to the general pile; if he has not yet gained a vowel, he must owe it and return it when he obtains one.&#10;The object of the game is to form words from the tiles collected. For the younger child it can be to make simple three letter words such as CAT&mdash;MAT&mdash;COT&mdash;CUP and so on. It should be decided beforehand the number of words (say six) and the first to do so being the winner.&#10;&#10;It is also a game which may be played with enjoyment by much older children. In this case a point value is given to the length of the word. 3 letter words, 5 points; 4 letter words, 10 points; 5 letter words, 15 points; 6 and over letter words, 20 points. In this case it must be decided beforehand the number of points to be played for (say 100); the first player to do so being the winner. Words already formed may be added to such as MAT to MATS or MATCH; but no word already laid may be re-arranged.&#10;&#10;"

Your goal is to find the city of New Eden before others players.&#10;&#10;Each player will play a character with 8 characteristics: fighting, shooting, driving, chating and having mechanical, medical, discretion and foraging abilities.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players choose one of the 5 possible destinations. On his way to the chosen destination, each player will make an encounter and most of the time a fight will result. But all encounters are not the same. Depending on your opponent you'll try to run away, to pay what he wants or to use one of your 8 characteristics to fight him. If you own a car you also can try to accelerate to evade. Your characteristic plus some items and a dice will decide if you succeed or not.&#10;&#10;Depending on the place you've chosen different actions are possible: trying to hide to recover, collecting items, selling or buying items, fighting with other players or exchanging items in between players. Items are in your hand. You may use most of them but some have a cost you must pay to use them.&#10;&#10;But in this post apocalyptic survival is not easy. Each turn you must eat and drink.  You can get wounded or contract diseases that players with good medical abilities can heal or cure. Players can also improve weapons, vehicles or armors using their technical abilities.&#10;&#10;The first player to arrive at New Eden, one of the 5 destinations, wins. But the road to new Eden is more challenging: you'll face 5 encounters on your way. And before entering New Eden you must be free of any disease.&#10;&#10;Two additional scenari are available, one with a mission to be accomplished before trying the road to New Eden, and one for a single player.&#10;&#10;"
