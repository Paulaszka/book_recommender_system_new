Seen as the last steppingstone for the final jump toward Japan, the battle was important for both sides. The US had to prove it could overcome enemy resistance, securing airfields, and, after the bloodbath on Iwo Jima, keeping their casualties low. The Japanese had the chance to test their new air tactics relying on simultaneous strikes from multiple groups of Kamikaze and conventional strike aircraft escorted by fighters. They also had a full Army on the island backed, with one of the highest concentrations of Japanese artillery even seen during the Pacific War. They had to hold part of the island or inflict a level of casualties on US forces to cast enough doubts on their ability to later sustain a larger operation on Kyushu and then Honshu.  Stakes were high on both sides.&#10;&#10;The game covers the land battle for possession of Okinawa (focusing on the more military relevant southern part), and the concomitant air and naval struggle around it. On land you have Marine and Army regiments, tanks and amphibious tanks, Japanese forces that run the gamut between highly experienced machine gun battalions to raw conscripts.  At sea Carriers, battleships, Navy and Marine air groups, Japanese Kamikazes, and even Yamato&rsquo;s last sorties. Even the Commonwealth makes an appearance with Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet.&#10;&#10;In addition to the campaign, shorter scenarios are included as introductions to the game system, as well as highlighting critical moments of the epic struggle.

Brettspiel retains the central element of the 6 nimmt! card game: Each player reveals a card from their hand at the same time, then the cards are added to a central display with players possibly being penalized should their card end up in the wrong location.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes tiles numbered 1-100, and each player receives a hand of twelve tiles. Four tiles are revealed at random and placed in the first position of the first four rows on the game board. On a turn, each player chooses a tile, then reveals them all at the same time, with the tiles being added to the game board from lowest number to highest. A tile is placed in a row to the right of a tile with a lower value, with the smallest difference between tiles mattering should multiple options be available. (For example, a 16 would be placed to the right of 14 and not 7 should both of those numbers be present in different rows.) If a tile is lower than all rightmost tiles, then you place it to the right of the tile with the highest value.&#10;&#10;If the tile is placed on a space with a positive or negative bullhead symbol, the player gains or loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their played tile. If the tile fills the final spot in a row, then the player loses points equal to the sum of bullheads on all other cards in this row, then this card is moved down the game board to the first position in the highest empty row.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has played all of their tiles &mdash; or in a two- or three-player game, refilled their hand, then played through a second set of twelve tiles &mdash; the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;If you like, you can play 6 nimmt! Brettspiel with &quot;good luck cards&quot;. Whenever you score negative points, you draw such a card from the deck. These cards either convert a non-final row space on the game board to +5 points (instead of whatever it was) or convert a final row space to a bonus that might end up netting you points instead of losing them.&#10;&#10;On the back of the 6 nimmt! Brettspiel game board is a second board to be used with the &quot;professional version&quot; of the game. In addition to the &plusmn;bullhead spaces, this board has spaces that force you to draw a new tile, claim all the tiles in a row (instead of scoring negative points), or draw an action card. These action cards let you play anywhere, swap your played tile for another from your hand, skip to the front line, and more. This version can be played with or without the &quot;good luck cards&quot;. When one player is out of tiles, players lose points for the bullheads on tiles still in hand.&#10;&#10;"

Through strategic placement of your pawns, sometimes blocking other players or bumping them to adjacent locations, you collect the resources and body parts needed to bring your monster to life.  Once alive, your monster is an additional worker which you may place to gain resources or sacrifice on a rampage through the village to score additional victory points.

The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;This first volume is District Commander Maracas. It takes as its subject counterinsurgency operations in a megacity - the urban battlefield of the future, and the cutting edge of modern doctrine. The sudden departure from power of Jesus Shaves, charismatic leader of Virtualia, has created a power vacuum in the streets of Maracas, capital city with a population of over 3 million people. The Virtualian Liberation Movement is exploiting this situation by organizing areas of the city against established authority, sabotaging civic services, and staging attacks on symbolic objective points. The local security force commander must contend with not only the urban guerrillas of the VLM but also private neighborhood armies and criminal gangs running amuck.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

It includes sixty challenge cards and sixteen insect tokens, four each of four types. To complete a challenge, you lay out the insects as shown on the challenge card, then place the chameleon token adjacent to one edge of the grid. A move consists of eating (i.e., flipping face down) all the insects of one type in the row/column next to the chameleon, then advancing the chameleon clockwise around the perimeter as many spaces as the number of insects you just ate. If you land on a row/column with no uneaten insects &mdash; yet insects remain elsewhere in the layout &mdash; then you've lost the challenge; if you eat all the insects, you win.&#10;&#10;Kameleo can also be played as a two-player game. Lay out the insects on a challenge card, then the first player chooses where to place the chameleon token. Players take turns eating a type of insect and moving the chameleon. Whoever can't eat on their turn loses the round, and whoever first loses three rounds loses the game.&#10;&#10;"
