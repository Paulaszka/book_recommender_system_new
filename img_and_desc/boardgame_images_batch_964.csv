We wanted to produce something different than a standard tuck box of suited cards and also steer away from the classic 'trumps' format - although good for sports stats, there isn't much variety and this needed to be more original.&#10;&#10;In short, you try and build your best 5-a-side team from a deck of current and classic players and score goals/points by having the team that totals the most stars at 'Kick-off'. More on mechanic and rules below.&#10;&#10;Gameplay summary:&#10;You are dealt 5 cards each&#10;players take turns to draw a player card, then a referee card&#10;the aim is to build a legitimate formation of GK DF MF MF ST, at that point you can initiate a Kick-Off, where all players&#10;lay their cards down and the player with the most stars total scores a goal, first to 5 goals wins.

Deploy your warships to the battle coordinates, assign your available reinforcements, and deal with the anomalies that can occur in the depths of space. Winners go on to fight in future encounters, while the losers are blown to oblivion. Through a series of skirmishes, each space force will be reduced to their most powerful fleets, and will finally meet in a glorious battle for supremacy in the galaxy!&#10;&#10;"

These cards are combined into small decks in a manner that uses randomization and fixed elements to form an Encounter. The same Encounter can play out differently each time it is played because of the randomization of the cards, forcing the player to think on their feet and adapt to changing circumstances. This also makes each scenario highly replayable.&#10;&#10;Unlike most games that use a board with spaces or miniatures on a playing surface, in Split Second the playing area is abstracted using cards to represent the battlefield. &#10;Ranges aren't measured in physical distance, but instead cards are placed into Areas that are split up by Area Divider cards. &#10;Movement between objects isn't made in any linear measurement, but in movement points as the combatants anchor themselves to and then move away from objects in the battlezone.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

During the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, this swampland was slowly changed into farmland under the aegis of pharaohs such as Amenemhet III and Sesostris II. They ordered their advisors to build a system of canals and dikes to reclaim the land surrounded by desert and inhabited by crocodiles to turn it into a granary for Egypt.&#10;&#10;Now, during the reign of Amenemhet III, you are the pharaoh's advisors, commanded to harvest goods, build roads, found settlements, and do much more for the good of Faiyum! You are being supplied with the necessary manpower, resources, and money, which means that if another advisor needs to use &quot;your&quot; roads, farms, and other buildings, they may do so since everything you build is owned by the pharaoh. The only thing you will own is the only thing that matters: the respect of the pharaoh.&#10;&#10;Faiyum is a strategic game for enthusiasts of planning games. The basic rules are simple: Play your cards one by one on your personal discard stack. After playing some or all of your cards, you take them back into your hand in &quot;reverse&quot; playing order, so playing cards in the best order is important. Newly purchased cards go directly into your hand, so the timing of getting and playing them is important, too. Each of the individual cards has easy-to-understand actions, but only by creating the best combined &quot;engine&quot; will you be a master advisor of Faiyum.&#10;&#10;This game features a card mechanism reminiscent of deck builders and the market mechanism successfully used in Power Grid. Gain more and more valuable cards, and use the structures built on the game board to your advantage &mdash; in other words, for your reputation. In the end, the most cunning advisor who creates the best card combinations will win Faiyum.&#10;&#10;"

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are occupied by workers.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;"

There are Genre, Script, Director, Actor, Staff, Prop, and Location cards. You need a Genre or Script card, a Director, one or more Actors, and one or more Staff to complete a film, which you can then release by closing it off with a special Release card.&#10;&#10;The players have their own decks of cards. On your turn, after taking one card from your deck, you may buy 1 or 2 additional cards from any deck or discard pile and then, if you want, play 1 or 2 cards from your hand. At the end of each turn, you then receive box office money earned by your released films and pay the ongoing costs of your open productions. In case of need, you may borrow money that you will have to return with interest at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Instead of adding cards to your productions, you can discard them to get instant cash or to interfere with other players&rsquo; productions. The game ends when a player releases a pre-determined number of films.

It features an all-new battle, complete with its own map and countersheet.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Kelja (December 25-27, 1939) now compliments the original Tolvaj&auml;rvi battle. Kelja presents a challenge that is unique to the game system but certainly not the Winter War: a large-scale river crossing. The length of the new map is bisected by a wide, frozen river that functions as a frozen lake.&#10;&#10;Kelja is a logical fit for the game system in terms of length and scale. At three days, it provides a shorter play experience than the five-day Tolvaj&auml;rvi battle. The unit density is only moderately higher than that of the previous battle but still limited to a single countersheet, and the featured river crossing offers a unique game situation, providing both players with plenty of decisions and challenges.&#10;&#10;Lest the battle become a &ldquo;one trick pony,&rdquo; plenty of options are available to both players, including variable unit setups, multiple victory conditions, variable reinforcement units, and smaller scenarios including some hypothetical situations.&#10;&#10;Mechanics&#10;&#10;Central to play is the Action Phase, wherein each unit may choose only one from several possible actions: move/assault, attempt recovery, dig in, or take replacement steps. This makes for some very tense decisions for both players. It also conveniently moves the game along at a brisk pace.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast and well integrated. Units may voluntarily perform combats against adjacent enemies (two-way firefights, which utilize a CRT), conduct assaults as part of movement, or make ranged attacks at a distance of two or more hexes. The &ldquo;grand tactical&rdquo; scale of 425 yards per hex yields ranges of 2 hexes for light machineguns, 3 hexes for heavy machineguns and T-26 tanks, 6 hexes for medium mortars, and 12 hexes for heavy mortars. Artillery is somewhat abstracted, being handled as off-map batteries which can strike any hex on the map. Players allocate barrages as they see fit, while keeping an eye on their ammunition.&#10;&#10;The rules for night turns provide several layers of strategic depth by means of individually simple mechanics. During each night turn, which simulates a 12 hour period, units have double their normal movement allowances. This means combat units can exploit gaps in the enemy&rsquo;s frontline, cross lakes, or execute wide flanking maneuvers. However, such ambitious units are susceptible to &ldquo;Sub-Zero&rdquo; step losses, simulating frostbite, desertion, and poor morale from the extreme weather conditions. Whether or not each stack (note: stack, not individual unit) receives a step loss is determined by a simple 50-50 die roll. The interaction of these night rules means that ambitious players may be encouraged to push their luck and gain the upper hand during night turns, all while the system simultaneously encourages players to &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; and even huddle their units together into stacks during night turns to reduce total step losses. The end result is that the system nicely mirrors the night actions of the actual battle.&#10;&#10;The implications of the night rules don&rsquo;t stop there. Skilled players will plan ahead for a night turn by positioning their units favorably during the preceding dusk turn, so they won&rsquo;t need to relocate and possibly take step losses. This nuance can (and should be) exploited by the Finns, who move second in the turn sequence. The Soviet player has the option to build bonfires to avoid sub-zero attrition losses, but in doing so his units become very inviting targets for Finnish assaults. All this gives both players a lot of choices, without burdening them with cumbersome rules or tables.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You and your fellow art students vie for top marks with professors while trying to put your own spin on each assignment. The twist? Art school really broke the bank, so you must share a canvas with your rival classmates!&#10;&#10;Abstract Academy is played over three rounds by either two or four players, with the players completing a new canvas each round. At the start of the game, you lay out 2-3 scoring cards for each round, so you all know what you're trying to achieve to score. Additionally, at the start of each round, each player receives an inspiration card that shows a pattern they're trying to create on the canvas.&#10;&#10;In the two-player game, players take turns playing canvas cards into a shared 4x4 play area, and in the four-player game, they play in a shared 5x5 area. Canvas cards are divided into quadrants, and each quadrant is colored yellow, red, or blue. The canvas grows organically as you all play cards, and the edges aren't fixed until you have four (or five) cards in a row or column. The edge of the canvas closest to you is your home row, and once the canvas is locked in size, no one else can play in your home row (unless all other spaces are filled).&#10;&#10;Once the canvas is filled, the two rows closest to you form your scoring zone. If the color patterns in your zone complete a scoring card better than the patterns in anyone else's zone, then you claim the scoring card. Additionally, if you've created the right pattern in your scoring zone, you can score your inspiration card. Whoever has the most points after three rounds is the star pupil of Abstract Academy and wins!&#10;&#10;Admin note: The logo of Flatout Games is shown on the English-language edition of Abstract Academy, but Flatout Games is not involved with the publication of this game.&#10;&#10;"
