In the game, players take the role of explorers competing for the title of the most skilled nature observer. To win, they collect cards with the most valuable species, landscapes, and discoveries. Their journey is led by passion, a curiosity of the world, an inquiring mind, and a desire to discover the mysteries of nature. The competition continues at the bonfire where the players race to fulfill the goals of their adventures.&#10;&#10;In this medium-weight board game for 1-4 players, you take turns placing path tokens on one of the two boards. Placing a token on the main board allows the player to get cards, but playing them requires meeting certain requirements. Playing a token on the bonfire board activates special actions (which helps to implement a chosen strategy) and gives the opportunity to achieve goals that provide additional points. Throughout the game, players collect cards in their meadow and surroundings area. At the end, the player with the most points on cards and on the bonfire board wins.&#10;&#10;Meadow also includes envelopes with additional cards to open at specific moments...&#10;&#10;"

Can you put the pages together in the best order possible? And are you prepared to sacrifice a species to develop your manuscript?&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a single card on the table, a card that shows some combination of the four possible resources in the middle of the card, in the corners of the card, or both. Players also have two resource cards and one gold card in hand, while two of each type of card are visible on the table.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you place a card from your hand overlapping the corners of one or more cards you already have in play. Your starting card has four overlappable corners, while resource and gold cards have only three.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Resource cards have no cost to be played, and they often depict resource symbols in their corners.&#10;    Gold cards deliver points when played, but they often have a resource requirement, e.g., three fungi or two plant/one animal/one insect, and you must have those resources visible in your manuscript at the time you play the gold card. You score points from this card immediately, with some cards having a fixed value and others a variable one depending on how many of a certain symbol are showing or how many corners you covered this turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you wish, you can play a card from your hand face down; such a card has four corners and one resource, but provides no points.

Instead, the highest card wins the trick, which leads to often unpredictable victories because the six special cards have different skills.&#10;&#10;To win the game, teams have to estimate the risk of stating the expected tricks, use the special cards cleverly, and harmonize as an unit without either of them knowing what the other person holds.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

As they learn the game's basic maneuver and combat systems, they will then layer on more advanced systems for Strategic bombing, submarine attacks on merchant shipping, search and detection, amphibious assaults, and extensive Operations driven by their command decisions.&#10;&#10;Pacific War is also a time machine back to the halcyon days of the monster game. However, despite what you may have heard, Pacific War is NOT a monster game, but rather an operational World War II air-land-sea game system that lets you fight EVERY Pacific battle and campaign of significance. The original game came with 21 scenarios. This new edition will add at least half a dozen more. The game gains its monster game reputation from the fact that in order to fight all of these campaigns, you need a large number of counters (over 2000) that represent individual capital ships, cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons, aircraft groups, and land units ranging from battalions to divisions to corps, with all units individually rated based on their historic performance.&#10;&#10;The game map is an equal area map (two mounted maps) which is the grandfather of the Empire of the Sun map. Each hex is 100 miles and covers the entire Pacific from Hawaii to India and Alaska to Australia. The game will also come with a separate map focused on the Solomon Islands where many of the interesting and balanced scenarios occur. What made Victory Games' Pacific War unique in 1985 remains true in GMT&rsquo;s 2020 edition. The design integrates strategic/operational intelligence into a telescoping time mechanic that allows campaigns to progress in a logical asymmetric flow, accompanied by tense game play. Pacific War is a deep historical simulation, so if this is not what you are looking for in a new purchase, please read no further. So, how is this level of simulation achieved?&#10;&#10;During each monthly turn you bid command points (logistics) to determine initiative (offensive player), with the high bid then activating and launching their forces toward their objectives. Secretly,  your opponent (reaction player) determines the operational intelligence level and their potential to intercept the offensive. As the offensive develops, it comes within range of enemy air and submarine forces that tactically attempt to detect the oncoming attack. The reaction player decides how to defeat the attack based on the intersection of tactical and operational intelligence coupled with available forces and logistics.&#10;&#10;This entire sequence is set within a telescoping time scale (days to hours) that has naval units seamlessly accelerate (from 12 to 30+ knots), searches seek out the enemy, carriers launch air strikes, combat air patrols defend, culminating with torpedo and dive bomber attacks on individual naval targets. At its core, Pacific War&rsquo;s game systems allows you to fight detailed carrier strikes (sequential and simultaneous) with night surface naval actions (float planes, gunfire and torpedo salvos) integrated with large scale ground offensives on the Asian mainland (e.g., Malaya, Burma, and China) and of course amphibious invasions (e.g., Java, Guadalcanal, and Leyte). If you are looking for a detailed and interactive operational simulation of the War in the Pacific, this is the game for you!&#10;&#10;So, what will change in the new version? The structure and feel of the design will be unchanged, so if you played it in your youth, you already know how to play. That said, a devoted number of players have been playing this game for 35 years and I have incorporated the best of their feedback into this new and final edition for this title. I am going over each scenario and updating them with information that I did not have available back in 1985. For example, I now have several Japanese translations of their official records that were only published in the last few years. Toward this end, I am adding at least six new campaign and strategic scenarios, so you can experience the entire panorama of the war in a long afternoon .&#10;&#10;The key question that I consider when buying a new game is will it hit the table? The owners and reviewers who created the game's reputation were excited that Pacific War had a layered set of scenarios that incorporated fifteen-minute solitaire learning engagements, two hour battles (such as Coral Sea and Santa Cruz that were used in a decade of tournaments), two to eight hour Campaigns (such as Malaya, Guadalcanal and Breaking the Bismarck barrier), and of course the Strategic scenarios that cover the entire war from a single year to the entire war. Will you ever play the entire war? It's unlikely (to date I have only done it three times). However, Pacific War is an operational level game and the Campaign scenarios are the heart and soul of this game system. Most play in an afternoon to completion. So, will it hit the table? Only you can answer that question, but from a time and learning perspective this game will support any time commitment you wish to make, to include the 100+ hour Strategic Scenario.&#10;&#10;The other question that was not asked back in 1985, but to many is important in 2020 is &quot;does Pacific War have a solitaire &lsquo;Bot system?&quot; The answer is no, with an explanation. The only game decision that cannot reasonably be made is the Operations bidding mechanic and the original game included a solitaire bidding mechanic which will be retained. I will look to see if there are any other similar decisions, such as surface action range bids that I have already added. Thereafter, you will need to play both sides. Due to the history and the game system you will likely not notice as you experience the war&rsquo;s narrative unfold before you. So, although Pacific War will not have a &lsquo;Bot (not even sure how to do that with over 25 scenarios), the game will handle all the interactive bids decisions. If you want a full-blown solitaire opponent, this is not the game for you.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher's website&#10;&#10;GAME CONTENTS AS RECEIVED:&#10;&#10;    2 Mounted Maps (22&quot;x 34&quot; each)&#10;    1 Paper map (17&quot;x 22&quot;), subset of mounted maps&#10;    10 coutersheets&#10;        2 sheets of 9/16&quot; counters, 384 total including 14 blanks - ships&#10;        8 sheets of 1/2&quot; counters, 2240 total including 12 blanks - everything else&#10;    &#10;    5 booklets&#10;        1 Core Rules Booklet, 68 pages, with index&#10;        1 Engagement Scenario Rules Booklet, 40 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index&#10;        1 Battle Scenario Rules Booklet, 44 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index&#10;        1 Scenario Booklet, with 34 scenarios - 8 engagement, 12 battle, 9 campaign, and 5 strategic scenarios, 72 pages&#10;        1 Battle of the Coral Sea (Extended Example of Play) Booklet, 16 pages&#10;    &#10;    13 displays&#10;        1 Operation Display (8.5&quot; x 22&quot;)&#10;        1 Allied Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        1 Allied Force/Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        2 Allied Force Displays (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; each)&#10;        1 Allied Screen (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;        1 Allied Player Display (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;        1 Japanese Force/Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        2 Japanese Force Displays (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; each)&#10;        1 Japanese Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)&#10;        1 Japanese Screen (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;        1 Japanese Player Display (11&quot; x 34&quot;)&#10;    &#10;    1 Pad of Replacement Record Sheets&#10;    2 Ten Sided Dice (one orange, one blue)&#10;&#10;&#10;(all Booklets and Displays in Color)&#10;&#10;"

It challenges players to build combinations of abilities, as well as to correctly calculate the advantage of delayed gratification for actions.&#10;&#10;In the game, players are merchants in Amsterdam near the turn of the 20th century. At the start of the game, two district cards are placed on each of the twelve spaces on the designated board. At the beginning of a round, the next two district cards, as well as two building and two profession cards (each from a deck of 54 of each type) are drawn to form the offer of six cards. Each of these cards has a cost in colored action cubes and grants a new action, special ability, or way to score points. In turn order, each player takes a card from those on offer. Finally, a market card is revealed that allows players to exchange money for victory points on their turn.&#10;&#10;Next, the six colored dice are rolled. Each player decides which of the six dice they would like (players may choose the same die), then takes as many action cubes in that color as the number of pips. Players place their new action cubes on their rotatable windrose as many spaces in the future as the number on the dice. Finally, the wheel is spun, so that players gain access to all cubes that were located on the 1 space of their windrose.&#10;&#10;Action cubes are used to purchase cards that a player has taken, claim one of the nine types of goods around the city of Amsterdam, and ferry goods or workers through canals to warehouses.

This means you need to corrupt government officials to place subsidies in your favor.&#10;&#10;Game basics:&#10;The game is for up to five players. Each player represents a mine owner. The goal of the game is to make enough money to leave the country in three years by corrupting government officials, stealing, snitching or by exploiting miners.&#10;&#10;Each year is divided into four quarters. One turn is one quarter. Each quarter is divided into three months (actions), which means one player gets three actions each turn.&#10; In total, each player gets three actions each turn and four turns each year.&#10;&#10;At the end of each year, the government gives subsidies and sets market prices.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of the third year (the twelfth turn). Players sell their minerals as usually and then count their money. The player with the most money wins. If there is a tie, the player with higher ranking card wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Each Policy vote is resolved (Pass or No pass) in turn&mdash;with the Center of Gravity token (COG) moving on the game board as the Policy dictates.&#10;&#10;The Political Animals game board is a grid with the four quandrants and a Moderate center representing player Agendas.

Knights face-off against each other over the course of a seven day tournament with each round consisting of a Court Phase and Joust Phase. At the end of the seven days, the knight with the most victory points is named King's Champion.&#10;&#10;Knights participate in one-on-one matches and gain reputation and gold for their victories. Between matches they visit the Court to gain new items or mounts, gain favors from nobles such as the King and Queen, mingle with nobles to increase their reputation, or gain additional training for their knight and squires.&#10;&#10;During the Court Phase players place their knights and squires within the Royal Court. Squires spend gold to purchase items for their knights while the knights use their reputation to gain them. Players can build their decks at the &quot;Training Grounds&quot; to be used in the Joust phase.&#10;&#10;During the Joust Phase players will compete against their opponent using their decks. Items gained or purchased in the Court Phase can be used during the joust to aid the knights. There are four passes within each joust. During a pass each player strategically plays three different cards from their hand consisting of the &quot;Herald&quot;, the &quot;Shield&quot;, and the &quot;Levee&quot;. Knights start with 10 stamina which they spend to play cards from their hand and lose it when they are hit by their opponent's &quot;Levee&quot;. If a knight's stamina reaches 0, they are unhorsed and can decide to remount if they still have a chance at victory. The first knight to score 10 points by the end of the fourth pass gains a victory token, gold, and reputation.&#10;&#10;At the end of the seventh day, players combine their victory point total based on their cards, victory tokens, and reputation points. The player with the most points wins the tournament!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
