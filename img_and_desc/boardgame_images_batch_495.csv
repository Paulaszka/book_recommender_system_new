Your ring of workers must remain in place for two additional turns for the remaining two layers to be added to the tower; if your ring is disrupted, you can complete it later to continue the tower-building. If you completely surround an opponent's tower, you can remove the top level of that tower from the board.&#10;&#10;In addition to building three complete towers, a player can also win by eliminating all of the opponent's workers from the game board.&#10;&#10;"

For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake.

Before the next chance (inning, possession, break, etc...) each player chooses a play from the hand they are dealt. Place it face up so everyone knows whos playing what. When the first person who chose correctly wins then he/she gets to collect all the cards that were played. Plus if his/her card was a +/- card then she could get more cards from the leftover pile or they can choose the cards that other players have to dump.

The rules include the different firearms available at the time (muzzle- and breach-loading rifles, pistols and carbines), cavalry, cover, morale, experience levels (a veteran figure will reload a weapon faster and have bonuses to morale, shooting and close combat), and a scenario simulating the last moments of the battle of Camerone.&#10;&#10;Scale: 1 mini = 1 man, 1 cm = 1 m, a turn = a few seconds&#10;&#10;"

Long ago they filled up all their cemeteries with their loved (and not so loved) ones. Now they&rsquo;ve run out of room so they have taken to dumping the bodies down the sewer (out of sight out of mind). You, enterprising 3rd Class Sewer Engineers (Plungers), see a chance to make some fast money and solve the corpse clog threatening to overwhelm the existing system. At a quiet back door behind the Treatment Plant a line of customers queue up for the bits and pieces you have on offer. Deliver them the right parts, aged to the right amount of time and you&rsquo;ll receive your reward.&#10;&#10;Needed to play: The deck of 27 cards&#10;10 eurocubes in each of 4 colors for the body parts (white for Bones, brown for Organs, gray for Brains and red for Hearts) and 9 black eurocubes for the rats&#10;1 eurocube marker in each of 2 other colors to keep track of player scores on the Gore Track&#10;1 large bag [or an old sock] (the Bag O&rsquo; Parts) to hold all the body parts, 10 small ziplock bags to act as body bags in the game and 1 four-sided die&#10;&#10;Setup: Place the 4 Sewer Pipe cards,  Gore Track, and the score markers between the Plungers (players).&#10;Shuffle the customer deck and deal 2 customers to each Plunger, placing the rest in a face down draw pile known as &ldquo;The Queue&rdquo;, next to the Sewer Pipe. Each plunger should place their customers face up in front of them.&#10;Shuffle the tool deck and deal 3 tools to each Plunger that they will use as their initial hand of cards. The remaining tool cards will be placed in a tool card draw deck next to The Queue.&#10;Place the body bags within reach of both Plungers. Each Plunger should take 1 body bag for each customer they have during the game. Lastly place all the body parts and rats in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Adding new body parts&#10;Roll 1d4 and add that value to the number of waiting customers in front of them. The Plunger will then blind draw that number of body parts from the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. Shift all existing body parts towards The Clog to make room for the incoming body parts. Rats will never move. Set aside any body parts that are shifted off of the Day 3 card into a reserve pile. Place the new body parts in the order they are drawn on the Sewer Pipe cards beginning from the rightmost space on the Day 1 card. If any rats are drawn they will be placed on the Rat spaces beginning from the far left of the Day 3 card. Any body part occupying a Rat space where a Rat will be placed, during this phase, will be removed and tossed back into the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.&#10;&#10;Roll 1d4 and place that many reserved Day 3 parts on The Clog card spaces, tossing the rest back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Filling orders&#10;Each customer card lists the number of parts required to fill the order.&#10;&#10;To fill an order a Plunger must choose all of any of 1 type of body parts on any one Sewer card (meeting the desired aging requirement) placing those parts in the customer&rsquo;s body bag. Any extra body parts not needed for the orders go back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. Plungers may use the body parts to attempt to fill 1, 2 or more customer orders as long as the body parts are of the desired type and aging. If a customer&rsquo;s complete order is filled the Plunger scores the money value, indicated in the lower right corner of the customer card, on the Gore Track. All body parts from this order are then tossed back in the Bag O&rsquo; Parts. A new customer is then drawn from The Queue.&#10;&#10;Tool Cards: Each Plunger may use one of their tool cards at any point during their turn. Once played, the card will be placed on a discard pile next to the tool card draw pile and a new card is drawn.&#10;&#10;Game End: The game ends in one of two ways:&#10;a. The Clog card has become full of body parts. In this case, the current Plunger finishes their turn and any final scoring is marked.&#10;b. All 10 customers have had their orders filled.&#10;&#10;The Plunger who has earned the most money is declared the winner and receives a promotion to 2nd Class Sewer Engineer.&#10;&#10;This game can be played solo as well.

Each game lasts around 20 minutes. Each player has a sugar glider, that has to collect as many fruits as possible by jumping from branch to branch.&#10;&#10;The sugar glider is a small marsupial that loves nectarous foods. As its name suggests, it&rsquo;s capable of gliding through the air, much like a flying squirrel.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;- A board depicting a tree with 61 cells.&#10;- 4 sugar gliders in different colours.&#10;- 60 food tiles in 5 types: 1 fruit, 2 fruits, 3 fruits, 4 fruits, 1 big fruit (5 points).&#10;- A carrying case.&#10;&#10;GAME PREPARATION&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a player color and takes the corresponding sugar glider.&#10;&#10;Leaving the center space empty, randomly distribute the 60 tiles face-up to the 60 other spaces on the tree, 1 per space.&#10;&#10;White starts by choosing any space with a white fruit (value 1 tile), and placing his sugar glider on it. The tile in that space will be his &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;. In turn, the other players do the same.&#10;    &#10;The game can start now. White plays first.&#10;&#10;GAME RULES&#10;&#10;The game is played in turns, counterclockwise. On your turn, you must either make your sugar glider jump or go into a brief state of torpor:&#10;&#10;JUMP&#10;&#10;Move your sugar glider in a straight line a number of spaces equal to your &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; (this means one space in the first turn). If you have no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider, you must use one from your reserve. Notice that purple fruits count as 5 movement points.&#10;&#10;Then you take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; that you just used, and put it beside yourself face-up. This is your &lsquo;reserve&rsquo;. If you had no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider and had to use a tile from your reserve, discard this tile to the game case; it cannot be used again for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;The tile on which your sugar glider has landed (if any) is your new &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;Exceptions:&#10;&#10;- The sugar gliders cannot jump outside the tree.&#10;- A sugar glider sitting in the center space can jump to any space on the board by spending any tile from his reserve (no need to match the length of the jump).&#10;- A sugar glider cannot move through another sugar glider.&#10;&#10;Example: Anna wishes to make her sugar glider jump, but there is no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath her sugar glider. She uses a &lsquo;2&rsquo; from her reserve, moves the sugar glider 2 spaces in a straight line, and discards the tile she&rsquo;s used to the case.&#10;&#10;TORPOR&#10;&#10;You don&rsquo;t move your sugar glider. Take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; from underneath your sugar glider (if there is one), and add it to your reserve.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;The game ends when all the sugar gliders are consecutively in a state of torpor, or when the tree runs out of tiles, whichever happens first.&#10;&#10;Each player sums the values of the tiles in his reserve (purple tiles count as 5 points). Highest score wins. In case of a tie, play again.&#10;&#10;VARIANT FOR 2 PLAYERS&#10;&#10;For shorter 2-player games, discard all the purple fruit tiles and 3 tiles of each other value. Then play on the inner board.&#10;&#10;"

The world is in ruins. All the major cities have been wiped away by a nuclear war. Flooded with radiation, the planet surface is largely unfit for life. Handfuls of survivors have found refuge in antinuclear bunkers, the largest of which is the Moscow Metro. The Metro has become humanity&rsquo;s last haven after Judgment Day.&#10;&#10;Metro 2033 is based on the popular Metro 2033 universe created by Russian writer and journalist Dmitry Glukhovsky. After the nuclear strike, thousands of survivors have found refuge in the Moscow underground (a.k.a., the Metro) &mdash; the biggest shelter in the world. In the stations and tunnels deep below the surface a new civilization emerges.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;&#10;Each player is a leader of one of the many factions of post-nuclear underground. In order to win, a faction has to achieve ten victory points (VPs). Each station under the faction's control gives it 1 VP; different quests also bring VPs when completed. The other way to win is to capture all four stations of Polis &mdash; the cultural and political heart of Metro. Each faction has a hero at its disposal. Heroes can travel the underground, gain quests and equipment that increases their abilities, fight opponents' heroes, attack stations, and so on. The army of a faction can also attack stations, and usually with better chances to win, but it can target only adjacent stations. Stations under factions' control produce resources &mdash; pigs, ammo and mushrooms &mdash; that are used to capture new stations, strenghten the army, buy equipment and obtain quests. The production of resources and other game events are determined by a special sequence. This sequence tells what will happen each round: production of certain recources, a vote for a new law, or a sudden attack from the dark that must be repelled.&#10;&#10;Players can attack stations with their armies or their heroes. Both have strength that may be increased by hiring new troops or buying useful equipment. When attacking a neutral station, the army/hero fights a random threat from the special deck and has to beat its strength. When attacking an opponent, the attacker confronts his army or hero. In battles between players a special set of combat cards is used; these cards give various bonuses to strength depending on the card chosen by the opponent, so the goal is to deduce which combat card will be used by the other side.&#10;&#10;"

The testudo is a 4-piece square formation and phalanx is a 4-piece linear formation, in which pieces move as one.&#10;&#10;The method of capture depends of the capturing formation (or lack of) and of the captured piece/pieces, and can be by approach, by flanking or by moving and replacing.&#10;&#10;There's 3 victory conditions: &#10;&#10;     capture all opponent latros (pieces)&#10;     capture the opponent centurion or,&#10;     when a player in the beginning of his turn can't move his centurion, he loses. &#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each player battles with a fleet of spacecraft by flicking coins into the Starzone target. The Starzone target is made up of different zones, and asteroids which litter space.  Which zone you hit determines which action you take: you can repair your spacecraft, activate your shields, add or destroy asteroids on the target, or damage your opponent's spacecraft. A special Zone Shift zone on the target allows you to change which actions can be activated by hitting each zone, adding a tactical element to the game. Your spacecraft has different sectors, and the health of each sector is given by hit points. When one sector is destroyed then your spacecraft is destroyed. The first player to destroy three of their enemy's fleet wins the game.&#10;&#10;Starzone is a fun and furious game of dexterity and strategy. Outwit your opponent using asteroids and zone-shifts. Find your enemy's weak spot and flick it into outer space!&#10;&#10;"

The original launch was accompanied by a small range of miniatures developed by Brigade Models. However the original designers, Patrick Doyle, Mike Tastsides and Doug Glover were serving members of the US armed forces and as such had more pressing demands on their time than playing games, so development of the rules understandably stalled.&#10;[...] We've avoided unnecessary changes to the core rules, being content to tinker around the edges with minor changes to the design system and the inclusion of a hex-less movement system. Our main goal has been to streamline the rules a little without drastically altering the flavour. Probably the one major change has been to do away with the 12-point movement system that allowed movement along hex edges - we abandoned this in our own games very early on. We've also removed the distinction between the Basic and Advanced versions of the game in favour of a single unified set of rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game uses miniatures of starfighters, it is played on a hex map but a set of rules to use hexless maps is also included. The main dice roll used is the 2d6 roll, this is modified by another kinf of dice (ranging from a d4 to a d12) based on the pilot skill. These dice rolls are used to resolve fights and control rolls when your fighter is going spinning around due to damages or wrong manouvers. The damage system is very interesting, being it not the &quot;classic&quot; set of boxes that have to be crossed out but a system that takes in account a series of debilitating damages that during the game, imposing each a number of malus and penalties, can render your fighter inoperative or totally destroyed. Statistics for the official fighter models are in the end of the book.&#10;&#10;These are introductory free rules, Brigade Models is going to publish in a near future more complete rules (this time you are going to buy them) that will also include campaign games rules, pilots' skill progression and others more convoluted situations not presented here.&#10;&#10;"
