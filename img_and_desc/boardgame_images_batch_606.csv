This is not obvious. Instead, it appears to be square due to the commonplace elongation of the diagonal dimension and/or shortening of the orthogonal dimension which is the universal convention for representing them.&#10;This implicates why a perfect mapping onto the surface of a 3-D sphere, from a circle rather than a square, is ideally suitable and achievable.]&#10;&#10;Fortunately, the players are not required to deal with any complex, confusing 3-D curvature characteristic to a spherical playing surface.&#10;&#10;This is the advantage to using flat 2-D representations of a spherical-surface, 3-D chess variant.&#10;&#10;"

As there are two packs, this makes a total of 120 cards per game.&#10;&#10;The game is a curious mix of Rummy and Whist. Each player gets 18 cards dealt to them. There now begins a phase of drawing and discarding until a player lays down a run or set of 5 cards (5 Nines or a run of five, for example). Bonuses and penalties are then scored and every player must reduce their hand to 13 cards.&#10;&#10;Then the auction begins and one player (or team if playing partnerships) will win the auction and then need to make that many tricks as bid. Card play is exactly the same as standard games like Whist. Royal Aces secured in this phase (or Release) score sizeable bonus points.&#10;&#10;It can be seen that strategy is needed at every phase. If you use a high scoring 5 cards in the first stage (known as Release), the cards used will not be available to you for the auction and card-play in the 2nd phase.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first player (or partnership) to score 1,000 points.&#10;&#10;"

Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&#10;&#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that type you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;"
