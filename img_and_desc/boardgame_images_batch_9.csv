Place the 6 Indians tokens on the START space on the outside track on the board. The remainder of the white stones should be placed in a convenient location off the board. Use all 6 moccasin cards with Indian names and sufficient POW WOW cards so that two cards can be dealt to each player. Shuffle the moccasin and POW WOW cards and deal 2 face down to each player. Players should conceal their hands. The POW WOW cards have no value in the game but can be traded among players as the game progresses.&#10;&#10;OBJECT&#10;The winner of the game is the holder of the moccasin card with the Indian that matches the color of the Indian token that leaves the last space on the track at the outside of the board (indicated by the two poles side by side).&#10;&#10;"

Or drift yourself southward to bask and mutate in the sun.&#10;&#10;The only other twist is that predators can only eat during certain player evolutionary stages. So trying not to mutate can be a very good idea at certain stages of the game. Being eaten costs you an evolutionary stage-so picking on the leader can help keep the game even.&#10;&#10;"

The course of mankind's bloody history has taken many a turn due to the assassin's bullet.  Any successful leader--whether criminal, business scientific religious or political--can suddenly become a target in these modern days.  The assassin strikes without warning, at the least expected time from the last expected quarter.  Be he professional or amateur, the assassin's primary weapon is his ability to blend with his background, to be &quot;one of the crowd&quot;.  It is his skill at doing so that enables him, like the hunter in the wild, to surprise and kill his quarry.  Unbeknownst to you, the world's greatest assassin could be your brother or sister, your spouse, your child or parent, or your friend seated beside you.  Perhaps you yourself are the next &quot;Jackal&quot;.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is a challenging card/board game for 3-6 players, aged ten and up.

Perhaps the intercession of an &quot;Interpol Officer&quot; might save you; perhaps not.  Perhaps an &quot;Espionage Agent&quot; will alert you to who among the players is the threat; perhaps not.  Perhaps the assassin will hit an &quot;Innocent Bystander&quot; instead of you' perhaps not.  And the players never know when the turn of the next card in the deck will bring the game to an end.  Like our fast-paced world, the action in ASSASSIN is furious and challenging, with just a hint of uncertainty and danger to add spice to the intoxicating mix.&#10;&#10;Blessed with colorful and eye-catching artwork, Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is both educational and entertaining.  Playable in under 90 minutes, it is the perfect game for social gatherings.  The rules are easily mastered, and included numerous options to make the strategy more or less challenging, and playing time shorter or longer.  The play can e lighthearted and friendly, or ruthlessly competitive, the rules allow for either, depending upon the style of play and the desires of your group.  So, if you are ready to face the challenge of touring Europe while a killer stalks your heels, shuffle the cards and sit down to play ASSASSIN.&#10;&#10;A fast-moving fun game for 3 to 6 friends to play in an evening!&#10;&#10;"

If so, roll the dice again, this time adding the numbers together to see how far a shot goes. If you get blank, blank, a gun blows up (remove a hunter). If you shoot far enough to hit the hare exactly, it blithely moves out of the way instead of being hit. If you roll the exact distance between two hunters, they shoot each other (if both aiming at the hare -- otherwise, only the one not aiming at the hare is shot) - remove the hunters. If you roll a number greater than the distance between two hunters, one of them dies - take your pick.&#10;&#10;"

Occasionally, Hit-Men can be penalized for making mistakes (cards are drawn and effects are carried out), sometimes attempts at rubbing out mob bosses may occur.  There are also opportunities for negotiation &aacute; la:  &quot;If you help me with a vote of support, I will pay for the next business venture you land on.&quot;  Cards, money and promises are all possible bargaining chips.

1135,,"Quest for Power is billed as a &quot;Game Masterless Role-Playing System&quot;. In actuality, it is a fantasy-themed board game where the board is constructed each play session from randomly dealt cards. It has all the trappings of a role-playing game: character generation, multiple races and professions, skills, spells, weapons, etc. But the actual game play is very much a board game: move along the board, turn over unexplored cards, and deal with the situation given on them. Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.&#10;&#10;Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S. (Random Adventure Game Generating System). The sub-title for the game is &quot;Darkness in the Light&quot; and it is called a &quot;Starter Set for Character Levels 1 - 3&quot;, presumably because other scenarios and rules for higher level characters were planned. As far as I know, no expansions for the game were ever produced and Infinite Imagination, Inc. is no more.&#10;&#10;"

The players take the roles of some of the important characters from the film (Ash, Henry, etc.) and try to defeat Evil Ash and his horde of Deadites.  The game can be played cooperatively where the evil forces are controlled by predetermined objectives, or instead one of the players can control all of the evil forces.  Game play consists of players searching the castle for allies and equipment they can use to fight the Deadites (flaming arrows, explosives, etc.) and the actual combating of the evil army.  Players win if they defeat the four evil champions.  Evil wins if Evil Ash gets the Book of the Dead out of the castle or if the Deadite army kills all of the players.&#10;&#10;"

The wind changes randomly however each turn and may play havoc with the best of plans. Since the sequence of play is that a player first chooses altitude and then turns over a wind card to see how the speed and direction change, it can be almost maddening trying to get anywhere with certainty. And it is not simply a matter of crossing a line, but actually landing on a specific spot. Some nice ideas are the accurate reflection that stronger winds exist at higher altitudes and at least in some sense the interplay between gas and ballast in piloting.&#10;&#10;"

This series of books is similar to the &quot;pick your path&quot; type of adventure books that TSR and many others published around this time (mid 1980's).  Fighting Fantasy was somewhat different in that you created a character and rolled for combat and other effects instead of automatically succeeding in whatever path you chose (like a Tunnels and Trolls solo dungeon).&#10;&#10;Anyway, the game is very similar to Dungeon from TSR.  Characters roam the labyrinth fighting creatures and gaining treasures to increase their power.  Characters have three stats: Skill, Stamina, and Luck and these affect both combat and various perils that are held in the dungeon such as traps.  The object of the game is to travel to the end of the dungeon and open the Warlock's treasure chest.  Along the way players must deduce the correct combination of three keys which will open the chest, and find or steal the appropriate keys.  This is done through a mechanic exactly like Parker Brother's Clue game: you ask players if they have any key cards of a particular number and secretly note down what their answers are.  The first player to open the Warlock's treasure chest wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Fighting Fantasy Game Book is located Here&#10;&#10;"

There are seven different units: King, Knight, Archer, Heavy Infantry, Infantry, Mercenary, and Peasant.  Each turn players can perform any 2 actions: move, turn, or attack.  Foot units move one square forward per action.  Mounted units move as many unblocked squares in front of them as they like.  Units attack the square they are facing (archers attack an area of squares in front of them).  Attacks are resolved by rolling the combat dice.  Each appropriate symbol rolled (axes or arrows) counts as a &quot;hit&quot;.  Scoring more hits than the target has hit points removes some of the units (miniatures) from the target army.

In the building phase, players decide on the height of the buildings and build them at the side of the board; if they have the necessary permit, they can build on the board itself.
