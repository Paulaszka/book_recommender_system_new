Each player receives a bunch of little plastic pieces and 2 large ones (gnome crystals) with an irregular shape.&#10;&#10;The object is to score the most points by the time the game ends, which happens immediately when someone runs out of pieces to play. A point is scored by having a straight or diagonal arrangement of three crystals of the same color, and a large crystal as part of such an arrangement scores 2 points instead of 1. A line of 4 crystals scores twice, once for each &quot;end&quot; of the row.&#10;&#10;The game is played by rolling two dice, one for each side of the grid (rows and columns). After rolling the dice, the player places them on the appropriate row and column that matches the die face. Then the player can place a crystal in any empty location on either the row or column indicated. They can also choose to &quot;combat&quot; another player's crystal on the specific intersection of the rolled dice. Combat involves a simple die-off, defender wins ties, with a large crystal providing a +1 bonus to the roll.&#10;&#10;Finally, if a player rolls doubles and is able to place a crystal on the intersection (say row 3 and column 3), then they get to roll again.&#10;&#10;"

Based on the action-packed drama airing every Monday night at 9:00 p.m. (8:00 p.m. Central) on Fox, the 24&trade; TCG is scheduled to launch in August 2007 and builds on the success established by Press Pass with its critically acclaimed Fullmetal Alchemist TCG.&#10;&#10;Currently in its sixth season, 24&trade; follows the life of CTU agent Jack Bauer (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his allies, minute by minute, through a single 24-hour day full of heart-stopping action and intense drama as they work to quell a threat to the American people. The Emmy award-winning series boasts nearly 16 million viewers each week and has inspired a wide range of licensed properties, including PlayStation2 video games, novels, comic books, and an upcoming line of action figures.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;This is a license we&rsquo;re thrilled to get,&rdquo; said Edward Bolme, TCG Product Manager for Press Pass. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re designing this game to capture the essence of action and tension that the show portrays. We think the fans will find it a very exciting and attractive game.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Fans of 24&trade; will love this game,&rdquo; added Virginia King, Executive Director of Fox Licensing and Merchandising. &ldquo;Serious collectors who don&rsquo;t play games will want to collect these cards.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Created by the award-winning Press Pass, Inc. design team responsible for the Fullmetal Alchemist TCG (voted #1 New TCG of 2005 by readers of Scrye and InQuest and Best Anime TCG of 2006 by Anime Insider), the 24&trade; TCG will let you play either with or against CTU in a fast-paced struggle for victory. The game will feature 24-card decks and can be played in 15 to 20 minutes. Press Pass will also conduct a comprehensive marketing and promotion campaign as well as an aggressive tournament system.&#10;&#10;"

The player in lane #1 spins and moves that many spaces forward on the track, followed by the car in lane #2, and so on. To change lanes, the car moves sideways (not diagonally) on the track. If a player spins or lands on a &quot;Draw Card&quot; space, they draw a card from the &quot;PIT&quot; deck and follows the directions. To overtake another car, players must drive around the car ahead unless their spin lands them directly on the same space. In this case, the overtaken car moves back one space and the passing car takes their position. Use the score pad to track the number of laps. After 6 laps, the game ends and the winner is the first car to pass the finish line.&#10;&#10;"
