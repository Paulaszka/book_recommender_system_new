You get all the great action of the game on the ice with NHL Ice Breaker. Game play is built around CSE Games' specially-designed 54-card playing deck (52 standard suited cards plus two Jokers). Each action in NHL Ice Breaker is based on the basic principle of high hand wins. Opponents play their card(s) at the same time to battle for puck possession, and the player with the highest hand gets to execute his/her action indicated on the card(s) played.&#10;&#10;As players win hands, the puck is moved up the ice (game board) and toward the opponent's net. Along the way, players may land on special &ldquo;Ice Breaker&rdquo; squares, which can shift momentum in an instant. Ice Breaker actions include penalties, big hits, turnovers or great passes. Once in the Shooting Zone, it's a classic contest of shooter versus goalie. Did you play your cards right?&#10;&#10;NHL Ice Breaker separates itself from other hockey-based games in that it has a true hockey 'feel'. The game is both accurate and fast-paced. Combining elements of popular card games, players must decide how best to play their cards. Cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, or three-of-a-kind. It is up to the player to decide which cards to play and how to play them.&#10;&#10;The learning curve of NHL Ice Breaker is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned within a couple of minutes, aided by the built-in familiarity that the playing deck offers. NHL Ice Breaker is designed for one to four players, ages eight (8) and up.&#10;&#10;For more information, check out www.csegames.com.&#10;&#10;"

The unexpected and dogged resistance of the Republican Army, which was fully involved in a deep reorganization, caused the failure of this offensive, forcing the Nationalists to give up trying to storm the capital and making them take the long road by capturing the whole country before being able to declare themselves victorious.&#10;&#10;After the failure of Franco's Nationalist troops to surround and conquer Madrid during the first months of the Spanish Civil War, Spain looked doomed to a long war of attrition.  During this gloomy period, a new force made its appearance -- the motorized Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV).  Lavishly equipped and overconfident after its first successful performance in the fall of Malaga, the Italians thought they could quickly and easily end the war.  Spain was not Abyssinia, however, and Madrid was not Malaga.  The new People's Republican Army was no longer the rag-tag mix of militia units that had fought the Nationalists only a few months before.  The Italians were repulsed after a fierce campaign fought under very tough conditions.  Madrid was once again saved for the Republicans, and two more years of war would ensue.&#10;&#10;Special rules regarding tanks, anti-tank defenses, flamethrowers, truck transports, traffic jams, morale, and panic will allow you to recreate the Italian offensive.
