You may even come across polar bears, boars or the mysterious and deadly Smoke Monster.&#10;As well as being uniquely structured to encompass the events of 6 seasons of LOST, this game is very heavy on theme and detail.&#10;The sheer depth of the game, and the large number of Encounter cards, ensures that even after several plays there will still be more surprises left for you.&#10;So step aboard Flight 815 and be prepared to begin the ultimate LOST experience...&#10;&#10;A summary of play&#10;You will start the game rolling a die and moving around the outer track of the Island Game Board, visiting locations such as the Barracks, the Cockpit section, the Black Rock and the Hatch. When rolling the &lsquo;Eye&rsquo; symbol you do not move and should instead draw one of your Flash-backwards card (later in the game Flash-forwards and Flash-sideways cards are used). Your &lsquo;Flash&rsquo; cards usually instruct you to increase or decrease your Skill points or gain Fate points.&#10;&#10;When you visit certain locations, and have encounters, the marker on the story track will be steadily advanced. When the story track reaches certain points, changes will be made to the game; for example the Encounter Deck being used may change to another one, or certain Friends counters may become de-activated.&#10;The story track will also instruct you and the other players to move to one of the separate game boards or a different game track on the main board.&#10;&#10;As you progress through the various stages of the game, the Encounter decks will continually change so that you meet people and find items from the different seasons of the LOST saga. Also your chosen character&rsquo;s skill points will gradually improve making future challenges easier, and you will gain all important Fate points.&#10;&#10;You will receive Mystery Counters as rewards. Each of the various mysteries depicted (for example Jacob, the Numbers) is made up of a set of 5 cards. If you can collect a complete set, they can be traded in for additional Fate points.&#10;&#10;Eventually the action will move to the centre track on the game board where one of the players will be chosen to succeed Jacob. The end game will then commence. Along with the other players you must defeat the Man in Black and play the Desmond card at the Light Source space in order to save the island and win the game. Whichever player has the most Fate points at this point is declared the winner, but should your fail and allow the Man in Black to survive, all players lose the game.&#10;&#10;LOST &lsquo;The End&rsquo; is a Print and Play board game from MM Games, for 2 to 4 players, due for release in November 2010.&#10;It takes on average between 2 to 3 hours to complete a game.&#10;&#10;This game is non-profit making and is a fan-made project intended for the entertainment of fans of the the TV series LOST.

Play can now begin.&#10;&#10;The starting player places a card of his choosing in the middle. This can be one or more of the same value. The other player must now put a card or cards of one greater value (i.e. 6s on 5s, Js on 10s, all cards must be the same rank); if they are unable to do so there is a 'stop'. As Kings are high (no Aces), a King will also force a stop. At which point the player who played last starts the run again with any card(s) of their choice.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to get rid of your cards, and scoring is&#10;accumulative, with the winner in each round scoring the total number of pips in his opponent's hand (court cards score 10).&#10;&#10;Playing the comet&#10;&#10;The comet is a wild card and can be played with a group or on its own. It always forces a stop.&#10;&#10;If a player wins the round and his opponent still holds the comet, the winning player scores double (the comet will therefore count as 18 points).&#10;&#10;If a player wins by playing the comet, he scores double also.

By gathering the essence of creation - chaos, matter and life - and turning it into seas and mountains, birds and beasts, you hope to win Gods approval - and the game!

And beware of the dark angel who's trying to outshine you all.&#10;&#10;Now - let there be light!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Contents1 game board&#10;1 God&#10;1 dark angel&#10;6 player angels&#10;42 day work markers&#10;1 starting player marker&#10;72 essence cubes&#10;1 rules booklet&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;GameplayBefore the creation, the players&rsquo; angels are gathered in the void with God. When God starts the creation with the words &quot;let there be light&quot;, the angels start their monumental task. There&rsquo;s a lot do to and only seven days to get it done in, so every action counts. Throughout the game, God moves over each of the seven days on the game board, stopping morning, midday and evening, allowing the players 21 rounds to act. During their turn, players can choose to collect the essence of creation (chaos, matter and life), to do a day work on the current day using the different kinds of essence they have collected, or to follow in God&rsquo;s path to another day.&#10;&#10;When players move from day to day, they&rsquo;re positioned along the essence track. The essence track determines both the order of play and the type of essence a player can gather. The first player to move to a certain day gets the first position, the second player the second position, and so on. As different positions yield different kinds of essence, the players must plan their movement to get the right kind and the right amount of essence. If they&rsquo;re not happy with their position, they can spend essence to swap positions with a neighboring angel, thereby also thwarting other players&rsquo; plans.&#10;&#10;When God creates a new day with new tasks for the angels, players can move to that day. The first player to do a day work on a certain day is awarded the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. As the week progresses, the points earned for doing a day work increase, which affects players&rsquo; long-term strategy.&#10;&#10;As the seventh day is a day of rest, God looks favorably on angels that retire from their hard work. The first player to retire their angel on the seventh day earns the highest points, the second player the second highest, and so on. When God reaches the evening of the seventh day, the game is over. All points will be tallied and the player with the highest score is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;To make things even more challenging, a dark angel is mixed in with the players&rsquo; angels, doing his best to snatch as many points as possible. The dark angel follows a pre-determined pattern of actions that the players can predict and delay but never stop. If the players aren&rsquo;t careful, or if they&rsquo;re too caught up in their own plans, the dark angel will surely outshine them, making all of them lose the game.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are quite simple: the sooner you do a day work on a day, the higher the points you score, making it a good idea to keep close in God&rsquo;s wake. Unfortunately, simply following God throughout the creation might not give you the exact essence you need to do your day work. Eventually you must stop to collect essence, preferably in the right position, making you lose momentum. In the end it&rsquo;s always about choices: when and what to collect, when to move and when to do a day work. The winner, God willing, is the player who makes the right choices at the right time, a task easier said than done.&#10;&#10;"

The rules are intended to be used with 15mm model miniatures (although they can easily be adapted for use with other scales) and owe much to the work done by Phil Barker and Richard Bodley-Scott in De Bellis Antiquitatis, Chris Kemp in Not Quite Mechanised, and Tim Price in Simple Combat Resolution Using Dice (S.C.R.U.D.) (see WI64).&quot;&#10;&#10;Game uses 6-sided dice.

Being skilled natural engineers, and determined to reclaim their lands, the Maoris constructed forts called 'pahs' (or pas) on disputed territory and dared white men (pakehas) to attack. The British and Colonial troops seemed only too happy to oblige and, when enough losses had been inflicted to satisfy utu ('revenge' or 'payment'), the Maoris simply evacuated their trenches and rifle-pits. The conflict was also marked (later) by some guerrilla fighting, but its main feature was the defence and reduction of these ingenious native forts.&quot;&#10;&#10;Essentially, the game is organized as a skirmish around the taking/defending of a &quot;native&quot; fort of the defending player's design. System uses d6 and d12 for various checks.&#10;&#10;Each figure represents one man. Rules were written to support 25mm figures, but can be adapted to different scales.&#10;&#10;This simple system does include rules for Morale.&#10;&#10;Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #63 (December 1992)&#10;&#10;"

The game strategy fully depends on player's skills.&quot;&#10;&#10;My brief description of how the game is played and the goal:&#10;&#10;During the game, players attempt to race their 14 pieces around the Backgammon board, counter-clockwise, blocking their opponent's pieces along the way by occupying a point (a single piece on a point cannot be captured in this variant, in fact, there is no capturing at all) or by building a &quot;wall&quot; (two stacked pieces on a point make a wall) that no piece, friendly or otherwise, can pass over.  Movement, in this game, is only from quadrant to quadrant, each quadrant consisting of 6 points (1 thru 6, 7 thru 12, 13 thru 18, 19 thru 24).  The second piece on the wall has special ability of jumping over any wall that might be in the way to land in the next quadrant (hense the name &quot;Grasshopper&quot;).  Walls can only be built by moving a piece from the previous quadrant that is exactly 6 points away to a point that has one piece on it.  Once the players get their pieces to the 4th quadrant, they must build walls on the quadrant.  These walls (two piece stacks) can be borne off the board as a unit for the players turn.  The winner is the first player to bear off two walls consecutively, but not necessarily in two consecutive turns.&#10;&#10;"

Set to this background the players represent members of the royal family and try to locate good sites for new oil wells, find and deliver the different oil qualities and ship them to their base camps.&#10;&#10;However, the oil field is so huge that the players have to memorize where which oil quality is to be found. Moreover, the competing players are likely to interefere with the player's intentions.&#10;&#10;To win the game, it is mandatory to collect oil qualities of different kinds, always keeping an eye on the ever changing prices. Balancing this will help !&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Boardgame News annoucement.&#10;&#10;As for the game play, Ghawar is a pick-up-and-deliver game with a roll-and-move mechanism on top of a memory element. On a 13x13 game board, 36 oil platforms are laid out in a 6x6 square with one empty space between each pair of platforms. Players seed these platforms with 36 coloured &quot;oil stones&quot; with nine cubes in each of four colors.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling two dice and placing one of their five oil wells on the unoccupied platform at this location in the grid; if a player rolls 2-5, for example, she can choose row 2, column 5 or the other way around. Once all the oil rigs are placed, the second half of the game begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either rolls a die to move the truck, train or both vehicles a number of spaces equal to the die roll or moves one of the oil rigs to an adjacent location, most likely covering an oil stone previously exposed.&#10;&#10;If a player's truck starts or ends its movement by an oil rig and doesn't already have a load, the truck's owner can lift the oil rig and buy the oil stone underneath it, paying the rig's owner the current value of the oil.&#10;&#10;You can't purchase oil stones that aren't covered as there must be a well in place to bring the oil to the surface. You must bring the oil to your side of the board to deliver it before you can pick up another oil stone with the truck.&#10;&#10;When your train ends its movement by an empty platform the train picks up the platform so that you can carry it back to your camp. At the end of the game, players lose points based on their relative standings in the number of platforms collected.&#10;&#10;The game ends once all the oil stones have been delivered. If any player has failed to collect at least one of each type of stone, that player loses the game. Players still in the game score points for each oil stone they possess, for having more of their favored type of oil than anyone else, for collecting barrels, and for having lots of money due to sales. If you have the fewest stones of a type, less money than anyone else, and fewer platforms than someone else, you'll lose points. The player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;"

The system includes statistics for alien technology and weird war style creatures like zombies and werewolves, so most modern and futuristic settings can be played.&#10;&#10;Gruntz only uses D6 die for all rolling and the core mechanic is based around a 2D6 roll adding a number from the models statistics and to succeed at a task you must beat a certain target number. For example if you wanted a unit of Gruntz to shoot at another unit, you add the Shoot statistic of the Gruntz firing to your 2D6 roll and must equal or exceed the ToHit statistic of the target model. For most actions you modify the roll depending on certain conditions.&#10;&#10;Initiative is based on a standard turn sequence or playing card base initiative which adds a series of special conditions for any Ace cards drawn and assigned to units.&#10;&#10;"

Only a few people know the truth.&#10;&#10;Jaws: Deep Red Sea is a fast-playing, non-authorised, non-profit, and non-collectable card game based on the films. This game is a shark-filled, blood pumping experience, where all players draw from the same central deck. Each player manages their hand of cards - to defend their beaches as well as play scarily large Great White Sharks against their opponent's swimwear-clad vacationers.&#10;&#10;Each player takes on the role of a desperate mayor, managing a small seaside town in the midst of a blood-soaked crisis, fending off an unknown number of Great White sharks.'&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10 vacationers and $10,000. Money is spent in the game buying Shark Hunters and equipment. Players can also, at any time, spend cash to alter Shark Attack dice rolls, setting the situations up whereby opponents' bathers may be devoured by monstrous Great Whites. Also, some cards, like &quot;Beach Closed,&quot; cost the target mayor cash, from revenues lost, forcing them to buy less Anti-shark gear. Money is generally in short supply. Steal or swindle it from other mayors if you can.&#10;&#10;Last mayor with his beach still full of bathers wins.&#10;&#10;NOTE: There is no player elimination. When a mayor has run out of holidaymakers, all his cards and poker chips are removed, and then he can only play Shark Attack cards on the players remaining - attacking the mayor with the most vacationers left in play (he's got the most bathers in the sea). If there is a tie, the player playing the Shark Attack card decides who to devour.&#10;&#10;"
