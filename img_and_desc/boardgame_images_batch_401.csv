Score by creating your syzygy on tiles of the same color.  Your opponents will try to thwart you by blocking your path and &quot;swapping&quot; your stones off to far-reaching corners of the board.

The pawns' strengths are decided by a two-dimensional scissors-paper-stone method, based on some of Aisopos' fables: The human outsmarts the fox, the fox takes the mouse, but the mouse defeats the human. The Lion defeats both human, fox and mouse, which in turn all three defeat the ant. But the ant is the only one who defeats the lion.&#10;&#10;Players start with 2 of each creature and take turns either placing a hidden pawn or moving an already placed pawn. If you move onto another pawn, the attacker secretly looks at the defending pawn, and the defeated pawn is taken off the board and placed before the winning pawn's player.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is completely out of pawns, and the winner is the player who has most points in defeated pawns. The different creatures are worth different amount of points.&#10;&#10;"
