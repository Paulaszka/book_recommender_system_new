The results of weapon fire are decided by casting a six-sided die and adding modifiers to account for factors such as distance. The types of weapon fire, in increasing order of deadliness, are carbines, solid shot batteries, muskets, rifles, and grape shot batteries.&#10;&#10;When enemy troops encounter each other, they cannot fire and must engage in melee. Each side rolls a six-sided die, multiplies the result by the number of units in action, and then adds modifiers to account for the quality and morale of the troops. The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or surrenders. Surrendering is the best result from the point of view of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher.&#10;&#10;Grosstaktik is appropriate for re-enacting battles from the War of the League of Augsburg, the War of Spanish Succession, the War of Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and the War of American Independence. The booklet includes short descriptions of each of these conflicts.&#10;&#10;Note:  Publisher not list.  Game is listed on back page along with other games from Guidon Games. Red Cover.&#10;&#10;"

The runners can hold up to five wooden pearls, each pearl color representing a continent. A runner can move 1-6 squares, depending on the number of pearls it holds. The more, the slower. The runners try to pick up pearls from each continent (by moving there); they can lose pearls and start over by being jumped over by another runner. The first player to return to his/her home continent(s) with all runners, each runner holding five colors of pearls, is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)&#10;&#10;A round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action &ndash; the alliance card &ndash; a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.&#10;&#10;The game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.&#10;&#10;"

The &quot;Holder&quot; holds the ends of the brick firmly, using two hands, so that its center is exposed. Face the &quot;Chopper&quot; and place the brick about chest high, holding it away from your body. This is the &quot;Ready&quot; position. As the &quot;Chopper&quot;, face the &quot;Holder&quot; and place your chopping hand lightly over the exposed brick to aim. Then lift your hand to touch your ear. IMPORTANT - If you are RIGHT handed, use your LEFT hand - and if you are LEFT handed, use your RIGHT hand for the chopping hand.&#10;TO PLAY: 1) The &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; to begin the contest. After announcing &quot;Ready&quot;, the &quot;Holder&quot; may fake, pull the brick aside, or do anything to try to fool his opponent, the &quot;Chopper&quot;, into committing himself. He must always return the brick to the &quot;Ready&quot; position to give the &quot;Chopper&quot; a chance to strike again. After each point is made the &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; before a new strike can be made. 2) The &quot;Chopper&quot; MUST KEEP HIS HAND AGAINST HIS EAR UNTIL he is READY TO CHOP. He can fake - but must always keep his hand touching the ear during the fake. Once he has started a chop, taking his hand from his ear, he must CONTINUE the chop and try to hit the brick.&#10;TO SCORE: The &quot;CHOPPER&quot; scores one point if he strikes the brick. The &quot;HOLDER&quot; scores one point if the &quot;Chopper&quot; misses the brick.&#10;After every 5 tries the players change places. The first one to score 11 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage, but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb. Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters. The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game; conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.
