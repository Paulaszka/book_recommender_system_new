Based on the rules of the Dominoes, it is a mix between a puzzle and a strategy game that you can play alone or  with/against  up to 10 friends.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 88 hexagonal tiles, each made of three diamond-shaped faces. Visually, each piece looks like a 2D representation of a cube. The tiles are made from six varieties of color, plus some black tiles.&#10;&#10;The rules of The Grid Game are simple:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each player gets a number of tiles, depending on the number of players. &#10;     You have to connect tiles by color and height.&#10;     In order to play a tile it has to touch two tiles at the same time &#10;     There are special black tiles that serve to block further advance; no tile, even another black one, can touch a black tile.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players take turns placing tiles according to these rules until no one can make another move, first one to use all his/her tiles, wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Chip It, players need to rid themselves of both cards and chips to win the game. The problem? Getting rid of your cards might require you to take chips!&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a random hand of cards and a few chips. On a turn, you either play cards to the center of the table (with you beating the cards previously played, if any) or return two chips to the stock.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the first player to play cards lays down one or more cards of the same value. You can take chips from the stock to alter the value of the cards you play. With a red card, each chip you take adds 1 to the value of that card; with a yellow card, each chip you take adds the value of the card to itself. If you play a red 7 and a yellow 4, for example, you can take two chips from the stock to make the 7 an 8 and the 4 an 8, and now you've played a pair of 8s. (Chip It has green and purple cards instead of red and yellow ones.)&#10;&#10;To play cards on top of this, you must play a pair of 9s or some stronger pair. If you cannot play or choose not to play, you must return two chips to the stock. You are still in the round, but if all players pass in turn, then the player who last played cards clears the pile and plays whatever they wish (or returns two chips to the stock, passing the lead to the right).&#10;&#10;Whoever first has no cards in hand and no chips in front of them wins!&#10;&#10;"

The movement mechanic is simple and very realistic for various types of vehicles, vessels, crafts and different kinds of weapons (guns, missiles, torpedoes...). The system is flexible and allows easy and precise positioning and determination of distance. The board is covered with a net of equilateral triangles. The vertices are points where pieces are positioned, while lines determine direction of the piece or marker.&#10;&#10;"

All game elements are contained in a ziplock. This game was later substantially revised and upgraded and published in a new game Battle of Oshi-jou, with a larger map, revised rules and more than double the number of units.&#10;&#10;The 1590 Siege of Oshi (&#229;&#191;&#141;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132; Oshi-j&#197;&#141; no tatakai) was a battle during Japan's Sengoku period. Oshi Castle, a stronghold of the Narita clan, was besieged by forces loyal to the Toyotomi clan. The castle was famously defended for over a month by a force consisting of only 619 samurai and 2000 local conscripts against forces numbering over 20,000. The battle is also famous for the actions of Lady Kai (&#231;&#148;&#178;&#230;&#150;&#144;&#229;&#167;&#171; / Kaihime), who led 200 Narita men into battle to rout the initial attack against the castle.&#10;&#10;The game incorporates standard hex-and-counter movement on a map representing the region around the castle. The game proceeds in an &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; manner. Units may perform ranged fire in an attempt to cause enemy units to become disordered (recovery from disorder may be attempted at the beginning of each turn). Enemy units may also return fire to cause disorder on their attackers. Close combat proceeds on a simplified, odds-based combat resolution table using a single die (d6), and can result in disorder, losses and retreat. If an army suffers enough losses, it becomes demoralized, suffering combat penalties and the elimination of any unit that becomes disordered. The game includes special rules for Lady Kai's ability to boost the morale of conscript units under her.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    A4 map (210mm &times; 297mm / 8.3&quot; &times; 11.7&quot;)&#10;    50 mounted, back-printed counters (not die-cut)&#10;    A5 rulebook: two pages historical notes, four pages &quot;Warring States Folio&quot; series rules, two pages game-specific rules&#10;&#10;&#10;(User description)&#10;&#10;"

You will be weaving your own stories, worthy of the greatest comic book sagas. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned veteran of tabletop miniature games, or a new recruit to this rewarding hobby, you&rsquo;ll soon be controlling your own super-team, and battling for control of Metropolis, the Earth at large, or even the entire galaxy!&#10;&#10;The DC Universe Miniature Game is designed for two or more players, with each taking control &#10;of a number of finely detailed miniatures, representing their faction, or team. The miniatures are in essence playing pieces, much like those you&rsquo;d find in a board game. But unlike most board games, a miniature game doesn&rsquo;t take place on a readily defined board, but rather the players take an active role in designing their own custom gaming area, usually on a tabletop &#10;populated by scratch-built scenery. The rules use a sophisticated system of power counters &#10;and unique character abilities, allowing you to move your models freely and utilize a large &#10;range of skills and powers to give you a tactical edge over your opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.&#10;&#10;Sequence of Play&#10;&#10;Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:&#10;&#10;1.  Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually &#10;up to the character&rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.&#10;&#10;2.  Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This &#10;stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up &#10;going last in the next.&#10;&#10;3.  Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and &#10;resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single &#10;model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act &#10;have done so.&#10;&#10;4.  Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked.

It covers the ancient and medieval periods (up to about 1500 AD). Troops are divided into 26 types depending on armament, tactics, and quality, and based on stands of uniform width. All movement and combat is by stand or group of stands.  There is no individual casualty counting or other book keeping, casualties are assumed to have negligible impact on a stand's fighting strength until its cohesion breaks and the survivors scatter beyond game relevance. Each player has 1d6 Command Points each turn to move his troops around the battlefield, after which all troops within range of the enemy automatically fight.&#10;&#10;The army list database, known as &quot;Meshwesh&quot;, is freely available online (see links).&#10;&#10;The basing scheme approximates, and is largely compatible with, the widely used WRG/DBX basing.&#10;&#10;"

The player oversees several game characters as they fulfill missions in this challenging environment. These characters represent a declining pagan population that is caught between the New Religion and the spiteful counter-religion known as the Growing Evil. This latter division includes ruffians, malicious necromancers, the infamous NecroFiend occultists, and demons from foul depths.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into 3 stages to represent the different missions to be undertaken. Each mission/stage involves coping with the New Religion in some way. In the first stage you seek to undo damage created by the New Religion. In the second stage you must impede the New Religion. And finally the third stage requires that you directly confront the New Religion.&#10;&#10;GAME-PLAY:&#10;Player guided characters will travel on a map that is generated by land tiles. These tiles are drawn and placed as the characters move from turn to turn. At the same time, game controlled characters known as NecroFiends will be spawned; eventually traveling the tile map through an automated movement system. When player characters run into a NecroFiend, conflict is likely to occur.&#10;&#10;In addition to NecroFiends, opposition can emerge through the Occurrence deck (from entering a tile) or through the Demon deck (upon exiting a tile). These encounters gnaw away at a character's vital resource --their followers. Followers are represented by purple cubes. When a game character (aka Leader) takes losses due to conflict, some or all of their followers are removed. A lack of followers makes a character extremely vulnerable and will often lead to elimination from the game if more followers cannot be acquired soon.&#10;&#10;Combat in the world of Black Metal is resolved through two means, Brute Conflict and DarkArts Conflict. The former combat type is associated with physical conflict and uses a Combat Results Table involving up to three 4-sided dice. The latter combat type is associated with sorcery and uses a simpler system involving the combatants INSIGHT ratings and a single 4-sided die.&#10;&#10;OBJECT:&#10;The player aims to fulfill at least one mission during the game. The game offers the opportunity to perform up to three missions. Missions are drawn from a deck and will describe locations that must be visited, along with actions that must be performed at these locations. Actions often include a special die roll procedure to solidify the outcome. The third mission will always involve conflict (using the game's conflict resolution system).&#10;&#10;WINNING THE GAME:&#10;To win Black Metal a player must fulfill every mission that is embarked upon. There are 3 levels of success --one for each mission that you accomplish. The game is lost if all player characters perish during the performance of a mission, regardless of how many missions have been completed. The earned titles of success are as follows:&#10;&#10;1 Mission Fulfilled  = Hero Status&#10;2 Missions Fulfilled  = Liberator Status&#10;3 Missions Fulfilled  = Legend Status&#10;&#10;Without losing, you may end a game after any mission (but before another has begun).&#10;&#10;"

On each turn, the peddler places one of his goods face up, while the farmers each play one of their goods cards. The farmer with the highest value card takes the peddler's item, and the peddler writes down the difference between the value of what he sold and what he accepted as his profit (or loss) on that card.&#10;&#10;The play repeats until the cards are exhausted. At that point, the peddler adds up his net profit, while the farmers add up the total value of the goods they have purchased. If the peddler's profit is greater than the total value purchased by any farmer, he wins; otherwise, the farmer with the greatest value of products wins.&#10;&#10;The rules say that for two players, both are farmers competing for peddler cards as they are turned over. For 5 or 6 players, the farmer cards are distributed equally, but it is suggested that the peddler again be a non-player, as otherwise the peddler will almost certainly win.&#10;&#10;"

If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.&#10;&#10;"

From time to time, the Great Houses vie for influence on the planet with both armies and intrigue.&#10;&#10;Objective: Be the first faction or alliance to control four cities, or control the most cities before a ceasefire ends the game. Control a city by building a stack of cards that is larger than all opposing card stacks on that city. Obtain more cards by controlling cities, trafficking in the spice harvest, and engaging in reputational intrigue.&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence: Repeat this sequence each turn until the game is over.&#10;&#10;1. Weather: determine the first player in the turn order by flipping cards from the top of the draw deck to the harvest pile until a player&rsquo;s suit is drawn; the first player starts the action phase and decides if turn order proceeds clockwise or counter-clockwise. Each time a face card is drawn, alliances may be made or broken.&#10;&#10;2. Action: each player in turn order either takes an action or passes; when all players consecutively pass, the phase ends; then, check for military victory.&#10;&#10;3. Harvest: player or players tied for the most cards in pile draw 1 for each enemy suit present in pile then take 1 of own cards from pile.&#10;&#10;4.

Income: shuffle and place all discards at the bottom of the draw deck; give each player 1 card, then award 1 card for each controlled city, then award 1 card for each adjacent pair of controlled cities.&#10;&#10;Military Victory is declared at end of the Action phase by a single player or an alliance that controls 4 cities. The victors seize control of Spice production, forcing an end to the hostilities, and the game ends immediately.&#10;&#10;Ceasefire is declared if the draw deck is depleted.

Loud sounds now, the gears, the clacking of Bogey wheels over terrain, the vibration of the motor...then, &quot;Hull down, hull down,&quot; is called out to the driver.  The Commander orders, &quot;Traverse, traverse...TRAVERSE!&quot;  The turret moves slowly, the sounds of machinery moving but slow, too slow!

It consists of a metal spinning disk on top of a spinning arm with a white pointer and circle on one end and a red pointer on the other, all mounted in a yellow metal bowl.&#10;&#10;The first game is a dog race. The spinning wheel is divided in six equal and color-coded segments with an illustration of a running dog in those colors. Each segment is divided into four unequal pieces marked with different payout odds (2-1, 4-1, 6-1 and 8-1). Players place bets on a separate betting mat divided into the six color boxes and spin the wheel. Where the pointer stops, that dog wins at the indicated odds and everyone else loses their bets. The player ending with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;Outside the dog segments, however, the wheel is divided into 32 segments, each with a single letter. Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except for the five vowels (which get 2 spaces each) and a final square marked &quot;any letter&quot;. The rules for this game are not clear absent the instructions, but a box illustration says that &quot;Every correct word scores&quot;, suggesting that players perhaps must come up with as many words as possible starting with the letter spun, or including both letters on the opposite ends of the pointer.&#10;&#10;"

Players have a choice of either moving units or drawing a card that will dictate what the player must do. The card may benefit or penalize them.&#10;&#10;Units are placed on the map's intersections, so every unit usually has six directions in which it can move in. You can capture (i.e. remove from the board) enemy units by encircling them. Any enemy unit(s) isolated by your own units or immobilized (no exit paths available) is automatically removed from the board.&#10;&#10;The edge of the board, the shoreline for naval units and the waterfront for land units all count toward the capturing rule if they can't escape.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either player occupies the opponent's Capital on the board or when the Supreme Command unit is encircled by enemy units.&#10;&#10;"
