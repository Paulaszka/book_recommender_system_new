This game consists of two separate decks of cards: one of 28 Pitching cards and the other of 30 Hitting/Fielding cards. Also included are a small glossy baseball diamond and scoring box, erasable crayons for marking the score and wooden discs for baserunners.&#10;&#10;To play, the Pitching cards are shuffled and placed face down between the players. The Hitting/Fielding cards are shuffled, and each player is dealt a hand of five. The batting player must discard and replace any Pickoff card, while the fielding player must discard and replace any Error card.&#10;&#10;For each turn, the fielding player turns over the top Pitching card, which shows either a Ball, a green Fastball, blue Curve, yellow Changeup or a red Slider. The Batting player draws a card from Hitting/Fielding deck and then must try to play a card that matches the color of the pitch. Each of these cards has a number from 1 to 4. The fielding player then draws a card from the Hitting/Fielding deck and tries to match the color of the hitting card. A color match with a number equal to or higher than the batting card is an out; if the fielding card is lower, the difference is the number of bases hit/advanced. A card that doesn't match in color counts as a zero.&#10;&#10;The batting player may use an Error card to automatically advance the batter and all runners by one base. The fielding player may use a Pick Off card to remove a runner on base. A fielding card 2 higher than the batting card is a double play if a runner is on first; 3 higher allows a double play of any two runners.&#10;&#10;"

The goal each day is to collect enough cards within your ranch in an attempt to reach the total value needed for that day, without going over. This seems simple enough, but other players will attempt to sabotage your ranch, using animals, babies, sunlight and darkness to scare, chase, overpopulate, and even eat things within your ranch.&#10;&#10;Setup:&#10;Deal a Player Starting Card, face-up, to each player. Set the matching player score markers on the Start/Finish space of the game board. Shuffle the 60- card play deck and place it face down on the game board in the space labeled &ldquo;Draw.&rdquo; Randomly determine the first starting player, who will also deal. The starting player changes each day, rotating clockwise.&#10;&#10;Play:&#10;At the beginning of each day, roll the 10-sided die and set it in in a position where all can see. Add 10 to this die roll. This is the target value your ranch needs to obtain for the day. For example: If a 7 is rolled, the target value for the day is 17.&#10;&#10;The starting player deals 1 card face-up into each player&rsquo;s ranch and 2 cards face-down to each player&rsquo;s hand. A player&rsquo;s hand is always hidden from other players.&#10;&#10;Ranch:&#10;The initial face-up card dealt to each player is set directly to the right of the Player Starting Cards. This signifies the beginning of each player&rsquo;s ranch. The card directly to the right of the Player Starting Cards is always protected. This means that it cannot be removed by effects of other players but may be removed by a player&rsquo;s own effect. Any card played on a person&rsquo;s ranch is placed to the right of all the cards currently in that player&rsquo;s ranch. Whenever cards are removed, the remaining cards slide left to fill in any gaps.&#10;&#10;Actions:&#10;When it is your turn, you can perform 1 of the following 4 actions:&#10;1. Play a card of any color into your own ranch. This card is placed to the right of all the cards currently in your ranch. If the card has an effect, the current player may resolve the effect but is not required to do so.&#10;2. Play a card into an opponent&rsquo;s ranch that matches the color of that player&rsquo;s starting card or the color of a card already in that player&rsquo;s ranch. This card is placed to the right of all the cards currently in that player&rsquo;s ranch. If the card has an effect, the current player may resolve the effect but is not required to do so.&#10;3. Destroy your own protected card. This can only be done if you have more than 1 Playing Card in your ranch. When the protected card is destroyed, the remaining cards slide left while the new leftmost ranch card next to your Player Starting Card becomes the new protected card.&#10;4. Discard a card. This allows you to draw a new card and also speeds up the current day.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you draw back up to two cards.&#10;&#10;Special Rules:&#10;If a player plays a card in their own ranch that matches a color already in their ranch, they may choose to destroy their own leftmost (protected) card as part of the play.&#10;&#10;Some card effects remove other cards from a ranch. When these effects resolve, the player playing the card chooses the target. The target can be a card in ANY player&rsquo;s ranch, not just the ranch of the player where the card was played. The target card may not be a protected card or the card immediately to the left of a special Moon card. Important: The player playing the card is not required to resolve any card effect and may choose to ignore that effect.&#10;&#10;The following keywords all remove cards into the discard pile:&#10;&bull; Scare&#10;&bull; Chase&#10;&bull; Destroy&#10;&bull; Eat&#10;&bull; Stalk&#10;&bull; Stomp&#10;&#10;Ending a Day:&#10;As cards are removed or discarded, they are collected in a discard pile in the center of the game board. When the number of cards in the discard pile equals twice the number of players in the game, the day ends. For example: In a 3-player game, the day ends when the 6th card is placed in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;When the day is over, the player with the highest ranch value, without going over the target value for the day, scores 1 point for each player they beat. In addition, each other player also scores 1 point for each player that they beat, so position at the end of each day is important. Players that exceed the target total when the day ends score no points.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;A standard game is played up to 15 points. When a player exceeds 15 points at the end of a day, the game is over, and the highest total (or tie for highest) is the winner. In the case of a tie, the players may share the victory or may play an additional day as a tiebreaker.&#10;&#10;2-Player Rules:&#10;When playing with 2 players, it is recommended to not end a day until 6 cards have been removed or discarded instead of 4.&#10;&#10;"

Discovering that ragtag teams of utterly horrible musicians have been sneaking in and using the theatre for practice sessions, he decides to put every last remaining bit of his fortune into organising a tournament and invites these completely untalented teams to participate. They would be challenged to perform various musical scores in an extremely short amount of time. This is deliberate just so the true talents will be quickly picked out from the rest. The winning group shall hence be personally groomed by the Grand Dean himself into a world class orchestra team, where they would properly represent the currently dysfunct Theatre and make it famous again!&#10;&#10;You are ringleaders of your own groups of musicians, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become famous. Starting from a skeleton crew of horrendous talents, you will grow in strength and ultimately evolve into a mighty orchestra fit for any world stage.&#10;&#10;Cantabile Blitz is played in Stages, which are then broken down into Performances. Every player starts off with the same set of basic dice, each die representing a musician of one type of instrument. At the end of every performance, the Grand Dean will reward better performing groups with more cash, which in turn allows them to recruit better and more musicians into their team. This is represented by more types of dice, eventually reaching a fully fleshed out orchestra. There are no turns in this game, and the actual musical performances are in real time. As soon as a musical score even remotely resembles its original tune by any of the groups' plays, the group can quickly submit their recording to the Grand Dean. However, the group that submits the score and ends that performance does not necessarily always win that round. They do have bonus points for doing so, but other bands might have raked up more points by completing more segments in the music sheet!&#10;&#10;"

You returned from the banks of the Styx feeling that you could now enjoy summer life with more treks and more beaches...but you can't relax just yet. Fate doesn't like when people tamper with her whims, and the angel of Death is stretching his hands towards you slowly but surely. Will you be able to escape his clutches for another week? It's a desperate, shared struggle for survival.&#10;&#10;Final Deathweek is a cooperative card game. Players hold cards that symbolize &quot;death flags&quot; (death warnings) of certain colors. Each turn, each player in order must select one of the available events for the day, trying to NOT match the colors of the event with the color(s) they have in hand. While not matching colors, they should also try to form chains with the events they take. If the colors do match, the player takes damage, eventually being killed if too much damage is taken.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for seven days, and if all players survive, they beat the game.&#10;&#10;"

There are 8 rounds in the game also known as Sabbats from the Celtic Wheel of the Year. During a turn a Druid must build a glade of the forest and then perform actions by himself or with the help of a summoned animal. Druids must try to Enchant a Glade to earn Spirit points. Glades that have less purity than others will earn more Spirit points. Each druid that creates a Triad (3 adjacent glades with their own enchantment) will score Spirit Points. Depending on the position of The Wheel of the Year, glade enchanting may prove difficult. Certain glades are also abundant with Druidic Magick; swiping other&rsquo;s enchantments, using magical bursts, or summoning forest animals for assistance, to name a few. The more the game is played, players will come up with new strategies and new ideas on how to best earn Spirit. Each game will create a random layout of the forest, never knowing which glades will be present that game. And you never know what changing events the Drachnel Forest will unleash - so be certain to store up your Mind Power to use only when needed. The druid with the most Spirit Points after one year, wins!&#10;&#10;"

Real-life Genetically Modified Organisms are intermingled with bizarre, advanced innovations to create a card game filled with laughs, debate, and fantasy.&#10;&#10;G.M.O.ooh!&rsquo;s key game mechanic involves debating the merits of the futuristic Organisms across a many of dimensions.  These unique factors lead to one-of-a-kind, creative discussions.  Only one G.M.O.ooh! Card survives per round.  The player with the last remaining G.M.O.ooh! Card wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each G.M.O.ooh! Card is a futuristic genetically modified organism, including background information and data on 5 Categories.  Each Category has a Description and a Rating number.  The Categories are Profit, Cost, Environmental Impact, Demand, and Risk.&#10;&#10;Each Challenge Card allows a player to Challenge and overtake the Current Leader.  Red Challenge Cards involve adding or subtracting Rating points or changing the Category.  Blue Challenge Cards allow the player to debate the Current Leader across 11 Debate types: Category Challenge (5 different Categories), Survive, Mate, Sales Pitch, Danger, Act, Fight, Outsmart, Race, Outgrow, and Looks.&#10;&#10;This description primarily covers the Basic Game.  The full details of the Advanced Game version are included in the instruction booklet.&#10;&#10;Setup: Deal all of the G.M.O.ooh! Cards face down to each player.  This is the players Stack.  Players do not look at the cards in their stack until the top card is played.  Deal 3 Challenge Cards to each player face down.  Players can hold and view their Challenge Cards and also replenish up to 3 after each round.  The Dealer starts with the Current Leader Dial and the Dealer Button.  The Current Leader Dial acts as a scorekeeper for the Category and Rating within the current round and also denotes who the Current Leader is.&#10;&#10;Each round within a game includes 2 phases: G.M.O.ooh! Card phase and Challenge Card phase.&#10;&#10;G.M.O.ooh! Card phase &ndash; This phase establishes the Current Leader.  The dealer introduces the G.M.O.ooh! Card, choses a Category, and states the Rating.  All players then reveal their Rating in that Category.  The player with the highest rating in the Category chosen becomes the Current Leader and announces their Card if necessary.&#10;&#10;Challenge Card Phase &ndash; Starting clockwise, the Current Leader then Checks for Challenges.  Players can then play a Challenge Card to attempt to become the new Current Leader.  There is a limit of 1 Challenge per player per round.&#10;&#10;Red Challenge Cards may result in an immediate change of Current Leader.&#10;&#10;Blue Challenge Cards require a debate.  The Challenger first states their case, the Current Leader then defends.  A final phase allows all players at the table to ask questions or lobby before all players vote.&#10;&#10;Voters should consider creative use of data provided on each G.M.O.ooh! Card when casting their vote.&#10;&#10;The Challenger must have at least 1 extra vote (A tie goes to the Current Leader).  The Challenge Phase then continues clockwise until all players have had 1 chance to Challenge.  A feature in the Advanced Game version allows players to pass and still Challenge in the same round.&#10;&#10;The Current Leader when all challenges have been exhausted or one full pass around the table has been completed wins the round and moves their G.M.O.ooh! Card to their Winners Pile.  All losers in the round discard their G.M.O.ooh! Card to the Losers Pile in the center of the table.  In the Advanced Game version, players can Steal or Re-incarnate lost G.M.O.ooh! Cards using Yellow Challenge Cards.&#10;&#10;Pass the Dealer Button to the left and continue with a new round.  When a player&rsquo;s Stack is depleted, their shuffled Winners Pile becomes their new Stack.  A player is out of the game when they lose their last G.M.O.ooh! Card.&#10;&#10;The player with the last remaining G.M.O.ooh! Card wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
