You'll do this by collecting sets of cards with matching location icons. Each time you collect a set of 3 cards that all have the same icon, you get to place a tag on a hex with that icon anywhere on the map.&#10;&#10;The game is played over 3 rounds and there are no turns! Once a round has started everyone takes their actions at the same time in any order they choose. There are 5 main actions:&#10;- Draw a card: Draw the top card from any draw pile into your hand.&#10;- Add to a set: Play a card from your hand or from the top of the share pile onto a set pile on your crew mat.&#10;- Share a card: Play a card from your hand onto a share pile that is empty or has the matching color or icon on top.&#10;- Complete a set: Clear a set of 3 cards from your crew mat and place a tag on a matching map hex.&#10;- Rush a set: Take a cop car token to clear an incomplete set and place a tag on a matching map hex.&#10;&#10;The end of the round is triggered either when all draw piles are empty or once only 1 player has tags remaining on their map. Each player gets 6 crew tags from the supply and another round commences. The game ends after 3 rounds and you'll score for objectives and for each map hex where you have a tag AND lose points for cop cars and solo tags. The crew with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"
