Players take charge of Japan or the Qing Dynasty and fight for control of the Korean Peninsula, Liaodong Peninsula, Shandong Peninsula, and Penghu Islands. Alternatively, the Japanese Army can challenge the Zhili decisive battle.&#10;&#10;As with historical facts, the Navy has a big role to play in games. At that time, the infrastructure was not well-developed, and it was the transport vessels that could most efficiently carry large numbers of troops and supplies, and command of the sea was needed to secure maritime transport. How will the Combined Fleet challenge the Beiyang Fleet, which has the battleships Dingyuan and Zhenyuan, which were called the strongest ships in the Orient? And how will the Japanese Army capture the fortress of Lushun and Weihaiwei?&#10;&#10;The game system of this game is called card-driven, and makes full use of cards that represent war resources and historical events and tactics. But more important than how to use the card is a &quot;strategy&quot; that looks at how to end the war.&#10;&#10;"

Your deck is built around an Outfit, one of the six main groups attempting to control Deadwood.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved via poker hands.  Deciding who goes first  is decided by drawing the top five cards from your deck and the lowest poker hands go first.&#10;&#10;Players take one action each, in turn which can include:&#10;&#10;     Hiring a new dude (getting you influence in town)&#10;     Purchasing a new deed (getting you control in town)&#10;     Shopping for gear for your dudes&#10;     Start a shootout with your opponents to try to remove their influence.&#10;&#10;&#10;When each player passes, you reach &quot;Sundown&quot; for the day.

Changing the set up of the Town means that the game has more variability over time as districts advantage different candidates. Players are also assigned purple 'values' cards, which they share with the players next to them. This means you have things in common but, in a 4 player game, have nothing in common with the person sitting across from you! Values are important: your candidates perform better if they have the same values and your projects give you more legacy points if they also align with your values.&#10;&#10;Once the Town is established and the districts chosen, players select cards (their candidates and inventory) and begin building up their arsenal for the upcoming elections. Be sure to select good candidates! They come with one or more Persuasive (P), Strategic (S) or Ruthless (R) skills which determines the number and type of actions they can make as candidates and later on as councillors.&#10;&#10;Each district is up for election and players spend resources trying to ensure their candidate comes out as the winner. Players adopt the persona of their candidate and give a short 'campaign speech' to the table, outlining why they deserve your vote. The player with the &quot;best speech&quot; wins additional support which increases their odds of being elected. Support is also increased by the candidate's popularity in that district and any other cards you burn to give you a competitive edge. Be careful: the more you burn now, the less you can do once you're in Town Hall! Each candidate elected is worth legacy points, which decide the game.&#10;&#10;Winning candidates become councillors who can complete project in their term of office if they have the necessary skills (P, S or R). Complete a project and get more legacy points. Diversity is key: players are rewarded bonus points for a complete PSR set of 3. At the end of 3 rounds the player with the highest number of legacy points is the winner! For experienced players, there is the option to include an add-on mode where the Mayor of the day tries to persuade players to support their proposal.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

As faithful agents, you must work together to uncover and eliminate all the traitors.&#10;&#10;Infiltraitors is a challenging deduction card game with twenty missions. Suspect cards are set aside at the start; these are the traitors who must be identified by suit and numbers. Players must manage their hands to give clues on the suspect cards. Clues may match with a traitor by having the same suit or where the number is either a multiple or a factor of the traitor's.&#10;&#10;As the clues accumulate, players may deduce the identity of a traitor card, but can you catch them all before the time runs out?&#10;&#10;"

By occupying settlements in battles, players gain points that they can use to develop their army and settle free territory. Each nation has its own characteristics, so on the road to victory, everyone must use a slightly different strategy. The winner is the player who has the largest territory at the end of the game, but the victory can be sided with the occupation of a strategic place or the size of the army.&#10;&#10;"
