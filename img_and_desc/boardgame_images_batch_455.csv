It was the first major battle of the Hundred Years War, and although it was a naval encounter &ndash; the English fleet attacked their French adversaries in the estuary before Bruges &ndash; it was decided by sword, hammer and arrow. Confined to cog and barge, retreat was not an option for marines in this desperate fight. Despite being outnumbered and in foreign waters, the English fleet annihilated its adversary. Edward captured nearly all his rival&rsquo;s ships and slew a horde of soldiers and mariners that day, boasting that bodies were washing onto Flemish beaches for days.&#10;&#10;Designed by Jeremy White, this is an unusual game. Players &ldquo;build&rdquo; the battlefield as they go. By navigating their squadrons of galleys, nefs and cogs through the estuary they create the &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; upon which the knights and men-at-arms will vie for supremacy. Success hinges on the ability to deliver marines and archers against weak points, or in giving your opponent no choice but to hit your fleet where it is strongest. The English will have the longbow and a high freeboard, as well as the benefit of the wind gauge in many scenarios, but if played smartly the French will manage to offset those advantages, applying his weight of numbers irresistibly against the English king&rsquo;s bid to rule France. Scenarios treat the variety of questions that puzzle historians about this battle, and since the game is not complex and plays under three hours, it offers a chance to explore many angles of historical interpretation.&#10;&#10;Right Fierce &amp; Terrible has one 22 by 34 inch map, oversized die cut counters, accessible rules with extensive illustrated examples of play, and seven scenarios with set-up diagrams for a quick start. Regardless of the scenario played, however, casualties will be horrendous, and there are tough decisions to make. Archery, ramming, grappling and melee are the tools of conquest here. The battle is likely to ebb and flow, squadrons can be captured, liberated, and captured again. Leaders, including King Edward, can also be captured and liberated, or killed by a stray arrow, or if nabbed, executed on the spot. Would Edward&rsquo;s demise have spared Flanders and France one hundred years of war? Knights can perform acts of heroism to avert disaster, but at great cost to themselves. Each fleet&rsquo;s morale will gradually deteriorate as the battle grows more desperate&hellip;until at last, one fleet finally breaks and the day is won!&#10;&#10;"

Building trilithons and preparing the altar stone may assist along the way and it is vital that you keep up with the necessary preparations to avoid offending the spirits.&#10;Getting Started&#10;&#10;Equipment: First Druid uses all of the pieces provided in the basic game box. Each player uses the pieces of one colour (along with the trilithon card of his or her colour), so if there are less than five players some colours will not be used.&#10;&#10;Throughout these rules, the plastic figures are referred to as 'druids'.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game&#10;&#10;When the first player has moved his druid all the way around the ring, the game is at an end. Merely streaking ahead is not enough to secure victory, however; it is the support and alleigances secured along the way that decide which druid is the First Druid!&#10;&#10;Each player has as many points as the number his druid piece is on at the end, plus additional points for allied tribes and spirits. Tribes and Spirits count 1 point for the first in a run, 2 for the second, 3 for the third etc.&#10;&#10;So, the game is a complex balance of using your magical powers to race ahead and gaining allies. In addition, trilothon stones enhance your supply of magic, and dressing the alter stone may move you ahead or even move your rivals backwards!&#10;&#10;"

Besides making you dizzy, you would have to deal with wind, rain, and perhaps huge monolithic rocks magicly moved in your way by powerful wizards. The Olympic Games of ancient Greece came to mind. Granted we still have Olympic Games, but they are much tamer than the win or die type games of the original Olympics. What if the Celts also had a version of these games. Stonehenge would make a perfect field for such a competition. Start by running along the tops of the outer ring while trying to keep your balance, especially in strong winds.

In Bright Got 'Em you outsmart and corner your opponents through savvy card play, sly movement, and clever placement of blocking walls. In the still-casual, but even-trickier Brainy Got 'Em! you toss aside card actions in favor of a purely strategic challenge.&#10;&#10;Both games share the same goal, the same exciting intrigue, and the same social fun. &#10;Place walls to trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours!&#10;&#10;Surround yourself with friends and family. Get ready to enjoy mroe fun than any four walls could ever contain! It's time you Got 'Em!&#10;Play Summary:&#10;The goal: trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours. Last pawn free wins!&#10;&#10;Bright Got 'Em! (use colored side of the board)&#10;In Bright Got 'Em!, each player starts with 3 cards and pawn. Place your pawn on the same-colored start square (one of the four squares at the corners of the board's center square). The player who's birthday is closest, goes first.&#10;&#10;On your turn you will play a card, following each rule in the order they appear. Most cards have 2 instructions. The first tells you where you can place a wall and the second how many square you can move your pawn.&#10;&#10;Wall Placement Rules:&#10;Walls can only be placed along one edge of a square, between two squares.&#10;When a player's pawn is trapped by walls in a single square, that player is eliminated from the game. The edge of the board counts as a wall.&#10;There are a few cards that allow you to remove a wall or pass through a wall. However, you have to play these cards before your pawn is trapped! &#10;Once your pawn is trapped in a single square, you're out and your pawn is removed from the board.&#10;When you trap another player's pawn, thus eliminating him from the game, you may remove any 1 wall from the board.&#10;&#10;Moving Your Pawn&#10;Most cards allow you to move your pawn up to a specific number of squares.&#10;You can't move through walls, unless you play a card that allows it.&#10;You can't move through a square occupied by another pawn.&#10;You may only move orthogonally, never diagonally.&#10;You can stay where you are.&#10;You don't have to move the exact number of squares listed on the card. You can move fewer squares if you want.&#10;You can move zig zag, first in one direction, then in another, just not diagonally up to the number of squares specified on the card you played.&#10;&#10;After placing a wall and moving (or not), discard the card you played and draw another. (You should always have 3 cards in your hand.) Play passes to the player on your left.&#10;&#10;The last player to have a pawn on the board wins!&#10;&#10;Brainy Got 'Em! (use white side of board)&#10;You don't need any cards for this version. The goal is the same: trap your opponents' pawns while illuding capture yourself.&#10;&#10;On your turn, place a wall anywhere on the board, then move your pawn.&#10;The number of squares you can move your pawn is equal to 1 plus the number of walls on your square. You may place a wall on the square your pawn occupies to increase your pawn's movement on the same turn.&#10;&#10;All other rules are the same as Bright Got 'Em!&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 double-sided game board (Bright Got 'Em! on one side, Brainy Got 'Em! on the other), 84 wall pieces, 55 Got 'Em! cards, 4 pawns, game rules.&#10;&#10;"
