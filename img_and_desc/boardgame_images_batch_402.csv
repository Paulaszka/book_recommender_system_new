There are no multi-year question cards now - all have six answers from a single year going back to Ancient times.&#10;&#10;"

Passive watching / reading of a detective story turns into a dynamic boardgame, in which the players engage in searching out the evidence and investigating the complexity of the murderer's motives.  &#10;Each session is a contest of skill between the detectives and the Master of the Game in the role of the Prime Suspect. Exactly what happened and how? Who is the murderer and what was the motive of the crime? The choice is far from easy. Among the twenty suspects are respected citizens of Vileburg. Step by step the detectives follow the murderer's trail, carefully checking each trace, searching out anyone in any way connected with the case. The witnesses (once identified) are ready to testify. Their statements may help or further complicate the process of investigation. In this game everything depends on the deductive skills of the players: no one else will put together all the pieces of the puzzle into one coherent and logical picture.  And even when (and if) the criminal is finally caught (after the exciting chase phase of the game), it&rsquo;s not over yet: the detectives try to deduct the motive of the crime, reconstruct the entire story from the scraps of data they have managed to collect.&#10;&#10;"

You send out your staff to draft players, sell tickets, build a new stadium or other features, sell sponsorships, buy equipment, hire staff, and even organize a cheerleading staff.  Components consist of 10 blocks per player that represent staff.  A main board--where your staff is placed to perform actions.  A player board--where you keep track of money, wins, equipment, unhired staff etc., A building board, where you place blocks to build luxury suites, sponsored consessions, and stuff like that--this is also where you get victory points.  And also on that building board is where players go to the playoffs, championship, and the big bowl game.  The games goes until one player has placed all 10 blocks (two are already vice presidents and their staff, and you can assign more blocks to represent staff if you can pay them enough)--usually 60-90 minutes.  Wooden tokens with one black side which change depending on block placement determine whether there will be a game (where you need to pay staff and players) and whether there will be a loss (equipment breaks, players get injured).&#10;&#10;"

The player who goes out scores zero points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their cards.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing cards on multiple rows, however, players play onto a single discard stack, with the played card being higher than the top card of the stack but not more than ten higher; if you can&rsquo;t (or don't want to) play a card within this ten point range, you have to pick up the discard pile. Ergo, &quot;11 takes&quot;. You then start two new stacks by revealing cards from the top of the deck. The number of piles keeps growing throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Each time you take a stack with more than three cards, you get a bull card. With bull cards, you can play additional cards on your turn as long as all the cards fall within that ten point spread. For each bull card you can play on one different stack.&#10;&#10;"
