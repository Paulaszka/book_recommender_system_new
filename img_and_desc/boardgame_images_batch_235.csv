The mauled stream makes a desultory attack on the target city, scattering much of their payload of high explosive and incendiaries harmlessly into the surrounding countryside. Then the raid struggles back towards England while fresh formations of nightfighters snap and bite at the retreating formation. More than ninety bombers fail to make it home safely. Soon afterward, the C-in-C of Bomber Command, Arthur &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, calls off the Battle of Berlin.&#10;&#10;BOMBER COMMAND is a game of the night war in the skies over the Reich in World War II.&#10;The game recreates the great RAF bombing raids against the heart of Germany and the defence of the German Luftwaffe's night fighter arm.&#10;&#10;Based on an air combat system derived from the award-winning Downtown and The Burning Blue 'raid-scale' games, Bomber Command details the tactics of night fighting.&#10;&#10;The German player must manage flak, Himmelbett zones, Wild Boar and Tame Boar tactics. RAF 'main force' raids are supported by Mosquito diversions, &quot;Gardening&quot; operations (mining of seaways) and decoy raids. Two card decks--one for each player--are used to resolve the complex interactions of electronic countermeasures and radars, along with other operational factors such as Mahmoud patrols, Flower raids, and Beleuchter illumination units. A detailed bombing resolution system depicts the difficulties of marking targets and area bombing at night.&#10;&#10;There are two scenarios:&#10;&#10;1. Berlin covers raiding from the 1943 Hamburg firestorm to the great Battle of Berlin and the RAF's defeat over Nuremburg in March 1944.&#10;&#10;2. Downfall recreates the period from the Summer of 1944 to the collapse of the Luftwaffe in the face of fuel shortages and the RAF's &quot;bomber support&quot; effort.&#10;&#10;The game is fast-playing and raids typically resolve in 2 hours or less.&#10;&#10;"

The city sites are placed at the intersection of hexagonal pieces which have numbers on them, and each turn dice are rolled and cities adjacent to pieces with the rolled numbers produce resources, just as in CATAN. Also as in Settlers, players trade resources with each other and then use them to build roads and bridges. Unlike Settlers, Twin Cities uses three dice with 1-5 and a question mark on the faces; rolling question marks gives you action cards, and rolling certain combinations has special effects.&#10;&#10;Game contents include:&#10;12 city pieces&#10;66 interlocking plastic board pieces&#10;8 board frame pieces&#10;360 resource cards&#10;85 action cards&#10;72 road pieces&#10;24 bridge pieces&#10;3 dice&#10;1 board piece bag&#10;&#10;"

They are aimed at gamers who wish to experience a large scale battle at the battalion level. Players command Corps and Divisions, and maneuver by brigade, regiment or battalion. Avoiding the usual omnipresent control that players are so often allowed over the minutiae of battle, Le Feu Sacr&eacute; concentrates on encouraging historically correct grand tactics. Also included are historical orders of battle for 8 example Corps d'Armee.&#10;&#10;The rules use the familiar TooFatLardies card driven system. The Lardies' emphasis on battlefield &quot;friction&quot; allows the better, bolder generals to take the initiative, and recover from unexpected reverses, whilst less competent, cautious commanders need to stick to predictable battle plans, or risk coming unstuck. We present to you a set of rules where Austrian troops can be the equal of the French, but the Empire can still repeat history! Vive l'Empereur!&#10;&#10;"
