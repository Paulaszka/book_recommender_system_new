These groups manipulate and influence the citizens of the Community in an effort to join their side and vanquish the opposition.&#10;&#10;Each Faction uses movement and control to turn the tide against their opposition. By expanding influence over the Community, power can be acquired. Choose a side and become the Master of Wills.&#10;&#10;Master of Wills can be played one-versus-one or two-versus-two. It&rsquo;s all about moving the cards&mdash;you want to move as many points to your side of the board as possible while your opponent is trying to do the same for their side. Community cards are each assigned a value, and each card is represented by a character from one of the eight sectors of the Community. Moving those cards can trigger the basic movement of other cards on the board.&#10;&#10;The cards move from a neutral area in the middle of the board toward your side or the opponent&rsquo;s side through three rows. Each row represents how close the character is to joining your Faction. The rows are called Recruits, Loyalists, and Allies. Each row represents how loyal the character is to your side. If they reach your Allies, those points are locked in.&#10;&#10;When the game begins, each player will choose a Faction and build a deck of Faction cards that caters to their own style. These Faction cards allow for even more powerful card movement. For instance, let&rsquo;s say you choose a Faction card that says, &ldquo;Choose any card from your opponent&rsquo;s Recruits or Loyalists and move to your Allies.&rdquo; Then imagine your opponent has a card with a 15-point value in their Loyalists row. You can snatch up that valuable card and lock it into the Allies row on your side of the board, giving you a large number of points and taking those same points away from the opponent. A single, well-timed Faction card can be a serious game changer.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Armies from across Europe would ally with these families, spreading combat as far from Gascony as Scotland and Portugal. Chivalry rose and fell on the backs of personalities like the Black Prince, Charles the Bad, and Pedro the Cruel, fought over battlefields at Cre&ccedil;y, Poitiers, and Agincourt. By the end of this period, the military code of chivalry would be in ashes and from those would be born the nations of England and France.&#10;&#10;Chivalry At Bay is a low to medium complexity game depicting many of the individual battles that made up the Hundred Years War. Players control armies involved in each conflict that attempt to drive their opponent from the field of battle. Each battle can be completed in roughly two hours, allowing several battles to be played in a single sitting. The game takes several novel approaches toward simulating these eighteen individual battles:&#10;&#10;LA CAPELLE (HYPOTHETICAL) - 23 October 1339&#10;SAINT-OMER - 26 July 1340&#10;MORLAIX - 30 September 1342&#10;AUBEROCHE - 21 October 1345&#10;BLANCHETAQUE - 24 August 1346&#10;CRE&Ccedil;Y - 26 August 1346&#10;NEVILLE&rsquo;S CROSS - 17 October 1346&#10;CASSEL - 8 June 1347&#10;B&Eacute;THUNE - 13 June 1347&#10;POITIERS - 19 September 1356&#10;COCHEREL - 16 May 1364&#10;AURAY - 29 September 1364&#10;NAJERA - 3 April 1367&#10;PONTVALLAIN - 4 December 1370&#10;ROOSEBEKE - 27 November 1382&#10;ALJUBARROTA - 14 August 1385&#10;HUMBLETON HILL - 14 September 1402&#10;AGINCOURT - 25 October 1415&#10;&#10;Rather than the typical hex-based movement system, Chivalry At Bay uses a map that is broken up into three individual columns (or &quot;battles&quot; to use the historical term), each of which is made up of five &quot;ranks&quot; ranging from a friendly rear area, to and advance area, central area, through the enemy advance and rear areas. Units move backwards and forwards through these areas to more accurately simulate the type of movement that took place historically as waves of knights and men-at-arms advanced and were thrown back by enemy defenders (such as the feared English bowmen). Special terrain tiles may be placed in specific areas to more accurately simulate the ground over which the armies fought.&#10;&#10;Combat is a simple process involving a &quot;buckets-of-dice&quot; system where &quot;hits&quot; on enemy units are based upon a unit's ability rating. Units range from lowly levies to the cream of chivalry, the French knight. Also represented are long bowmen, crossbowmen, men-at-arms, bill and pikemen, and light cavalry. Units that take hits may withdraw towards their friendly areas or hold their position and be ground down by the enemy onslaught. Units that have sustained enough damage may rout from the field!&#10;&#10;&#10;The core of the game system is a deck of action cards. Each card provides a random number of command points that army leaders use to activate units on the battlefield to advance into engagement or withdraw before they're destroyed. The number of cards a player has available is based upon the quality of the army leadership. Several of these cards also allow the opportunity for players to &quot;purchase&quot; temporary army enhancements such as increased unit ratings or combat bonuses or even events that can shift the momentum of a battle.&#10;&#10;In addition to the eighteen historical battles depicted, Chivalry At Bay provides players the ability to quickly and easily create their own custom armies to experiment with tactics and fight out battles on their own terms.&#10;&#10;From La Capelle to Agincourt, relive the blood and glory of the Hundred Years War with Chivalry At Bay!&#10;&#10;SUN OF YORK OWNERS!

It is primarily a naval-air conflict, with some elements of power projection using ground forces. The game map represents various sea zones (or zones) within the Mediterranean, as well as adjoining land areas. Critical bases for both sides, including neutral nations are also depicted.&#10;&#10;Aircraft units represent one to six squadrons, with the counter displaying the primary type of aircraft. Ship units represent one fleet aircraft carrier or battleship and &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; of four cruisers or nuclear-powered submarines with destroyers being represented in squadrons of six to eight destroyers or non-nuclear subs. Other ship types are represented at the division level and represent various numbers of ship types. On the map, each inch equals 20 miles. Each turn represents from one day to one week of activity, depending on the level of activity. Sixth Fleet is based on Red Dragon Rising. Changes have been made based on the situation in the Mediterranean during the Cold War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The solitaire player is commanding the US forces and the system controls the Japanese forces. The player wins by accomplishing historic campaign milestones ahead of what was done historically, thereby opening the way for an earlier invasion of Okinawa or Formosa. Most ground units represent divisions, brigades or regiments. Aircraft units represent two groups or regiments (six to eight squadrons), and are each identified by the primary type of aircraft in those units. Ship units represent one fleet aircraft carrier, divisions of two light or escort carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, squadrons of six to eight destroyers and one light cruiser. The map is drawn to emphasize the strategically critical zones and islands in the Central Pacific. Each grid box on the map is 300 miles from side to side. Each turn represents one month.&#10;&#10;"

The player actively commands the German forces, while the rules system directs you in the handling of Soviet forces. The system allows the player to plan and execute his advance towards Moscow with the Soviet defending forces being randomly created in each hex dependent on the terrain. You win or lose, ultimately, based on the timely seizure of key areas on the map. Each game turn equals one or two weeks. Each hexagon represents 7.5 miles (12 km) from side to opposite side.&#10;&#10;Though designed for solitaire play, Operation Typhoon is easily adaptable to cooperative team play. One person can administratively handle the Soviets while the other actively commands the German force. Alternatively, one player can command the three northern German armies and panzer groups while the other commands the three southern formations. The game map represents the terrain in the operational area of Moscow, with each unit representing the historical German divisions and generic randomly generated Soviet defending forces.&#10;&#10;Uses the Panzers East solitaire system.&#10;&#10;World at War #65, April-May 2019&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
