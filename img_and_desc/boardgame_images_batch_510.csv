The amount on the card is subtracted from the players score, which (by agreement) can be 101, 201, or 301. To win a player had to hit exactly 0 with the last shot, AND the last card played should be a 'double'.&#10;&#10;In the more advanced game the player is allowed to open as many 'pile' as he likes, but scores negative points for unfinished piles.&#10;&#10;"

These are randomly chosen and placed by all players when starting the game. A hole is impassable, but a twist allows a player to twist any snake piece on the board. This can change things considerably! The cross is an intersection that ends all snakes that touch it.&#10;&#10;Twisted Tails was created by Kevin Kulp and J. Tagmire at the 2012 Global Game Jam.
