The one who is able to present the sultan the most expensive collection of jewels has proven that he is skilful enough to manage the sultan&acute;s fortune and will win the hand of his daughter. In Sultan the players take the role of candidates to win the hand of the sultan&acute;s daughter. Who will be able to pass the test under the eyes of the stern sultan?&#10;&#10;"

It was produced by Toy Creations Inc. of New York, and a signed dedication inside the box lid promised to donate all royalties to charity.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 144 thick cardboard tiles: 48 states divided into four color-coded regions; 48 state capitols; 30 primary industries; 10 &quot;favorite sons&quot;; and 8 American flags (wild cards). There are four cardboard racks for holding each player's tiles (neatly designed to create red-and-white stripes when laid sideways in the box next to the blue-starred covered rules).&#10;&#10;The tiles are shuffled face down on the table between the players. Each player draws a hand of 12 tiles to start. Each in turn then draws a tile and then discards a tile (the same or another). As in mah-jong, the player must announce the discard. The next player may pick up either the discard or a blind tile, but any player may claim the discard if it completes a partial set. He must reveal enough tiles to prove the set (e.g. two other states of the same color), thus revealing part of his strategy, but play then passes to the seizing player's left, with any in between missing their turns.&#10;&#10;There are eight potential scoring combinations. The easiest, scoring 5, is a hand with three states in each of the four regions. The most difficult, scoring 30, requires three states each with their capitols, one of their industries and a favorite son. (Since some industries have only a single tile, and only 10 states have favorite sons, this can be very difficult indeed.) However, the 8 American flag tiles can be used as wild cards.&#10;&#10;If a player needs information (such as a state's favorite son or industry), he may ask questions out loud, and pays 5 into a bonus pot for each question. As soon as a player completes a winning hand, he calls &quot;America&quot; and collects the value of the hand from each player as well as anything in the bonus pot. Cardboard discs in four colors are supplied, with their values to be assigned by the players.&#10;&#10;"

The game, first published in 1916, has cards with objects on them, a gavel, and some coins. At the start of the game the cards are dealt and the coins distributed evenly. One player takes the first turn at being auctioneer. He takes up the gavel and declares an item for sale from his cards. The trick is the auctioneer can only describe the item by it's number of legs. Many different items have the same number of legs, so players have to bid on the chance that they are getting the item they need, without really knowing it. The purchaser of the card becomes the new auctioneer. As players earn pairs they set them aside and are assigned a value. When all cards are exhausted the winner is the one with the most value in pairs and in coins.&#10;&#10;"

However, charging bull moose, ferocious Grizzly bear, raging rivers, ice flows and frost bite (sic) await all those who quest for gold. Only the most experienced gold-panners emerged from the wilderness unscathed with gold in their pockets. These SOURDOUGHS were the toughest of the tough, and would literally risk an entire year's earnings on the flip of a card in a poker hand.&#10;&#10;Would you be willing to bet everything you have on a bluff, or will you play it safe.

There are also spaces that can trigger a round of poker between the players - winner take all monies bet. The players must accumulate wealth enough to buy transportation to the gold fields and then find the motherlode (Big Vein). Once there, a final hand of poker is played and the person at the mine must have $500,000 remaining after the hand.&#10;&#10;The components are of high quality and it presents an interesting twist on a mundane night of poker.&#10;&#10;"
