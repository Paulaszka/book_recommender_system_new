Escape the Island is a competitive card game where each player is stranded on a &quot;deserted&quot; island.  The object of the game is to escape the island by building a raft out of Trees and Vines you can find in the Materials Deck, and collecting the required Rations.  An alternate win condition is available if you think you can &quot;hack&quot; it.  But, it's not so easy to win, as you'll be bombarded with various Crabs from the other players in an attempt to sabotage you so that they can be the first to Escape the Island.&#10;&#10;These Crabs can steal your rations and materials, sneak a peak at your hand, cause you to lose an action, and take various other actions to hinder your success.  While you may decide to smash a Crabs with your Shovel, capture them with a Crab Cage, or worse, turn them into extra Rations by boiling them in a pot of water, every action/reaction you take will likely expose you to a worse outcome.  So, choose wisely!&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt 5 cards, and can take various Actions during their turn.  The number of actions you take per turn can change during gameplay, based upon what's in your Campsite, or play area.  You may play a card in your Campsite, play a Crab on another player, draw Rations, or attempt to collect Materials once you have the required tools.  There's a significant amount of decisions to be made in this game, as each Crab can be reacted to in some way.  You might choose to destroy the crab in numerous ways, capture it, redirect it to another player, or you might just deal with the punishment.&#10;&#10;Once you've fought you way through all the Crabs and have collected the required Materials and Rations, you may triumphantly take your last action and Escape the Island by raft.  Alternatively, if you have managed to locate a special tool, ration, and enough rations for the journey, you may be in position to locate the Resort on the island and Win the Game that way.  But beware, if you make a break for it, you can bet all the other players will be looking to attack you.&#10;&#10;Various Gameplay modes&#10;&#10;Outside of normal gameplay which was developed for everyone to enjoy, we've included a few methods of gameplay to keep things interesting.  Rules have been altered to account for younger players, so this really is a game for the entire family.  But, for the more avid and hardcore gamers, there are Scenarios to play out, which will affect you in different ways each time you play, or Day/Night effects of the island that are designed to keep you guessing literally every round as to what might happen next to keep you from escaping.  Are you up to the challenge of Expert Mode?&#10;&#10;"

He rules with fear and violence, and no one dares stand up to him. No one but you. Starting with nothing more than righteous indignation, you acquire the training, resources, equipment, and experience needed to take down the Nemesis and get back your life. You move in the shadows. You let nothing and no one stand in your way. You are a vigilante!&#10;&#10;Objective:&#10;In Vigilante, the goal is to become the first player to reach 40 Experience Points, then defeat the Nemesis.&#10;&#10;Player Ability Slots&#10;Your playmat lets you keep track of your progress as you complete your costume. You can have 1 Head Equipment, 1 Body Equipment, 2 Arm Equipment, and 2 Signature Moves/Weapons. If you acquire Equipment, but there is no room for it, you gain the E.P. from it, but then must decide which card will stay on your playmat. The other card is removed from the game. It also states your character bonus. This bonus can be used once every turn and represents your area of expertise.&#10;&#10;Turn Overview:&#10;Each turn you will be using your skills (dice) to increase your experience and bring you closer to facing the Nemesis. Each turn consists of three phases:&#10;1) Upkeep Phase.&#10;2) Roll Skill Dice.&#10;3) Use Skill Dice.&#10;&#10;Using Skill Dice:&#10;Once you have finished rolling your dice, you may engage them to further your plans. Dice can be used to Obtain Equipment, Steal Equipment, Discard an Equipment Card, Train, Gain Resources, trade one color of cubes for the other (Focus Intent) Obtain New Skills, or Patrol the City. You can do as many of these actions each turn as your dice will allow, in any order you want. If you cannot or do not want to perform any of these actions, you may just pass your turn.&#10;&#10;Game End&#10;The game ends as soon as one player can defeat the Nemesis. To challenge the Nemesis, you must first reach (or pass) the 40 spot on the Experience Point Track. Once this is done, you can challenge the Nemesis. You must declare that you are challenging the Nemesis at the beginning of your turn after the upkeep phase, but before rolling any dice. Move your maker off the board and place it next to the area marked &ldquo;Level One&rdquo; on the Nemesis card.&#10;&#10;To defeat the Nemesis, you must be able to overcome all three levels on their card. You do not have to overcome all three levels in the same turn. If you overcome a level, you may move your marker to the next level and end your turn. You may also press your luck and attempt to overcome another level. If you do so, you gain the reward from completing the level. You can then re-roll your dice up to three more times, but none of the equipment you&rsquo;ve used so far is refreshed. If you ever fail to complete a level, you lose all of the progress you made this turn and must move your marker back to the level it was on at the beginning of your turn.&#10;&#10;You do not have to challenge the Nemesis each turn after acquiring 40 Experience. You can still use your turns to gain more equipment, experience, or training before attempting to challenge the Nemesis.&#10;&#10;"

From this vantage the Archmage and her Order of Mages ruled these lands for an Age, drawing together the warring magics of the mythic races into one all-powerful and cohesive force. That was, of course, before The Ending.&#10;&#10;The Ruined City is now home to but a fragment of the mythic races that once served the Archmage and her Order. And until now, no human has dared step foot in these forsaken streets. The newcomers, of human stock, are the descendants of the ancient Mages, now outcasts living in camps in the farthest reaches of the lands. Unusual shows of power in their home villages have already gathered them small but enthusiastic bands of followers. And now they have travelled to meet with representatives of the mythic races, to seek their wisdom and magical secrets.&#10;&#10;The mythic races are the keepers of six very different spheres of magic, with very different abilities. It was only the power of the Archmage that long ago found ways to combine the spheres and gain higher and higher levels of magic. Now, much of the magic of the mythic races is lost, and the newcomers, having come so far, are told they must now travel the lands to reclaim lost relics sacred to the races. It seems the journey to absolute magical power has only just begun...&#10;&#10;Archmage is a euro-thematic hybrid, where players take on the role of fledgling Mages, traveling the lands to recover ancient relics, gather followers, and train apprentices in six spheres of magic and beyond. As the power of their Order grows, they will pit apprentices against each other, and attain unheard of spells and magical powers, building their own Mage tower to watch over the lands and weave their magics.&#10;&#10;When the time of reckoning comes, a new Archmage will rule.&#10;&#10;Each turn is formed of two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Journey: A Mage travels across the map (formed of hex tiles): discovering new locations; deploying followers to gather relics from Ruins, Libraries, Sacred Glades, and other locations sacred to each of the mythic races; and encountering and dealing with the followers of their opponents. &#10;     Journey's End: A Mage will finish each Journey in a specific location where they can perform a specific action. &#10;         Ending a Journey on a Town will let the Mage call on their Followers to deliver the relics and resources they have gathered.&#10;         Ending in a Settlement (where the spurned descendants of the Mages fled after the Ending) will let a Mage recruit more Followers to their Order.&#10;         Ending with a Mythic Race will let the Mage train Followers as Apprentices specialising in the magic of that Mythic Race (at a cost of the Relics with which the magic must be weaved).&#10;         Ending in the Wilderness will let the Mage's followers take more physical control over the area. &#10;         Ending in the Mage's Tower (once it has been built), will let the Mage train and test their Apprentices. On the floor of the tower (player board) is a mandala in which the Apprentices stand. Moving apprentices on the mandala will change the sorts of spells the Order has access to. Testing apprentices sees one apprentice advance to a higher level and allows an Order to discover new spells and magics beyond what any of the Mythic Races could individually know, and to add to those magics to their spell library. &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Spells provide Mages with a range of options for strategic and tactical play. Archmage has a modular spell system, with 18 spells included in the base game, and expansions planned to add more sets. Spells are used by expending a cost in Relics, the magical currency of the game that is unique to each mythic race.&#10;&#10;The game is played over a number of turns, depending on the player count. After the last turn, the Mage with the most powerful Order of Mages, is declared the new Archmage and power is restored to the lands... until the next time!&#10;&#10;"

At the end of the agreed number of rounds, the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, participants can either declare the leading players co-winners or have the point leaders enter an elimination round where they take turns being dealer until one player earns a point and others do not.&#10;&#10;There are two roles that change throughout the game: the dealer and players. Each participant begins the game with over/under and yes/no cards they use to make their predictions about the dealer.&#10;&#10;Play begins when the first dealer selects a card from the stack, reads the prediction to be made, then reveals the card to all players. Each player signifies how they think the dealer will respond by placing their prediction card face-down in front of them. Once all players have locked in their predictions, the dealer reveals their answer, and players flip their prediction cards face-up. The number of correct predictions by the players will determine how many correct predictions the dealer will need to take the card and earn a point.&#10;&#10;Using the same prediction selected by the dealer, players place their answer card face-down in front of them to lock in their answers about themselves. The dealer then makes the same prediction about each player. If the dealer makes at least as many correct predictions about the players as the players made about them, the dealer places the active card in front of them, signifying they've earned one point. A tie favors the dealer, as long as they've made at least one correct prediction. Play continues by the next clockwise player becoming the dealer and drawing a new card from the stack. Whether you're looking to meet a stranger or learn very personal things about your friends, I Mustache U is an exciting experience that is sure to create memorable moments and connect people through play.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;"

Since you can't draw additional cards in the game, if you check your remaining hand it is obvious which role you played.&#10;&#10;You must act as either a Murderer trying not to get caught, or as a Detective to accuse the culprit.

The lid lifted off to form the playing field, with individual yard markings and eight lines running the length of the field lettered A-G. A wooden bar on a slider is used to mark the position of the ball, and there is a metal 10-yard marker that slides up one side of the lid.&#10;&#10;The base has a large mechanism in the center, with a brass spinner embedded in a wooden wheel with 19 spaces numbered in a random order. The wheel in turn has a knob that is used to rotate the wheel against numerically ordered numbers on the surrounding board. There are six small windows on each side of the wheel, with the offense to the left and the defense to the right.&#10;&#10;The offensive player has three play options (line buck, forward pass or end run) as well as three kicking plays (kick-off, goal kick and punt). The defensive player has a matching set of windows.&#10;&#10;The offensive player calls a play, spins the spinner, and then rotates the wheel so that the spun number on the wheel aligns with the same number on the outer circle. He then reads the initial results of the play from the appropriate offensive window. The defensive player then spins, using the wheel to produce additional results in the matching window. For instance, an offensive pass play might read &quot;25 yds A&quot;, a gain of 25 caught at the sideline. The defensive window would then indicate whether the pass was complete, incomplete, intercepted or triggered an offensive or defensive penalty.&#10;&#10;The game proceeds and scores using normal football rules. The intricate double spinner and interlocking wheel mechanism is unusual, as is the solid wood construction. But except for the limited offensive play calling options, the results are essentially random.&#10;&#10;"

Once removed the colors will be more vibrant and it will be easier to see cards in a stack inside a sleeve.&#10;&#10;The players attempt to win rounds by getting rid of their cards as quickly as possible using the classic climbing trick mechanic.  e.g. If a player leads with three 4s then the next player must play three of a kind of equal or higher value.  When all players pass, the last player to have played cards leads a new trick with whatever card or set of equal cards they want. Go out of cards first for first place, second for second, etc.&#10;&#10;However, you also have advancements you can sleeve onto your cards. These may increase or decrease the value of the cards, or even add new abilities such as turning a card into a wild or reversing the direction of the values (i.e. you are now playing lower numbers instead of higher) or making cards count as multiple copies of themselves, etc.&#10;&#10;But since all of the cards are reshuffled and dealt to start a new round, the changes you made may end up with someone else (and vice versa), and the common distribution of values will begin to change and shift over multiple hands. Thus, a good strategy must factor in not just doing well in the current hand, but also managing your resources (card advancements) over multiple hands and maximizing their impact though well timed plays.&#10;&#10;You earn points and more advancements based on your end of round position. Be the first player to go out each round and gain the most points, but draw fewer new advancements for the next hand. To win a player must first get to 10 points, and then win a hand.&#10;&#10;Inspired by the public domain game Daihinmin&#10;&#10;"

The score for the word is based on the product of the number of letters in the word played and the value on a multiplier chance card selected during the player turn.  The multiplier cards have values of 0 to 10, -5 and -10.  Hence playing a large word may be a good thing, or a bad thing.&#10;&#10;The game board has 676 spaces for word forming (26x26 spaces).&#10;&#10;There are also other types of chance cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Bonus word cards that allows the player to play a second word during their turn.&#10;     A swap tiles card which causes the players to switch their game tiles with that of the player to their left.&#10;     A bankrupt card which sets the total score of the player to zero.  If chosen early in the game, the player can recover.  This card is only put in the card deck if there are three or more players.&#10;&#10;&#10;We think that the ability to make larger words and the addition of chance makes WordChance lots fun to play.&#10;&#10;"

The board and pieces are made of ceramic.&#10;&#10;The Lion is the King and the Elephants and Giraffes are the Pawns. The winner is the first to capture the opponent's Lion, or to move their own Lion onto the opponent&rsquo;s Lion's base area.&#10;&#10;Pieces have dual natures; one is their shape and the other is their species.&#10;&#10;Players move their own pieces and try to sandwich any of the opponent's piece or pieces. If the player's pieces making the sandwich are of the same species, this is a capture and the captured animals are removed from the board. A Lion can sandwich and capture any opponent&rsquo;s pieces, using their own Elephant or Giraffe piece as the other end of the sandwich.&#10;&#10;But the dual nature of the pieces gives the game more complexity.&#10;&#10;For example, a player's own Elephant piece will sandwich and capture the opponent's Giraffes and Lion by using the opponent's Elephant. The same specie will work together! Likewise, the opposing Giraffes will work together to capture the opponent's Elephants and Lion. Only the two Lions will not work together.&#10;&#10;This dual system is a unique and very interesting system first invented by the designer Mitsuo Yamamoto in 2008, and the game was first produced in 2011, a small and a large edition.

Your mortal enemy is just out of range, seething with lethal intent. Only one of you will walk away; only one will be victorious. Choose your weapons, test your mettle, and cross steel with your foe in a duel to the death.&#10;&#10;Clash of Steel is a tactical two-player card game of medieval duels. Every element of play is designed to explore the nuanced and complex decision-making of crossing blades, from choosing your stance to selecting your target.&#10;&#10;Gameplay focuses on managing your limited stamina, predicting your opponent's actions, and whittling their defenses down until you can land a final, crushing blow.&#10;&#10;The game takes about five minutes to learn and 10-15 minutes to play.

Before recorded history, songs tell of a chieftain named Odif who led Clan Black to many victories and in time chiseled out the land of Blackwallen. He declared himself king and established laws for a royal bloodline. Descendents of Odif occupied the throne through centuries of in-fighting, war, and famine. To many, Blackwallen&rsquo;s constant instability meant it was cursed. To others, it was just home.&#10;&#10;One hundred years ago a new age dawned. Adjacent kingdoms were uninterested in conquering the land, and peace at home meant security in Blackwallen for perhaps the first time. With security came cultural and scientific pursuits and the king himself declared an &ldquo;Age of Peace&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;King Leopold is the third king of the Age of Peace. He has levied trade agreements with neighbors into alliances. He is a young king, but already the people talk of his wisdom.&#10;&#10;When he dies, a very real void will be left. His queen will no longer have a doting husband. His children will be without a loving father. The Orbly Street Tavern will no doubt miss its masked late night musician known only as &ldquo;The Night Singer&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The Kingdom of Blackwallen will no longer have their beloved monarch.&#10;&#10;Blood Royals is a game about two relatives trying to claim the throne from a dying king. Secretly choose your action, reveal and then use your skills (and a bit of luck) to conquer lands and gain the favor of influential people with powerful abilities.&#10;&#10;This is a roll and write game.

The wrestlers must have good Chanko-Nabe from the kitchens (Chanko casseroles, a typical food for Sumo wrestlers). You must recruit new Rikishi (wrestlers), and they visit the Ozashiki (parlours) to gain support from Geisha and Oiran. Ultimately the wrestlers will gain victory at the Dohyo (Sumo ring) by pushing off the opponent, sometimes with support from Ninja actions.&#10;&#10;This is a 2 player game of comparing numbers in three areas, the Dohyo, the Kitchen, and the Ozashiki. Each section gives you a different victory bonus which you can use further on. Play RIKISHI cards face-down from your hand against these sections, apply any extra actions (such as revealing cards or moving cards) and then compare strengths. The winner of the section advances their chip and this helps them further.&#10;&#10;Winning in the Dohyo is crucial to victory, but without Kitchen and Ozashiki support, you would eventually fail there.

Someone reads the hexadecimal RGB color-code (the kind that is used in web pages), and players aim to be the first to grab the corresponding color card.&#10;&#10;In Japan, there is a a 400-year-old card game for two players, named Hyakunin Isshu      (100 Poems by 100 Poets) (Wikipedia: Karuta), for example &quot;Iroha Karuta&quot;, or Ogoola Karuta: 50 English Classics. Two players kneel on the floor opposite each other, with cards arranged in front of them. On each card are small pieces of text from classic poetry, and typically with a small illustration.&#10;&#10;A separate Reader chooses from a random deck and sings a phrase out loudly. The players must search to find the matching couplet on their cards and either grab or block the appropriate card. Whoever snatches the most cards wins. Play is very swift and physically as well as mentally demanding.&#10;&#10;This game, Color Code, is basically the same. The difference is that there are no illustrations on the played cards, but instead a single color is printed on them. The Reader doesn't read a phrase, but calls out an HTML color-code, like #FFFFFF or #FF0000. When the Reader calls a code, the players must know which color it is and make their play. So if the Reader calls &quot;#FF0000&quot;, players must grab the red card.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;WEB&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#233;&#128;&#178;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;RGB&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#170;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#146;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#169;&#178;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#232;&#137;&#178;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#128;&#159;&#229;&#186;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#182;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#162;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"
