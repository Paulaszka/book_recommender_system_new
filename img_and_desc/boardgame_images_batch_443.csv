Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.&#10;&#10;Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.&#10;&#10;Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2015, the &quot;beta&quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for all factions are also available for download, called &quot;starter lists&quot;. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdoms of Men (medieval humans), Basileans (clerical army with saints and angels), Forces of Nature (Treemen, Dryads and other assorted forest creatures), Forces of the Abyss (devils and demons), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes. &#10;Additional factions lists are now available in the &quot;Uncharted Empires&quot; supplement: The Brotherhood (high medieval and mystical humans with elementals), Salamander (humanoid lizards), The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans and halflings), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/ fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undead... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).&#10;&#10;"

It is recommended for groups of not less than seven nor more than fifteen players.&#10;&#10;There are no rules in COMMUNITY - only procedures by which to play. Dice Roll and Role Cards create a simulation of day-to-day living conditions and the responsibilities which we all must face.

Decisions about what a player can or cannot do are made by the Gamemaster based on his learning goals for the group.

It means they can move diagonally forwards and backwards over any number of empty fields. Similarly, they can capture at any distance, if the field directly behind the opposing piece is empty. A king must move to that empty field directly behind the captured piece. Removal of the captured piece is immediate and occurs during the capture, as in Turkish Checkers.&#10;&#10;Capture is enforced. Multiple captures are possible. Maximum capture is not enforced. A player can choose any capturing line he wishes as long as he does not end it while the capturing piece can still do captures. Since removal of captured pieces is immediate and capture is enforced, it can happen that a king immediately reverses direction in a capture.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to block or capture all pieces of the opponent, leaving him without a legal move.&#10;&#10;"

Black Sam took the map with him to his watery grave &ndash; but perhaps the surviving navigator can help to find the treasure by locating the exact position of the islands. Is Antigua one of them?&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Players start with a ship and its crew. Each player during his/er turn uses the actions provided by the crewmen of the ship. Each player may have a maximum of 4 crewmen. Each crewman has an action that may change during the game, thanks to the officer mechanism. A player, by using the officer, may&#10;change the crewmen available actions and thus change the gameplay for all players.&#10;The purpose of the game is to discover islands with treasure (with the help of the crew's Navigator), or while traveling, clash with other players and steal their treasure.&#10;&#10;CREW MEN:&#10;&#10;    Kanonier: one kanonier crewman draws a card from the crew deck and adds its attack to the battle with a +1 bonus. Two kanoniers add +2 bonus&#10;    Offizier: changes the crewmen actions and then is discarded from the ship's crew.&#10;    Navigator: reveals a sea card your ship is on. If it is an island, gain a crew card from the deck for its treasure value and then discard the Navigator.&#10;    Steuermann: one Steuermann moves your ship twice. Two move your ship three times.&#10;    Maat: one Maat hires two new crewmen. Two hires three new crewmen. (if you have more than 4 crewmen, you must discard down to four).&#10;&#10;&#10;GAME END:&#10;The game ends when the biggest part of the sea has been discovered (how big is this part varies, according to the number of players), or when a pre-defined number of battles has happened and the winner is the player with the most treasures.&#10;&#10;"

At the start of the game, each partnership has the lowest possible score, which is two. By winning games, a partnership can increase its score to a higher rank: three, four, five and so on. Above ten come jack, queen, king and ace. The objective is to achieve a score higher than ace - the partnership that achieves this wins the game.&#10;&#10;In each hand, one team forms the declarers, sometimes known in Chinese as dang1 zhuang1 (&#229;&#189;&#147;&#229;&#186;&#132;), and the other team forms the opponents. In the first hand, either team can be the declarers, depending on who makes trumps. In subsequent hands, the team that won the previous hand is the declarers, and the other team is the opponents.&#10;&#10;One member of the declarers' team is the starter, who has the advantage of taking the last cards in the deal, discarding some cards, and leading the first trick. While the declarers try to increase their score, the opponents' objective is to take at least 80 card points, in which case they become the declarers for the next deal.&#10;&#10;Source: edited from Pagat, http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html&#10;&#10;"

(With two players, each player sets up two card holders.) Ideally these cards have been mixed and shuffled so that they face in different directions. Once all the holders are set, each player passes a holder left, then a 30-second sand timer is started, during which time each player writes down on their score sheet what images they think they see in the line-art jumble. Players go through this process for each holder, then they reveal the images one by one.
