The competition will be relentless. To win, players must bring their Kingdom to dominate the stock market with a savvy combination of warfare, technology and trade.&#10;&#10;THE STOCK STATES&#10;The Stock States are a rich empire with a bizarre form of government: a stock monarchy. The Supreme Sovereign wields absolute power, but his election and term in office are determined by the satisfaction of the stockholders, the true masters of the Land.&#10;&#10;CORONATION CHALLENGE&#10;The time has come to nominate a new Supreme Sovereign. As usual, the Coronation Challenge is issued so as to find the most talented contestant amongst the richest Houses of the Realm. The winner of the Challenge will be crowned Ruler of the Stock States.&#10;The Challenge will take place on one of the peripheral and uncivilized islands of the empire. The Island is inhabited by Mattoks, somewhat obtuse and na&iuml;ve creatures with a very basic lifestyle. Mattoks can&rsquo;t quite discern between good and evil and are therefore easy to manipulate or to corrupt. They are not to be entrusted with complex tasks, but they are excellent at following simple instructions and will comply with whatever command in exchange for a few shiny coins.&#10;At the beginning of the Challenge every participant will be assigned a starting region of equal dimension and three months&rsquo; time to showcase their strategic skills and &ndash; most important of all &ndash; to enrich the stockholders.&#10;The management of the Realms on the Island mirrors the stock monarchy of the Stock States: each scion will be free to act as an authentic absolute monarch, but his choices will be evaluated by the stock market. Dominating the market, however, will not be easy: all shareholders ultimately desire to grow richer and see the value of their shares rise, but some of them also have specific preferences on how this should be done. The two most prominent examples are definitely the conqueror and pioneer currents. The conquerors want a Ruler in power who pursues profit through military expansion, while the pioneers prefer one who will enrich them by investing in technological growth. Therefore, whoever wants to sit on the Throne of the Stock States will not only have to effectively administer his own Realm, but will also have to distribute copious dividends and support, at least in part, the interests of conquerors and pioneers. Ultimately, the winner of the Coronation Challenge will be the Ruler who is able to impose himself on the market and make the value of the shares of his Realm soar.&#10;&#10;GAME-FLOW&#10;The Game-Flow has 3 stages: Setup, Round and End Game.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&bull; Creating the island: the Island is created, depending on the number of Players (in a 2-Player game it is possible to create more&#10;than 2 billion different Map layouts, in a 4 Player game more than a trillion, and that's without counting Resources and Know-How Tokens).&#10;&bull; Auctioning the Starting Territories: Players bid to seize the best possible starting Territory for their Realms.&#10;&bull; Setting up the Realms: every Ruler autonomously chooses the initial Setup of their Realm.&#10;&#10;ROUND&#10;&bull; 3 Game Rounds: The 3 Game Rounds is where the real action takes place. The Kings have to plan and implement their strategies by issuing orders to the Spies and Mattoks of their own Realm. This is done through the 14 Command Cards, which let Players move their Spies and carry out Actions with the Mattoks.&#10;&#10;END GAME&#10;&bull; Distributing dividends to the shareholders: the Money, Ingots and revenue from the sale of White Whiskey are used to pay&#10;dividends, which drives up the value of the shares of the Realm.&#10;&bull; Announcing the winner: the Player whose shares have reached the highest value is crowned as new Supreme Sovereign of the Stock States.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Enter the world of Eloria, plagued by darkness and monsters of a vitriolic nature. You and your party will explore and make decisions that directly affect the world&rsquo;s infrastructure and future. The vastly branching storylines and numerous NPCs found in West of Souls ensure unique game play and future replay ability.&#10;&#10;Enemy encounters and agonizing choices abound in this game and even the simplest of decisions may alter the world as you know it. Players will take up the mantle of an unlikely hero who, through motives of their own, have decided to stop Eloria&rsquo;s impending doom. Be it gold, valor, or a deep empathy for the world around them, the players must work together to gain victory over scenarios and continue on their journey.&#10;&#10;As players progress through the ever-changing world, they will develop their abilities, gain increasingly effective gear, and unlock additional skills specific to their character. Following each completed scenario, player choices will determine the future direction of the party&rsquo;s quest, guaranteeing player involvement in the development of their own story. &#10; The game is split into scenarios that are comprised of an exploration and journey phase, and each turn is split into a time of day (morning, mid-day, dusk, night). In the journey phase of the game, characters with travel throughout the game map discovering locations, triggering events, battling monsters, interacting with the world, and talking with NPCs to gain information about their quest and Eloria&rsquo;s tainted past. Action point-based turns are used within West of Souls. Each player will have a defined number of actions that may be completed on their turn (unless you have unlocked a skill or found some gear that says otherwise). Once enough information has been gathered and players are in the correct location, the exploration phase begins.&#10;&#10;One unique aspect of West of Souls is that the exploration phase is a hybrid of non-linear narrative, card-based battle encounters, and dungeon crawling. In addition, all characters in play do not have to enter the same exploration together, allowing for multiple explorations to occur simultaneously. Within the exploration phase, players will be forced to make harrowing choices, complete skill checks, and defeat beast to move forward. Vital story elements, lore, and history will be revealed to the players as they progress through the game.  &#10;While death is an option in West of Souls, a player is never permanently removed from the game. The main resources in this epic journey are time and stress. If your team does not accomplish their goal within the allotted time frame, Eloria is cast into ruin. Likewise, if the encounters prove too much for your party and your stress level reaches a breaking point, you will lose the game. Victory is achieved at the end of each scenario as players defeat enemies of increasing difficultly and complete the necessary tasks. &#10; This flagship game from Sky Monster Games is an ambitious story telling odyssey that maximizes the use of battle mechanics in combination with non-linear storytelling and character customization.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

It comes with two expansions, the Emigration and Arsenic Expansion, that are not found in the retail edition. They can be obtained in Tinners' Trail: Expansions Box.&#10;&#10;&#10;In Tinners' Trail, set in 19th century Cornwall, you represent a mining conglomerate at the height of the tin and copper mining industry. You must buy plots of land across Cornwall in auctions and survey them for tin and copper, always managing your &quot;work points&quot; and money effectively.&#10;&#10;Once you have a mine in place, it's time to extract the ore and (ideally) make a profit, but the deeper your mine goes, the more expensive the process gets. To reduce the cost of mining, you can place developments, such as ports, train stations, and adits (drainage tunnels), but there's only so many improvements to go around. Once you have made your money &mdash; trying to time the market to sell when prices are high &mdash; you can invest it in industries outside of Cornwall, which gains you victory points. The earlier you invest, the better the return. Can you outplay the competition and make the most money, or will you be left without two shillings to rub together?&#10;&#10;What's changed since 2008?&#10;Increased player count - a game that was once only 3-4 players can now be enjoyed by 1-5 players!&#10;&#10;2 new expansions - the Arsenic expansion, which introduces a new resource, and the Emigration expansion, which sees miners travel overseas.&#10;&#10;Reduced randomness - but still keeping the variability. The board is now set up with tiles instead of the roll of a the dice.&#10;&#10;Improved Auctions - dual-use cards are now an important part of the game, giving you information before an auction or an extra boost after an auction.&#10;&#10;Improved artwork and graphic design&#10;&#10;Improved component quality - with custom meeples and colour blind friendly colours.&#10;&#10;Lord Wallace solo mode - a brand new solo mode.&#10;&#10;"

Focus on building up your infrastructure and set yourself up for a strong finish or go for fast and immediate rewards. Use your Influence in the council chamber to make sure things progress according to your wishes, or resort to outright aggression to dominate the competition.&#10;&#10;A New Frontier is a highly engaging conflict game where your ability to gauge your opponents is key to victory. Since players can interact with all other players, regardless of position, conflicts are plentiful, but also quite undramatic. There is no player elimination, and you also cannot &ldquo;gang-up&rdquo; on someone, at least not from a conflict perspective. Conflicts are multi-phased, with ample opportunity to outsmart your opponents.&#10;&#10;A New Frontier has nearly no hidden info (the obvious exception being player fleets) and few random elements, and with only 5 turns every decision counts. The goal of the game is to become the most dominant Corporate Republic in the Alpha System, which is achieved by having the most Victory Points by game&rsquo;s end. All types of actions can potentially lead to Victory Points allowing for multi-pronged strategies. In addition to Actions and Credits, players must balance Prestige, which represents their organization&rsquo;s goodwill and reputation, and that is essential for certain aspects of the game.&#10;&#10;The game is centered around four ore-rich planets, with each player being present at every planet. This is where players harvest ore for income, build ships and upgrade mines, as well as carry out attacks against each other. In addition, there are four support areas/phases (Exploration, Politics, Marketing and R &amp; D), where players can choose to diversify in order to gain advantages and Victory Points. Each Turn starts with a Planning Phase where players hiddenly set their strategic plan for the whole turn by using the resources at their disposal. Players then make tactical decisions during each Action Phase within the framework of their strategic plan.&#10;&#10;Depending on chosen strategy, a player will normally amass between 30-60% of their Victory Points during the game, and the rest during end game scoring.&#10;&#10;"
