The regular Yahtzee rules listed below are used (except that there are thirty-nine categories instead of thirteen). The columns on the score sheet are divided into first, second and third with a multiplier added to each. For First column the scores are just added up, for second column the scores are doubled and for third column the scores are tripled so in effect throwing 4 - 6's in column one would be valued at 24 but those same 4 - 6's put in column three would be worth 72 points. Therefore it is important to put your very good scores in the third column.&#10;&#10;Yahtzee rules: A classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.&#10;&#10;"

In the game of CODA players try to crack each other's &quot;code&quot; - a sequence of secret numbers.  Guess an opponent's secret number and it is revealed (by knocking it down).  Guess incorrectly and you must reveal one of your own secret numbers!  On each turn, a new number enters play, which helps you to narrow the possibilities and grow your own code.  Common sense, intuition and your &quot;detective&quot; skills will guide you to success.&#10;&#10;From me:&#10;&#10;There are two sets of tiles (similar to Stratego pieces without the soldiers) numbered 0-11.  One set is black, one is white.  In four player game, everyone one grabs three random pieces and arranges them in numeric order, with white pieces going to the right on ties.  In order a player grabs one of the remaining tiles and guesses on of the opponents pieces.  If correct, that piece is revealed. If the player is incorrect the piece that was just drawn is placed in the correct place in his own sequence and revealed.  If the player was correct in guessing he MAY make another guess.  If he chooses not to then he places the picked piece in his code, in sequence, but does not reveal it.&#10;&#10;Play continues until only one person has a piece standing.

Judson Kilpatrick conceived a bold stroke against the Confederate capital, which local Union sympathizers had correctly reported as wide open to attack. The goals of the raid were to release the thousands of Union prisoners of war held in Libby Prison and on Belle Isle, as well as inflicting damage on key Rebel installations like the Tredegar Iron Works. &#10;Secret orders also authorized the killing of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and burning the city to the ground.&#10;&#10;Historically, at the last minute, Kilpatrick lost his nerve and withdrew without firing a shot. The game begins at that point, but with the assumption the Union commander's nerve holds. As the Union raiders enter the city, it's a race against time as they seek to commandeer transport for the sick, wreak destruction across Richmond as slaves and panicked civilians fill the streets, and escape before Confederate army reinforcements begin pouring in from all directions.&#10;&#10;"

The twist is that the movement token is actually the piece of clay molded into a pineapple.&#10;&#10;Players may land on a color, which gives permission for the opponent of that color to SMASH the player's pineapple with their Punchy. Other squares are &quot;safe&quot; or give further movement instructions.  A smashed pineapple may still advance to the finish line, unless it gets too flat.  Some squares call for a &quot;Size Check&quot; and if the pineapple (of flat remnant of one) exceeds the borders of the square the player must reverse directions to remold their pineapple at the start.  There are also a few squares that allow remolding along the track.&#10;&#10;The average game sees most pineapples getting smashed at least once or twice. The winner is the player arriving at the finish line first.  Gameplay may last as little as 10 minutes (depending on the dexterity of the players with the Play-Doh mold).&#10;&#10;"

8993,,"Fire in the East covers the war in the Soviet Union from the start of the Barbarossa invasion in June 1941 through the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942. It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.&#10;&#10;Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.&#10;There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.&#10;&#10;The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.&#10;&#10;Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps (1B, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A)&#10;    over 2880 die-cut counters (Europa 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42)&#10;    a complete set of rules&#10;    a complete set of charts&#10;    two dice&#10;&#10;&#10;(source: back of the box and user's description)&#10;&#10;"

9005,,"A Dutch game.&#10;Each player controls a mobster gang consisting of one Boss and 20 members. A player can win if all other bosses are eliminated or by occupying one side of the board and playing the appropriate card related to that side.&#10;&#10;Players have the option of either moving or cashing money:&#10;&#10;Pieces can move on foot or up to four can move faster by car. When either one of the gang is on a &quot;Take a card&quot; space, follow that instruction. Cards can be good, or not really, at times. When stopping at a space occupied by rivals, a shootout occurs. A six sided die (two blank sides, two times one and two times two) is rolled until only one gang is present in the square. Players eliminate whatever they roll, a blank being a miss.&#10;&#10;After placing the boss on the board all gang members and cars have to be purchased. Money can be cashed if playing pieces occupy squares in front of nightclubs or restaurants. They can gamble by rolling the die if they occupy one or more casino spaces. Most money is made when a gang succeeds in smuggling a barrel of alcohol from the owned brewery to one of the bars.&#10;Controlling the police comes in handy as well.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a grid with streets and blocks divided in a North, East, South and West side.&#10;The gangs come in six colors.

There lives the polar bear, or &quot;nanuq&quot; as he is known among the Inuit.  It is the strongest and most dangerous creature for far and wide, feared equally by man and animal.  Therefore, only with great care do the Inuit hunters dare to venture onto the ice, jumping from ice floe to ice floe towards their main source of food -- the fish.  Then they must evade the dangerous &quot;nanuq&quot; and return safely home with their catch!  Only the cleverest and most courageous Inuit will succeed in catching sufficient fish...&#10;&#10;Each player has a team of four Inuit, who use ice floes to move to the opposite shore to catch fish, and then return home.  The game ends once a player succeeds in returning four Inuit to the home igloo, with each bringing along one fish.&#10;&#10;This game has some surprising similarities to the American game Polar Dare! that was designed by Dan Glimne and published by Milton Bradley in that same year (1991).&#10;&#10;"

9028,,"The game of seafaring adventure in ancient Polynesia!&#10;&#10;Tongiaki is a tile-laying game that reflects the risks and successes of these early explorers.  There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &quot;tribe&quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.&#10;&#10;This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &quot;water path&quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&#10;300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?&#10;&#10;Description from Uberplay's web site:&#10;&#10;While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.&#10;&#10;"

Failure means paying 20 delegates to each player.&#10;&#10;Whenever a player lands on a Ballot square, hands are scored, and the leading player wins a Bandwagon effect (50 Delegates from each other player). A player that gets ahead therefore tries to trigger other ballots as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;"

The contents include: 28 FULL color Printed Sheets (front &amp; back) of the following 4 designs-Clouds, Vampire, Airplane, Pizza Slice; a DIE; 4 Plane templates; 4 Plastic Planes markers; Rules/Folding Instructions; and a colorful mounted 8 inches by 22 inches mapboard. &#10; Players roll a DIE and move their marker along their track and along the way, they have to make paper planes and compete in various tasks, such as LOOPS, Time Aloft, Target, and Distance. There are 4 separate tracks with the name of one of the paper plane designs and a player has to use the type of plane whose track they are on. Some planes are better at a certain Task but depending on the one landed on, each plane has to attempt to perform it.  Object of the game is to reach Finish first(and retain your sanity is a BONUS!) It can be played inside or outdoors, but NOT recommended during High Winds events or adverse Weather conditions.&#10;&#10;"

9059,,"Another in the &quot;Spinner&quot; category, the game includes: a colorful mounted mapboard; 4 Soft Plastic &quot;Special Monsters&quot;; 48 cardboard &quot;Monster&quot; cards; the &quot;Spinner&quot;; and the Rules. &#10;The mapboard depicts 4 &quot;Arenas&quot; of combat-Ice Caves, Volcano Pit, the SWAMP, New York City, &amp; the center starting place. There are special spots on the board such as Force Field, Transporter, and each &quot;Arena&quot; has one spot directing the player to ANOTHER &quot;Arena&quot;. The players lay out the &quot;Monster&quot; cards randomly onto the game's spaces. Then they move around and &quot;Battle&quot; the Monsters they land on and if successful, claim that Monster's Card. Each card has strengths and weaknesses depending on where that card is located in one of the &quot;Arenas&quot;. The player with the MOST cards, once the last one is battled for, is the winner. The Spinner could also make a player GAIN or LOSE a card to another player.&#10;There are many more NEON color Monsters that were sold in separate sets and collecting them all should be even MORE fun for the lil ones. I first started getting the sets for my Nephews and THEN discovered this game for THEM! There are some truly bizarre figures such as the JOTUN Troll, which has 10 or more heads, the VISIBLE invisible man (EVERYONE should have THAT one!), HANIVER-looks just like a GIANT Gremlins disembodied Head, Spring Heeled Jack (maybe DISCO version?), MANTICORE-Man's Head w/multiFANGS-Lion's forepaws-Eagle haunch-Scorpion/Pincer tail, Baby YAGA (what? no TEEN angst ridden type?), TRITON-MerMAN, COCKATRICE-Griffin like with Snake body, BIGFOOT! the BEAST...&amp; Great BEAST, lots of your well known garden variety MONSTERs &amp;...RED CAP(?)-I bet HE turns out to be bright...NEON...GREEN! LOTS of FUN for EVERYONE! WHOA!...I believe THIS predates PoKeMoN, them copyright infringement...so &amp; sos!&#10;&#10;"
