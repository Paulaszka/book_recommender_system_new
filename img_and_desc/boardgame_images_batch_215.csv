Each player controls 2-4 different lines (based on the number of players).&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player can build four pieces of track on the map in any of their color. All track pieces must extend the color.

If there are no cards face up in either type, the passenger only moves once. The passenger always uses the shortest route from their current position, avoiding walking and line changes. The passenger scores one point for each line they used to get to their destination.&#10;&#10;When there is not enough destination cards to turn face up from the deck, the passenger marker is removed from the game. Players get equal turns, but after the passenger marker is removed, no more points are awarded from passenger movement and players can only build track.

Many consider this time period to be the birth of modern warfare tactics that continue to be used and perfected by today's modern armies.&#10;&#10;Conflict of Heroes merges the elegance of streamlined Eurogame rules with deep strategic wargames. The series was designed to create a tense and highly interactive game play experience. You must manage multiple command resources to move, attack, and take other actions with your units. This gives you great flexibility in executing your battle plans, but makes constant caution necessary as unit activations on either side can happen at any time.&#10;&#10;Much effort went into distinguishing the units in the game by highlighting their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, each tank defense rating takes into account relative armor thickness, armor slope deflection percentage, speed, size, targeting mechanics, and crew training. All these factors are represented in an easy to learn target number system.&#10;&#10;The included firefights, most of which you can play in about an hour, are designed to depict the pivotal points in a given battle. You can learn enough of the game to play the first scenario in ten minutes thanks to the programmed instruction approach used in the full-color rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game also features three- and four-player firefights and optional rules for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;"

It is thought to have been the first Shogi variant to utilize drops (a mechanic in the modern version of 9&times;9 Shogi and absent from the original 9&times;9 Sho Shogi).  Each piece is named after a type of bird.  The royal piece (King) is the Phoenix.  Other pieces include the Swallow (promotes to Wild Goose), Falcon (promotes to Eagle), Crane, Pheasant, and Quail.  The goal of the game is to capture the opposing Phoenix.&#10;&#10;Somewhat of an oddity is the fact that a player's two Quail pieces are actually asymmetrical, being designated as the Left Quail and the Right Quail, with their movement capabilities mirrored.  Drops are handled in a manner very similar to modern Shogi.  A third swallow cannot be dropped in a file that contains two others, nor can one be dropped on the last rank, where it would not be able to move.  In addition, a swallow cannot be dropped so as to give immediate mate.&#10;&#10;The promotion zone for Swallows and the Falcon consists of the opponent's back two ranks.  Promoted pieces revert to their un-promoted value when they are captured (for purposes of dropping back into play).&#10;&#10;"
