231380,,"Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;Sage Signs is a competitive faux-medieval card game for 2 to 4 players in which the players must make poker-like combinations of mystical Sign cards in a dominoes-like arrangement. Making combinations allows players to place summoning Seals to block opponents, cast crafty spells, and in the end summon a powerful (but benevolent) Spirit.&#10;&#10;In a typical turn, you may use your two actions to either draw or place a numbered Sign card next to another card of the same value, one higher/lower value, or the same suit. Additionally, by discarding a Sign card onto an open spell slot, you may cast the spell of that card's suit, and by placing Seals atop a Sign card marked with a &quot;V,&quot; you may invoke the effects of one of the eight game-changing Virtue cards. When specific poker-like combinations of cards are made, a number of Seals corresponding to the strength of that combination may be put down. When someone has laid down all 7 of their Secondary Seals, they must create a combination of cards that yields more Seals than the the central Spirit card demands. The number of Seals indicated on the Spirit card (1 to 4) indicates the difficulty of the end game.&#10;&#10;"

The lowest score after 6 rounds wins.&#10;&#10;Each player creates their own Laydown Pile of 6-point hands during each round.

The aim of the game is to be the first team to find the kids and bring them back to the Visitor Centre &#10;without first being killed off.&#10;&#10;The board is an 8x8 grid in the form of a map of the island. In one corner is the Visitor Centre (safe start and end zone) from which the players&rsquo; teams start. In the opposite corner is the kids token. The map is populated with terrain in the form of 4 randomly placed lakes, 4 randomly placed mountains and 4 randomly placed valleys.&#10;&#10;Six dinosaurs are placed randomly on the board (but not adjacent to the visitors centre). These dinosaurs are selected at random from a table of 6 dinosaur types. Each dinosaur type is immune from one of the tactics that might be employed by the players (e.g. you cannot outrun the Velociraptors).&#10;&#10;Each player starts with an 8 member team.  Players roll 8 times on a Team Table to get the composition of their team. The 6 different types of team member have skills that improve the tactical abilities of the team. Results and changes are recorded with paper and pencil. During the game, players will lose and gain team members.&#10;&#10;Players share a Common Deck. The deck has 7 types of cards representing the tactics that can be employed to evade the dinosaurs: Hide, Run, Block, Trap, Shoot, Distract, and Special.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 phases.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Equip Phase &#10;         Draw 1 Card from the deck and add it to your hand. Max hand size is 5 cards. &#10;    &#10;     Special Phase&#10;         Special cards not meant to be used in other phases may be played (discarded) for their effects in this phase. &#10;    &#10;     Dinosaur Phase&#10;         Pick 1 Dinosaur by random and roll once on the random movement table to determine how it moves. Dinosaurs move orthogonally but not diagonally and must obey a set of movement rules related to terrain and the location of other dinosaurs.&#10;         If a dinosaur enters the same space as a team, the team will be attacked. The team must attempt to escape. An escape attempt must use 1 tactic from the 6 available (Shoot, Run, Hide, Trap, Block, and Distract. Next, the player must make an escape roll using 2 six-sided dice. Add up the total of the 2 dice rolls and add to this the number of teammates with the matching tactic. Next, play (discard) up to 2 tactics cards and add their bonuses. At least 1 of the tactics cards played must match the chosen tactic. If the Total (roll + team bonuses + card bonuses) is equal to or greater than 12, then the team escapes with no casualties. If the total is less, the team loses a number of random team members equal to the difference. If a team loses all its members, that player is out of the game. &#10;         After the attack, the team must retreat 1 space away.  If you are attacked and you control the kids token you may lose control of the token.&#10;    &#10;     Move Phase&#10;         Move your team pawn 1 space orthogonally. You may play (discard) 1 special card to move the team farther per the cards instructions.

You and your pretend date get asked seriously awkward questions and the other couples get to guess the outcome. Perfect for students, dinner parties and trips down the pub. The game is only loosely based on the TV show, so you can still enjoy the game without knowing too much about it.&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Players split into couples &ndash; they are on a fictional date in a restaurant. Turn by turn, each couple gets asked different questions from the &lsquo;Starters&rsquo; deck.&#10;&#10;Example: &ldquo;Who has the better fashion sense?&rdquo; The couples must decide on their answers without conferring. If they agree with each other and both write down the same name, they win 2 points. If they disagree and write different names, they win 0 points.&#10;Meanwhile, the other couples get to bet on whether the active team will agree or disagree. If they predict correctly, they gain 1 point. If incorrect, they get 0.&#10;&#10;Once every couples has answered a &lsquo;Starter&rsquo; card, they move onto the even more awkward questions in the &lsquo;Main Course&rsquo; deck, before finishing on the painfully-awkward questions in the &lsquo;Dessert&rsquo; deck.&#10;&#10;The winning couple is the one with the most points at the end of dinner.&#10;&#10;"

Each puppy will have a certain number of (fixed and random) maladies and a VP rating.&#10;&#10;Players have a hand of cards which are used to cure the puppies' ailments. At the start of a player's turn s/he draws a card and may cure a puppy if willing and able to do so, taking the card and its VPs. A card may need to be discarded into a face-up discard pile, from which the next player may draw.&#10;&#10;A few special cards offer unique choices to the lucky player who draws one.
