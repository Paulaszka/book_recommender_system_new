The Jena-Auerst&auml;dt game has both battlefields on one map and allows both sides to re-deploy before battle.

Score points by lining up the colors. Sounds simple enough, right? Scoring is done 1 for 1, this means one red dot lined up with 2 red dots scores 3 points for the player who layed the piece. There is a twist however; you must subtract the total # of mismatched dots from your score. The more colors you can line up, the more points you earn and the less points you subtract. Its a battle of scoring more positive points than negative points while competing against an opponent who's being extra careful not to set you up for any high scoring opportunities.&#10;&#10;"

It attempts to make use of several distinguishing mechanics.&#10;&#10;First, no DM player is required. All monsters obey simple AI/automatic rules, which can be performed by anybody willing to do it. Second, dungeon crawl games often take a very long time to play due to a lot of dice rolling. TowerRun attempts to minimize this by eliminating dice rolling wherever possible, including during combat. The (hopeful) end result is not only a faster game, but a more strategic method of play. Third, there is a built in &ldquo;score&rdquo; system that single or multiple players can attempt to beat whenever they play. The game is not designed to be &ldquo;beaten&rdquo; on the first attempt, so multiple attempts are necessary, and each time you can try and beat your previous high score. Finally, a core mechanic of the game revolves around random pairings of objects and enchantments. Quite often objects have unknown enchantments that can be revealed in a calculated or risky method. Players do not know what the enchantments are until they use the item, but if they use the item without first identifying it they run the risk of it being cursed.&#10;&#10;These mechanics make for heightened tension, faster game play, and a depth of balance and strategy.&#10;&#10;"

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.&#10;&#10;The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.&#10;&#10;During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.&#10;&#10;If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.&#10;&#10;"

Players compete as individuals or are grouped into two clans, and they try to land their stones the closest to a target each round. On a player's turn he takes two actions:&#10;&#10;&bull; He launches a stone across the ice, flicking it with his finger toward the target on the other end of the game board.&#10;&#10;&bull; To improve the positioning of his stone or the chances of it staying in place, he can choose to use either a small or large hammer or a totem. With a hammer, the player moves the stone according to the size of the hammer. As for the totem, the player sets it on top of the stone; if the totem falls off the stone, the player can shoot it again on a later turn.&#10;&#10;If your player or clan has one or more stones closer to the center of the target than the other clan, you score points.
