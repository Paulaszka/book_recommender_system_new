Each card has a large letter in the middle, representing its note. The key to which that note belongs is in the upper right corner, and the musical symbol for that key (sharps or flats) is in the upper left. The bottom of the card lists all three notes in that key.&#10;&#10;The rules say that the game can be played as a simple set collection game like Authors, but is more interesting with a second set of rules, which it says resemble &quot;Cassino&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player is dealt a hand of five cards, and five more are dealt face up on the table. In turn, each player must if possible place a card from hand onto the table that matches the key of one of those showing. If unable to place a matching card, he may place any other card on the table. The player who puts the final card in a triad or chord collects all three as a set.&#10;&#10;If no cards remain on the table, the next player puts down any card to start the process over. When any player runs out of cards, one more card is dealt to each player. Once all cards have been played, the player collecting the largest number of sets wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Note, however, that jelly donuts give no dollar tile if paired with a non-jelly donut because who in the world would reward something like that?&#10;&#10;To end your turn, you can place a dollar tile on your shop board to complete a donut (and score) or fill a space with donut holes (which might also score).

Shooting is simultaneous but torpedoes and ram attacks have their own placing in the sequence.&#10;&#10;There are rules for weather and stability, with a die roll at the start of the game to determine the conditions of play.&#10;&#10;Movement is measured in inches, with variable maneuverability depending upon the speed and size of ships involved.&#10;&#10;Shooting is determined after movement has taken place. All shooting depends upon arcs of fire although, once again, there are no templates provided. If a target is in range and inside a firing arc at the end of the movement phase, it can be fired upon.&#10;&#10;To hit a target, a D10 is rolled for each gun requiring a base 'to hit' score depending upon range. There are, in a addition, a small number of +1 modifiers for sea state, angle of fire etc.&#10;&#10;If a hit is scored, a percentile roll is made to detemine damage, with various hit locations and effects. Armour penetration is dealt with by averaging out the actual armour protection of a target across the whole ship, with each vessel classified as either light, medium, heavy or super heavy. Armour penetration depends upon a D10 roll based on the weapon fired and the strength of the armour, modified by range.&#10;&#10;There are additional straightforward rules for spar, locomotive and towed torpeodoes, mines, ramming and boarding. These are dealt with after the movement and shooting phases have been resolved.&#10;&#10;At the end of the rulebook there are 13 comprehensive page of data tables for virtually every fleet that you might wish to deploy, with stats for both minor nations and the major powers. There are also details of the formulae used to calculate the stats for each ship, so you can always fill in the blanks for those vessels that aren't listed.&#10;&#10;"

To set up, players select the character cards of guests who will be present during that game, then take the corresponding character tokens and toss them into the mixing bag. Next, players randomly draw those tokens to fill up the guest list board. After randomly choosing who goes first, the first player gets a gold coin, while the other player gets two. Now the game begins!&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they pick a character token from the guest list board, paying the cost indicated on the board, then they place that guest in the inn, sliding the token into the vertical game board with the colored side facing themselves (while the monochrome-colored side faces their opponent).&#10;&#10;After the token slides into the slot, the player may score points based on the room the guest ended up in, as well as any other guests that might be around. Each character has different abilities that say how they give gold to their corresponding innkeeper. For example, the Little Pigs like to be close to one another; they automatically give the player who placed them 1 gold coin and an extra gold coin for each other Little Pig token connected to them. The Big Bad Wolf, on the other hand, gives their player three gold coins for each row where their innkeeper played more Big Bad Wolf tokens than their opponent at the end of the game. (In case of a tie, neither player gets gold.) There's an art to placing guests as several rooms of the Inn are enchanted and will give a bonus or penalty to the player that places a guest there.&#10;&#10;The game continues with players picking and placing guests until three columns in the inn have been completely filled. When that happens, players gain gold from characters with end of game abilities, then the player who has gained the most gold wins.&#10;&#10;"

It&rsquo;s a bloodless fight where the goal is to bring together as many pawns as possible.&#10;&#10;Each player controls a set of pawns, Black or White. The pawns can appear in two states: fixed or mobile.  At the beginning, the entire 12x12 board is covered in mobile pawns, which alternate in color to create a checker pattern. White starts the game, then players move alternately. During  a move, a player swaps one of his mobile pawns with an adjacent mobile pawn of his opponent. The player&rsquo;s pawn then becomes fixed, but the opponent&rsquo;s pawn does not. Symmetric play can be quite a nuisance, so there&rsquo;s a special rule to discourage it. If a board is in a symmetric position, the next player to move can change the state (mobile/fixed) of any pawn regardless of color instead of doing a standard swap. This does not apply to the first move.&#10;&#10;The game ends when there are no more legal moves. The player who controls the biggest group (defined by orthogonal connectivity of like-colored pawns) is the winner. If the two biggest groups are equal in size, the second-biggest groups are compared, and so on.&#10;&#10;Slyde is the first specimen of a new family of games. In fact, a few designers have already proposed their own interpretations of the same concepts of swapping, fixing and coalescing &ndash; much like there are many variants of Draughts or Chess.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The three games are:&#10;1.  ECOTRIVIA:   Containing 648 Questions related to the environmental issue and the ECOCARDS game.&#10;2.  ECOCARDS: 2 Decks of Cards, using the 4 elements of nature: Earth, Air, Water and Fire, containing 54 EcoTips and 54 EcoVips.&#10;3.
