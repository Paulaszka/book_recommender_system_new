All questions concern Danmark only. Collect a token from each category to win. The players roll a die to move and then they must answer a question from the category they land on. If they answer correctly they get a token and when they've gathered tokens in every colour, they can head to the capital (center). First they need to get to a corner of the board where they answer a question of their own choosing. Then there are two coloured spaces from the corner to the center. When the players get to the center they answer a question of the other player(s) choosing. A correct answer in the center means victory!&#10;&#10;"

It has even been said that there are only two certainties in life...death and taxes.  Today, of course, there is a third certainty...INFLATION!!&#10;&#10;LIFE IS RUFF is about the cycle of income vs. outgo.  As in reality, the proper investments can help you beat inflation and ride the waves of a fluctuating economy.  In somewhat simplified terms, LIFE IS RUFF offers the player the same investment opportunities he has in real life and gives each player the opportunity to make investment decisions.  But any opportunity not taken may be lost, for inflation hits when you least expect it.&#10;&#10;There are those who will gamble, who will feel lucky, who will try to beat the odds and make a killing.  For those we have included the stock exchange and futures market.  There is a fortune to be made there, or lost.  A player may choose to speculate in real estate, buy a home to get a tax break or keep his assets liquid by renting.  All of these choices, and more, are yours and after all LIFE IS RUFF is only a game...or is it?&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;&#10;Each player attempts to obtain a survival package of items that have intrinsic value and are counter-cyclical to inflation.  (Their value rises with inflation instead of declining.)  Players, of course, must have cash to purchase these items (gold, silver, food storage, collectibles, diamonds, property) and the purchasing power of the dollar declines as the game progresses causing prices to &quot;rise.&quot;  The player who has the greatest number of survival assets (points) when RUNAWAY INFLATION strikes (making paper money worthless) is the best prepared and is the WINNER.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

It began as a research project in 1967 by Dr. Julian Compton (1940-2010), a Florida A&amp;M humanities professor and boxing authority. The heavyweights were evaluated on up to 155 variables. The table game was first produced by Gamecraft in 1976. The computerized version was first released in 2004 which is set up similarly to the board game. The computer implementation was done by NASA programmer Don Mankowski.&#10;&#10;Data Boxing features yesterdays legends and hall of famers reflecting the glory days of years gone by. You'll find Ali, Marciano, Dempsey, Louis, Tunney, Foreman, Frazier, Baer, Braddock and more.

Usually these names will be familiar, but ever so often an unknown will rear his head in a bid for greatness.&quot;&#10;&#10;Data Boxing is &quot;the boxer's Boxing Game&quot;. It's a detailed, realistic simulation of boxing where boxers of all eras are matched.  There is a real component to it because it's based on the actual performance of boxers. Individual fighters are rated on cards, and bouts are resolved through dice and charts and/or rounds cards (see Data Boxing II below). To quote Dr. Compton, &quot;The game was popular with boxing writers, due to its obvious awareness of information below the headlines of boxing history, and its mathematical structure, which allowed for the matchup of boxing greats from different time periods.&quot;&#10;&#10;Data Boxing allows you to choose the level of complexity with which you are most comfortable. To quote from the 1980 edition of Data Boxing produced by Big League Game Company, &quot;Data Boxing is one of the most detailed and accurate sports games you can play. It is hoped you can find the level which will give you all the enjoyment that others have had, whether you are 6 or 96. It is a game you can play for a lifetime.&quot;&#10;&#10;Data Boxing was featured in the December 1977 edition of Ring Magazine, the May 1977 and December 1977 editions of Boxing Illustrated, The People's Almanac [1978], Computer Sports Matchups [1981], the December 13th, 2006 issue of the Tallahassee Democrat and the BoxRec Wiki Encyclopedia.

Before the game begins, the players use plastic molds to cookie-cut &quot;Grubs&quot; out of the dough and place them into a mutual pile. The racetrack consist of two side-by-side plastic tracks with a finish line at one end and two plastic plungers (shaped like tree stumps) at the other (one for each player's track).&#10;&#10;On your turn, you roll the die to either race or chomp a worm. If you roll a 1-4, you place the number of grubs indicated into your tree stump and press down the plunger. The dough is mashed and forced out the base in a continuous worm shape over the track. You attach a wheeled worm head to the tip of the dough and add side wheels as needed to support your worm's body. Thus the worms get longer and longer as the race progresses. If you roll a Mr. Chomp, you take a bird shaped device, chomp off the head of your opponent's worm, then place the chomped segment into your tree stump to move your worm ahead. Your opponent must then reattach the plastic worm head to the remainder of his or her worm segment.&#10;&#10;The first player whose worm grows the entire length of the track, crosses the finish line, and takes the checkered flag is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
