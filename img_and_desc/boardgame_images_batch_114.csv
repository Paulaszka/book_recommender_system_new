Includes rules for Berserk Vikings and uses &quot;untried units&quot; in the Viking setup so that neither player knows their combat value until they fight. This represents the fact that Harold's forced march across England so surprised the Vikings that many of them had left their armor behind at their base. The title refers to Eystein Orri leading Viking reinforcements into the battle. One 11.5x16.5 inch game map, 140 counters that have to be mounted and cut-out.&#10;&#10;"
12979,,"In 1066 Saxon King Harold force-marched his army up to York and fought a battle at Stamford Bridge that ended the Viking era in England. He then turned around and force-marched back to the south of England to fight the Normans at Hastings. Unfortunately, after trudging 250 miles in nine days, his soldiers spent the night before the battle singing and drinking instead of resting. Senlac Hill is Norman Smith's nicely done desktop published simulation of the 1066 Battle of Hastings. Emphasis is on disordering the enemy. Good rules covering archers and feigned cavalry attacks. Scenarios include the historical set up with the Saxons waiting on Senlac Ridge and the Normans formed up in the valley below, an alternative scenario that allows the Normans more freedom in deploying their army and one that gives Harold the option of moving down onto the valley floor to force the Normans to fight across boggy ground. One 11.5x16.5 inch game map, 140 counters that have to be mounted and cut-out.&#10;&#10;"

Greatly outnumbered, the Greeks delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Led by the Spartan King, Leonidas, a small force of 300 Spartans and 11,000 other allied Greeks blocked the only road through which the mighty army of the Persian King, Xerxes, could pass on its ongoing invasion of Greece. The massive Persian army, numbering well over 150,000 men succeeded in defeating the Greeks but sustained heavy losses, disproportionate to those of the Greeks. A local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks, revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers to delay the advance of the Persian army as long as it could.&#10;&#10;In the Battle of Thermopylae 2nd Edition board game is a 2 player board game where the two players must bid to see which player will control the smaller Greek forces.

13004,,"The year is AD 79. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?&#10;&#10;The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.&#10;&#10;The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.&#10;&#10;After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.&#10;&#10;"

13006,,"This game is based on the Arduin Role-Playing system by David A. Hargrave. It's described as a game like Poker with unusual twists.&#10;&#10;There are the same numerical cards, 2-10, Jack (Knight), Queen, King and Ace. And like in some Poker varients the Ace may be played as high or low. Whereas a standard Poker deck has four suites, Swords &amp; Dragons has eight. And there is a similarity in which one hand will defeat another.&#10;&#10;The game play appears to be a mix of Hold 'Em, Stud Poker and Go Fish. Cards can be asked for and received by another player if one hasn't hidden them in their Trove. The Trove allows a player to hold up to four cards without worry of them being asked for in Go Fish style. Essentially players can use the cards in their hand and the one &quot;Up&quot; card, that being the last card discarded, as their current hand. The &quot;Up&quot; card may also be taken by a player on their turn and the discard becomes the new &quot;Up&quot; card.&#10;&#10;A round ends when all but one player folds - due to not calling a raise, or the deck runs out of cards.. or, all players call the raise. Then a showdown occurs and it's winner take all.&#10;&#10;The components are a bit flimsy.

13047,,"Invicta was a plastics company, which scored a massive success with the puzzle game Mastermind. This game, released as Box-It and as Territorie, used the same multi-coloured pegs from Mastermind to make the captured cells, as the basic version of the paper &amp; Pencil game of Dot &amp; Boxes. However in Dots and Boxes, the fence once played remained stationary. In The Invicta's releases it was permissible to either play a new fence onto the grid, or swing the fence along it's posts, thereby changing which boxes sides would be filled in.&#10;&#10;The plastic board has large holes for the plastic pegs and little holes for plastic pennants. Place or turn pennants to secure areas, which are marked with different colored pegs for each player.&#10;&#10;The grid of boxes is 8x8 boxes in size.&#10;&#10;"

13059,,"Thomas Salter Ltd appears to have published games and magic sets in the 1950s and 60s. Task Force has a large folding board showing a highly stylised map of Europe and East America, and a small box to hold the pieces and rules. The game does not seem to have a large box to contain both board and bits, and this form of publishing may have been common in the UK post-war.&#10;&#10;The game is a simple battle between blue (US) and red (Russia) pieces in which the players moved different forces from town to town, outnumbering and capturing their opponents. Getting into the opponent's heartland wins the game.&#10;&#10;A random element is provided by a d6 numbered 1-3. A modern element is provided by two atom bombs. These are large red and blue discs which the players may use once in the game. Placing them on the board, they destroy any pieces the touch and remain in place for two turns, blocking movement there.&#10;&#10;I cannot determine a publishing date, but the style of the game and the casual use of of the atom bomb as a strategic piece suggests the game is from the 1950s. It's interesting to see how large Britain is on the map, bigger than France!&#10;&#10;Jean Shepherd (best known for the movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) mentioned an ad for Task Force on his June 18, 1963 radio show.
