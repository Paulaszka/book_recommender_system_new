Players are operating blind and are attempting to find (in the case of the British) or avoid (as for the Germans) each other, as the locations of each player's ships are hidden from each other.  Searches are conducted &agrave; la Battleship by calling out target locations that search planes or ships can 'see'.&#10;If and when the British successfully intercept the Germans, play can then be conducted in a fashion similar to miniatures, with counters laid out on a large space (the floor), and which then maneuver and fire at enemy ships.&#10;&#10;In greater detail;&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill's (AH) Bismarck 1979/80 edition, designed by Jack Greene, is a totally different game from the AH 1962 edition designed by Lindsley Schutz and Charles Roberts.&#10;&#10;The game centered around the hunt for the KMS Bismarck and the KMS Prinz Eugen in mid-1941. The game has some similarities to the game Battleship, with both players having a hidden map-board and calling out co-ordinates to locate their opponent.&#10;&#10;There are two players, German and British. The British player has the task of placing the Royal Navy vessels and search aircraft on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a grid, with letters on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.&#10;Each turn the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), search for enemy units, and possibly engage in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &quot;shadow&quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the heavy cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.&#10;&#10;Eventually, British heavy units, such as the battle cruiser Hood, may be vectored into the same square as the German task force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the aircraft carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.&#10;&#10;The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &quot;breaking out&quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties into the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &quot;what if&quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German aircraft carrier, Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.&#10;&#10;Second edition changes included:&#10;&#10;     the square grid on the original map was replaced with a hexagonal overlay;  &#10;     the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships; &#10;     the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by more complex rules.&#10;     packaging was modified; the second edition coming in a smaller, standard-sized AH flat box (compared to the over-sized box of the first edition) and having alternative cover artwork.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

All the miniatures have values of speed and passing capabilities, and also 2-points and 3-points percentages values. Therefore players can manage the game as a real NBA game, trying to have the best player in the best shooting position for scoring. When a miniatures decides to shoot a 12-sided die is rolled and the result is eventually diminished by one if the miniature is marked. If the result is equal or lower than the miniature's shooting ability then there is a score.&#10;Situations like blocks, dunks, stealing the ball, illegal defenses, screening, free throws and faults add to the game a high likelihood.

This player wants to off as many other players as possible before someone catches his murderous wink and accuses him of the crimes.&#10;&#10;In Eye for an Eye, the players belong to a group of priests in Britannia known as the Ovates. From the rules: &quot;It is the dream of every Ovate to become a Druid, but the test is a terrible one requiring courage,intelligence and stamina.&quot; One to three Druids hide among the group of Ovates, and they can hypnotize an Ovate by winking at that players. The Druids don't know one another's identities, but if one Druid winks at another, the wink has no effect. The game ends when either only one Ovate remains unhypnotized (this player being the game's loser for failing to detect any Druids after so much opportunity) or an Ovate accuses someone of being a Druid (in which one or the other player is the game's loser). The loser must then perform the tests chosen by players at the start of the game from the included deck of 34 tests, with the test categories being &quot;Gallantry&quot;, &quot;Find Out About Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Be Shy&quot; and &quot;Surprise&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Austrlian Wink Death features a more traditional approach to the party game, with one player being the winker and up to 32 others being the winkees. The murder victims die in the manner depicted on their character card. Any player can accuse another of being the winker, but should the accusation prove incorrect, then both players are out and the game continues.

76873,,"This is a non-replay game based loosely on the 400 Metres track event. Eight players each control a single runner on a staggered lane track - special rules apply for 4 to 7 players.&#10;&#10;Each runner has fifteen Bid Tokens, totalling 100 points of Stamina, and for each of the eight Turns a Movement Card is exposed to show the Movement permitted for the top bidder, the second highest bidder, and so on. One or more of the tokens are placed face down in front of the player and the bids examined when all players have made up their minds.&#10;&#10;The highest bid claims the first Movement shown on the card, the second highest the second, etc, etc. A Tie-Break Card quickly settles the matter between equal bids. The used Bid Tokens are discarded, except for the Zero token which is taken back into the hand (useful to bluff with!) and the next Turn takes place using a new Movement Card.&#10;&#10;Some Movement Cards give a significant Movement advantage to the top bidder, others may have the top three positions gaining equal Movement, but the lower bidders are at a definite disadvantage. All 27 Movement Cards are different (eight are dealt randomly for each race), so bidding tactics and bluffing vary with each race.&#10;&#10;Four Movement Cards are on display when the race starts, the one used for the first Turn plus the next three Turns, and at each Turn another Movement Card is revealed, so some forward planning is possible - and necessary! And the staggered lanes means that the true position of the runners is not known until they enter the home straight which deliberately adds to the uncertainty.&#10;&#10;If heats and/or semi-finals are run half of the unused Stamina can be carried forward to the next round or Final, and in any event unused Stamina can help a runner 'win' a photo finish if runners are level after eight Turns.&#10;&#10;Although designed as a multi-player game for eight players the game can be played by as few as four players with the special rules provided.

These are then picked up. A player who holds cards of only one kind hits the coconut as fast as possible. Everyone else then puts their hand on it, too. The hands form an order.
