US soldiers joined forces with Wehrmacht infantrymen, an SS officer, an Austrian resistance fighter, and recently freed French prisoners of war to defend an Austrian castle against an attacking force from the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division.&#10;&#10; &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Object of the GameDuring a game of Castle Itter, you take the role of the force that defended the castle from 0400 - 1600 on 5 May 1945. The goal of the game is to last until the SS deck is depleted, without allowing SS Counters to reach the castle. You score points for each Defender that survives the assault and lose points for each SS Counter remaining on the board at the end of the game - the higher your score, the better. &#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game OverviewCastle Itter is divided into turns. Each turn consists of two phases:&#10;&#10;&bull; Defender Phase: Take five actions with Defender counters&#10;&bull; SS Phase: Play three SS cards&#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Defender PhaseDuring each turn you take five actions with your Defenders. You can only take one action with a Defender on a turn. When you take an action with a Defender, place an Action Token on the Defender.  If you use an action that exhausts a Defender, flip the Defender to its exhausted side. The actions include:&#10;&#10;&bull; Attack&#10;&bull; Suppress&#10;&bull; Move within a location&#10;&bull; Move to a new location&#10;&bull; Special Actions (Command and Escape)&#10;&bull; Recover&#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;SS PhaseOnce you have completed your five Defender actions for the turn, reveal three SS Cards from the SS deck, one at a time, resolving the effect of each one before moving to the next. After all three SS Cards have been resolved, discard them. The turn is over and the next turn begins with five new Defender actions.&#10;&#10;There are four different categories of SS Cards, based on the card effect:&#10;&#10;&bull; Attack Defenders&#10;&bull; Attack Location&#10;&bull; Disrupt Defenders&#10;&bull; Place SS Counters&#10;  &#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Ending the GameThe game ends at the end of the turn when the SS deck is exhausted or immediately if the 142nd Infantry Regiment card is drawn from the SS deck.&#10;&#10;"

You must watch out for the special cuts of cloth with negative values, however. They will boost your score if you place them next to each other, turning the negative values positive, but decrease your score if you don't plan carefully.&#10;&#10;After sewing a card into your cloak, you pass a different card than the one you received on to the next player.

Based on the number of characters, you will deal out a grid of Forest Cards. Each turn, every player will move their character(s) around the Forest and decide which Forest Cards to flip over to potentially expose Aliens, fiendish Traps, useful Gear, or valuable Allies.&#10;&#10;There are four levels of cards, with higher challenges requiring that players choose whether to hope for a lucky roll or to combine their unique Abilities and Gear to improve their chances of defeating powerful foes.&#10;&#10;To win, you and your friends must stay alive and clear the entire forest before the last turn. If any player is killed, or if the game ends before the Forest is cleared, then the Aliens overrun the City, and destroy humanity.&#10;&#10;"

Conversion Go is a territory game for two players, Black and White, who alternately put stones of their color on the board.&#10;&#10;2. The board is a 16x16 grid (counting the points rather than the squares). At the beginning the board is empty, with play taking place on the points.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Play3. A corner point is considered to belong to both edges that meet there.&#10;&#10;4. It is permissible to pass. If both players pass consecutively, the game concludes.&#10;&#10;5. It is not permissible to &quot;mirror&quot; the opponent's moves ten or more turns in succession.&#10;&#10;6. The beginning of the game is governed by a &quot;refined&quot; pie rule. Player 1 plays two moves for Black and one move for White. One or more of those moves can be passes. Player 2 then decides which side to take, with White to move.&#10;&#10;7. A group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to it. A dead group is a group that has no liberties and touches less than two sides of the board. To convert a group means to remove it from the board and replace it with stones of the opposite color. After a player's move, first all dead groups of the opponent's color are converted, then all dead groups of the player's color in the resulting position are converted.&#10;&#10;8. The game concludes when both players pass consecutively. Any stones that cannot escape conversion are now automatically converted. Each player then figures his score, which is the number of his stones on the board plus the territory (vacant points) they surround. The player with the higher score wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesDespite the fact that stones are converted and re-converted, the game can be played neatly with pen-and-paper. The reason is that the color of any &quot;X&quot;ed stones is always clear: it is the color of the living formation which ultimately encloses them.&#10;&#10;If played on an odd-sized board by players trying to win, the game will never end in a tie. Oddly enough, this is possible thanks to the fact that suicide moves are allowed, as this prevents local impasses (&quot;seki&quot;) with an odd number of points in them.&#10;&#10;"

As the game progresses, players will hire more gambler cards, receive larger number cards, and earn more coins. The major way to win the game is to earn 15 or more coins.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he may hire a new gambler as long as he can pay the cost. Hired gamblers are laid down face-up in front of the player.&#10;&#10;On the gambler card, there is a target number and reward amount. For example, there is a gambler card with target number 5 and reward amount 3.&#10;&#10;After optionally hiring a new gambler, the player who begins the round plays a number card face up. For the initial round, it would be 1 or 0. Then, other players play one of their number cards face down. After that, reveal all the number cards and add up the numbers. If that total equals the number of a gambler cards, any player who hired that gambler gets the reward accordingly.&#10;&#10;Play continues this way until a player collects 15 coins or more. The player with the most coins is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Players will race to the top of the galactic corporate ladder.&#10;&#10;Each player uses their spaceship token to hyper jump around the section of space to make their mark in the most powerful corporation in the galaxy.  The section of space is comprised of 80 cards setup in an 8 x 10 grid. When a player lands on an unexplored card, they flip it over to reveal what is there. Before the game begins, each player is given 5 Career Goal cards they must complete.&#10;&#10;The progression of game play is divided into Fiscal Periods and each fiscal period is done in steps:&#10;Step 1. Solar Jellies Move and Spawn&#10;Step 2. Players receive their budgets&#10;Step 3. Players spend 1 photon to File Paperwork to the corporation.&#10;Step 4. Players choose ** to do an action or enter a coordinate on their dual dials. Then, dials are revealed. Actions happen before movements.&#10;Step 5. Players repeat by Filing Paperwork and moving/doing actions (Step 3-4) until all players run out of Photons or choose not to File Paperwork.&#10;&#10;Players File Paperwork in order to complete Career Goals that allow them to influence five departments. When a player completes a goal, they flip that card over next to their Player Board and put in the appropriate amount of influence cards to the Department Heads Board.&#10;&#10;The players use what they find as they reveal the section of space (grid of cards) to fulfill career goal conditions:&#10;1. Destroy 1 space pirate&#10;2. Upgrade your spaceship to level 3 (if you have 2 of this goal, the second goal is completed by upgrading to a level 4)&#10;3. Find 2 relics (to complete the goal subsequent times, you only need 1 relic for each Career Goal card)&#10;4. Give 3 photons to the Accounting Department&#10;5. Destroy 5 Space Jellies (to complete the goal subsequent times, you only need to destroy 2 more Space Jellies for each Career Goal card)&#10;&#10;When one player completes their fifth and final Career Goal, a vote is triggered. The player that completes their final Career Goal stops playing and all other players are allowed to spend their remaining Photons for that fiscal period (unless they also complete their final career goal, at which point they stop as well).&#10;&#10;Each of the five department piles of influence cards are shuffled separately.  One card is drawn from each department pile.  A player wins by having a majority (3 out of 5 departments) of their cards drawn.  If no hard majority exists, the player who gets 2 soft majorities (2 out of 5 departments, twice) wins.  The player with the most votes wins the job of Galactic CEO!&#10;&#10;"

Turns last about 1 minute, and a game lasts 30-45 minutes. It is designed as a two-player experience, but it scales well and could be played with 3-4 players if you combine two games.&#10;&#10;Players control outlaw crews zooming from battle site to battle site in deep space. The goal is to be the first to arrive, pick through the flotsam and derelicts to find the salvageable wreckage, and escape back to the nearest planet. There are shady deals and scams to be run on the side, too.&#10;&#10;Navy patrols wander the area, intent on keeping pirates, bandits, and smugglers in line. The patrols monitor each player's &quot;wanted level.&quot; When a player has a high enough bounty or is caught with contraband too many times, the patrols will chase them down and exact revenge. Sometimes a ship's own activities will make them more wanted; sometimes a reliable tip off from a rival crew will do the trick.&#10;&#10;This game consists of three components:&#10;&#10;Cover &amp; Rules - 80# text paper;&#10;Board - 16 pt cover stock;&#10;Counter Sheets - 38 pt die cut chipboard.&#10;&#10;Devils &amp; Black Sheep has a simple 3-part turn sequence.&#10;&#10;1. Place New Wrecks: This is accomplished by rolling the die and following a placement matrix to determine where rumors of wreckage will lead you.&#10;&#10;2. Navy Patrols Act: This will be a tame part of the game early on, but as your Wanted Levels increase from all your shady activities, it could get nasty.&#10;&#10;3. Players Act: Choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;Bribe: donate to an election campaign in exchange for a reduction in wanted level&#10;Bounty: place a bounty on a ship to increase its wanted level&#10;Fence: sell some of your loot to the local chop shop&#10;Raid: attack an opponent and steal some of their stuff&#10;Salvage: explore nearby flotsam for something of value&#10;Move: pretty self explanatory&#10;Smuggle: sell dark energy on the black market ... VERY illegal stuff&#10;&#10;Degrees of Success - After choosing an action, players roll to see how well their action succeeded. The roll determines how successful your action was. This game specifically avoids the polarized success/failure result that commonly turns choices into all-or-nothing deals, and instead replaces it with a gambling mechanic.&#10;&#10;Players roll the dice at the beginning of each turn to determine whether new reports of a recent battle reach the rumor mill of the local cantina. The rolls determine how much wreckage is rumored (some battles are larger than others, of course ... just as some rumors are more outlandish than others), and the sector and distance from the planet. These wrecks are derelict ships abandoned or destroyed in a recent battle. Every wreck has the potential to be salvaged for valuable (ish) flotsam, but the actual amount of salvageable junk won't be known until you arrive and check it out.&#10;&#10;The local Navy Patrols then roll to see whether they are ordered to bring any of the outlaw crews to justice. Sometimes the patrols will simply move around and harass players. Sometimes they will bring the full might of their patrol to bear.&#10;&#10;The higher the player's &quot;wanted level,&quot; the more likely a patrol will take notice and give chase. Wanted levels can increase by getting caught in your illegal activity, and can also be increased by other players placing bounties on your ship. Your wanted level decreases by either being attacked by the local patrol, or by bribing officials to reduce it.&#10;&#10;"
