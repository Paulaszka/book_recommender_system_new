The Merchant guild is ready to pay outrageous amounts of money, and all the Seekers roam about to find them. Breaking news!

In a few days, a new gold race will begin, with men replaced by robots that search, explore and fight to control the precious mineral!&#10;&#10;The Forgotten Planet is a tile-laying management game in which tiles represent safe areas on a planetary surface on which robots walk and take other actions. These tiles also accumulate energy from the sun, then conduct it to robots, giving them (and the player) more actions if they absorb enough energy &ndash; so building and maintaining ownership of these tiles is fundamental in the game strategy. Players and robots use this energy to build new bases, discover mines, build walls to keep out other robots, push those same walls out of the way, produce more robots and much more.&#10;&#10;If your robot falls out of contact with tiles you control, however, then it loses power and falls inactive for the round. Control of tiles is determined by the distance from a particular tile to each player's closest base; whoever is closest to the tile (with walls serving as barriers that players must &quot;walk&quot; around while counting distance) controls it, and the more tiles you control, the more energy you have available to you.&#10;&#10;Thus, players need to maintain an energy connection for their robots while trying to extend their area of control on the planet's surface with their bases. They also need to control mines, of course, as that's how a player produces new resources, which are subsequently converted into new bases, sold for victory points (VPs) or converted into new robots.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the playing area is filled with tiles or no land tiles remain in the supply. (Players can &quot;consume metal&quot; as one of their actions to speed along the endgame and crimp someone else's efforts to keep building.) Players then score points for the land and mines they control, with bonuses going to the player(s) with the most robots in play, the most common mines and the most bases. The player with the high score wins.&#10;&#10;"

However, it has the fewest exclusive rules of the three games currently in the series (Saipan &amp; Tinian and Attu &amp; Kiska). This means that it should be the easiest and quickest to learn. The large size of the island allows both players to employ a wide variety of strategy options. As with most of the other games in the series, the victory conditions do not focus on geographic locations. The situation is simply a fight between both sides.&#10;&#10;Planning is the first step, and quite possibly the most important one too. The US player has to examine the Japanese dispositions, by looking over the map and using the limited intelligence rules to try to figure out where the Japanese main defenses are. Next in the planning cycle is to pick landing locations and then select the composition and order of your beachheads and landing forces. Once the US player lands on the island he has to eliminate the Japanese units. That is a pretty simple goal, but it may not be as easy as it sounds! You have to do it within the game&rsquo;s time limit. He will have to find that perfect balance between time, maneuver, and combat. Too slow, cautious, or methodical and you run out of time. Too impatient and aggressive and you will suffer too many casualty points to win.&#10;&#10;In Guam the Japanese player has many options; the most of all the games in the series. You still have many of the same conditions as the other games, such as fortifications, being outnumbered, defending against an overwhelming invasion, and your opponent has air and naval superiority. However, you have a large enough force on a large enough island to allow far more opportunity for maneuvering. The Japanese player also has a variety of terrain types to incorporate into his defense. The clever use of dummy positions can fool the US player, making him attack unmanned positions or chasing scattered dummy units all over the map. But as in all the games, the Japanese player must have a well thought out plan with several courses of action in mind. Fortifications and dummies must be well placed in anticipation of US player moves.&#10;&#10;The Series&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion.&#10;&#10;Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile.&#10;&#10;Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours.&#10;&#10;The Pacific Island Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II. Each game in the system represents a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese forces on one of the many Pacific Islands. The series includes Saipan/Tinian -Vol. I,  Guam - Vol. II and Attu &amp; Kiska - Vol. III.&#10;&#10;Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Pacific Island Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.&#10;&#10;The focus of the series is on the land battles of the Pacific, therefore all naval and air forces are abstract. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. For example, one player can play the US Marines, one can play the US Army, and the third plays the Japanese.&#10;&#10;This series of games is loosely based on or inspired by several different game systems, including SPI's Island War series and GRD/GDW's Europa series, but many concepts are quite original. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &quot;against the odds&quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart. This also puts a lot of pressure on the attacker because he cannot afford to make many mistakes.&#10;&#10;Game features include:&#10;&#10;1. Limited intelligence.&#10;2. Amphibious Landings&#10;3.

One player takes the role of Marlborough, commanding the British and Allied forces, and the other of Tallard, leading the Franco-Bavarians.  At Blenheim Marlborough found himself confronting a superior Franco-Bavarian force in a strong defensive position. Like Hannibal's great victory at Cannae, Blenheim was won by the successful implementation of a bold and imaginative plan. The flanks of the Franco-Bavarian forces were pinned by furious attacks at unfavourable odds which denuded their centre of troops re-deployed to buttress the hard-pressed wings. Then Marlborough released his cavalry to smash what was left of Franco-Bavarian centre and cleave Tallard's army into two. The threat that Louis XIV's France would come to dominate Europe was over.&#10;&#10;The Seven Hex System (SHS) derives its name from the map which is divided into areas comprised of seven hexes which enables the player to adopt various positions within an area to reflect different tactical formations thereby making it more likely that an attack will succeed or defending units will stand firm.   The SHS incorporates several unique features intended to replicate in a simple and intuitive way the options available to a commander (the wargamer) of a large army.  So whilst the commander has complete freedom to devise a plan, and a good deal when positioning units which have yet to encounter the enemy, once battle is joined the options become increasingly limited and unforeseen events can play a part in determining the outcome of events but the commander can still influence these at a tactical level. The key to success is a sound plan with a margin for error which allows for ill-fortune, the shrewd deployment of units so as to be able to implement that plan, and the timely commitment of reserves.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    22&quot; x 34&quot; Game Map&#10;    176 - EasyPunch 6/10&quot; Counters&#10;    16 pages Game Rules&#10;    3 Charts Player Aids&#10;&#10;&#10;"

One player represents France and her colonial troops. The other player represents the armed force of Viet Minh, the communist/nationalist independence movement of Vietnam. This is a cage fight. There are no victory points, there is no marginal victory and there is no draw. Viet Minh wins by forcing the French troops to surrender. France wins by not surrendering.&#10;&#10;Map and scale: The map covers the former village of Dien Bien Phu and surrounding areas. There is a small submap of the French strongpoint &quot;Isabelle&quot; further south in the valley. There are several groups of French strongpoints scattered around the map, each one with a female name (all named after the commander - de Castries' - mistresses, according to lore). The map is divided into three divisional sectors (plus a fourth one facing the submap &quot;Isabelle&quot;). Each sector has several zones that represent Viet Minh trenches winding from the map edge towards the center of the map. Each hex represents 150 meters and each game turn covers three days. There are 21 turns in the game, but historically, it ended after 19 game turns with a Viet Minh victory. The scale allows stacking of three French units (usually infantry companies) in a hex, but there are no stacking limits for Viet Minh battalions, which creates a chess feel.&#10;&#10;Three Viet Minh battalions form a regiment and three regiments become a division and there were almost four full divisions in the valley, as well as a full artillery division off map. There was also an equivalent of another three divisions in a replacement pool outside the valley. The French troops were a colorful array of colonial paras, Vietnamese troops, units from French Algeria and Morocco, and, of course, the French Foreign Legion. Some units are of average quality, some are outright terrible, but some are the very best that could be mustered ... anywhere. A French battalion consisted of four companies and there were 12 battalions together with 11 auxiliary light companies at the start of the siege, as well as 16 artillery and mortar batteries, and three tank platoons. Waiting in Hanoi were another five para battalions together with an expected replacement pool of about 14 companies. In neighboring Laos, there were four battalions ready to march and perhaps save the day at the very end.&#10;&#10;French supply: This battle took place far out in the wilderness of Vietnam and both sides had to adjust to the limited flow of supplies that could be brought forward, though the air to the French, and through vast forests to the Viet Minh. Supplies, as historically was the case, tend to be a lot less than wished for. There are several supply tracks on the map showing how much ammo, food &amp; bullets, fuel &amp; spares, medicine as well as the amount of truck transport available for the French. Each game turn air transports will bring in a mix of supplies together with replacements and reinforcements. This is done on a chart with a grid where a mix of supply markers are placed together with eventual reinforcements and replacements. Weather will then decide what will arrive and what will abort back to Hanoi. The French player will never know for sure what and how much will arrive and has to take that into account.&#10;&#10;Viet Minh supply and morale: Viet Minh will receive a more steady flow of ammunition, but not enough to barrage whenever wished. There is a large pool of replacements to use, but although it is large, it is not infinite. If Viet Minh losses are too heavy, then the fact that you can only replace one step per regiment per game turn will be a painful experience. If loses are too heavy for too long, then the pool will dry out. Viet Minh's main concern is troop morale. The battle force starts with excellent morale, but each division's morale will decrease when taking replacements thus diluting the experienced veterans with newly drafted peasants with no combat experience. Morale will rise slightly when resting (not assaulting). But then again, time flies and there is a battle to win. Morale is a very important part of the game and if it falls too low, the troops will be rendered useless.&#10;&#10;Artillery: Artillery is another important aspect of the battle. There is bombardment from both sides before assaults commence. You wish to achieve two things with barrage: Losses and to make the target shaken. Targets that are shaken lose abilities to react and support combat, and they become easier to assault. Defending units bring in barrage to make it harder for the attacker to succeed. Viet Minh artillery is off-board and safe from French artillery fire (mainly that they were dug deep into the mountainsides). French artillery and mortar units, on the other hand, exist as units on the board and may fall prey to Viet Minh bombardment. French artillery units that are reduced and/or shaken are not as efficient, and those that are eliminated are obviously out of play. Both sides have a limited amount of ammunition and therefore have to spend it wisely.&#10;&#10;Combat: The main effort in the game is, of course, the assaults. Each player will conduct two die-rolls during the course of an assault to determine the outcome. The defender first conducts defensive fire in the hopes of inflicting losses, but also to possibly force the attacker abort the assault. The defender&rsquo;s first die roll is compared to their strength and will show how well they defend. The defender&rsquo;s second die-roll (modified from the result of the first die roll), is compared to the assaulting unit's morale and will determine the result of the defensive fire. Providing the assaulting units do not abort, the attacker (who has suffered the effects of the defensive fire) conducts two die rolls. The first one to see how well the assault is conducted, and the second one to see the outcome of the assault. Modifications, such as trenches, terrain, support from other units, etc., adjust the strength of a unit to make it stronger or weaker.&#10;&#10;You will never know for sure what that result will be due to the two die-rolls on each side. Dien Bien Phu &ndash; The Final Gamble, will be as tense and brutal a simulation as was the historical battle that determined the fate of this war as well as shaping the events of things to come.&#10;&#10;Kim Kanger&#10;&#10;"

In June of that year, 1,000 Fenians, many of them Civil War veterans, marched into Ontario and were confronted by an equal number of Canadian militia. The Battle of Ridgeway ensued, and ended with the Canadians leaving the field to the Fenians. British regulars were on the way, so the Fenians had to make their escape back into New York. Four years later, the Fenians tried again, this time in Quebec, but things had changed. Canada was now and independent country and the militia system had changed as well. The Battle of Eccles Hill showed how militia could stand up to an invader - the Fenians were repulsed.
