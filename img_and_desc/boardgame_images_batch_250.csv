Each vessel needs a certain combination of goods. The players take the roles of traders, trying to fill their warehouses with goods which are then in turn transferred to the ships in the harbor. They have to pay attention to the right combination of goods because the captains only accept the goods from a single trader and expect a complete delivery before their ships leave the harbor. It is also very important to not let the right moment to transfer goods to the vessels pass, because the fleet will leave the harbor when the storage space is full and the winds are helpful. The players always have to be before the wind to actively influence the events.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;     120 action cards&#10;     60 goods cards&#10;     60 Guilders cards&#10;     46 ship cards&#10;     4 warehouses&#10;     1 starting player token&#10;     1 rules booklet&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The tokens consist of one blank token and 36 tokens in six colors and six symbols, with each combination appearing once. (In earlier versions of the game, tokens were valued 1-6 in each of six different symbols, with one hex being left empty.) The blank token fills space and serves only as a barrier.&#10;&#10;To start, the black player places one of their pawns on a perimeter space that touches only one side of the hex. The token on this space, e.g. the red fish, indicates where the white player must place one of their pawns on the next turn, either on a red token or on a fish token, and the white player's pawn constrains where the black player can next place a pawn. Players continue taking turns in this manner, and the game ends immediately when one of three victory conditions are fulfilled:&#10;&#10;&#10;     A player connects two opposite edges of the grid with their pawns (as in Hex).&#10;     A player surrounds one or more hexes with a loop of their pawns without regard as to whether those hexes are empty or occupied by the opponent's pawns.&#10;     A player prevents their opponent from placing a pawn, e.g. by occupying the yellow mountain when no more yellow tokens or mountain tokens are available.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The players each champion one of six characters: Jack the Ripper, The Inspector, Lady Coverup, Lord Brutal, Mr. Revenge and Pretty Nell (everyone's victim). Each character has conflicting goals which lead them to try to pin the murders on one another or try to capture or protect Jack. The game plays in a whirl wind of back stabbing.&#10;&#10;Each turn players pick a question from the game board to answer. Another player judges how likely it is to happen. A roll is made and the action happens or doesn't. If it happens it becomes a fact. Facts add up to tell the story. Players can interrupt answers with counter-arguments that are resolved with a dice rolling contest. This is a beginner game that can be played by anyone. It is about a murderer though so there is plenty of violence.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 16x21 color laminated sheet that folds up into a 8x10.5 folio for storage. There is a separate laminated rules sheet that stores in the folio. The back side of the sheet has the front and back of the folio and an example of play. The game board side of the sheet has a game opening narrative, a cast of six characters (each with a picture and short written description) and a large picture with plot driving questions listed on it.

An ordinary pack is used, from which the eight of diamonds has been removed, and a special round board in the form of eight compartments, named respectively Pope-Joan, Matrimony, Intrigue, Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game (King, Queen and Knave are sometimes omitted).&#10;&#10;Each player &ndash; any number can play &ndash; contributes a stake, of which one counter is put into the divisions Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game, two into Matrimony and Intrigue, and the rest into Pope-Joan. This is called &quot;dressing the board.&quot; The cards are dealt round, with an extra hand for &quot;stops,&quot; i.e. cards which stop, by their absence, the completion of a suit; thus the absence of the nine of spades stops the playing of the ten. The last card is turned up for trumps.&#10;&#10;Cards in excess may be dealt to &quot;stops,&quot; or an agreed number may be left for the purpose, so that all players may have an equal number of cards. If an honor or &quot;Pope&quot; (nine of diamonds) is turned up, the dealer takes the counters in the compartment so marked. Sometimes the turning-up of Pope settles the hand, the dealer taking the whole pool. The Ace is the lowest card, the King the highest. The player on the dealer's left plays a card and names it, the player who has the next highest then plays it, till a stop is played, i.e. a card of which no one holds the next highest. All Kings are of course stops, also the seven of diamonds; also the cards next below the dealt stops, and the cards next below the played cards. After a stop the played cards are turned over, and the player of the stop (the card last played) leads again.&#10;&#10;The player who gets rid of all his cards first takes the counters in &quot;Game,&quot; and receives a counter from each player for every card left in his hand, except from the player who may hold Pope but has not played it. The player of Ace, King, Queen or Knave of trumps takes the counters from that compartment. If King and Queen of trumps are in one hand, the holder takes the counters in &quot;Matrimony&quot;, if a Queen and Knave, those in &quot;Intrigue&quot;, if all three, those in the two compartments; if they are in different hands these counters are sometimes divided. Unclaimed stakes are left for the next pool. Pope is sometimes considered a universal &quot;stop.&quot;&#10;&#10;Re-implements: Jeu du Nain Jaune&#10;&#10;"
