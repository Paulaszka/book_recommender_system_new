The store consists of a number of departments, which each need to be filled with stock.  Customers come to the store with a list of items that need to be bought.  If all items are sold by a single player's department store, then that player wins that customer.  If the customer still has items remaining to be bought, then they move onto the next player's department.&#10;&#10;This is mainly a card-based game, where customers, items to be bought, and departments are represented by cards, and stock is represented by small wooden cubes.  On a player's turn, they can choose a customer from 3 available customers, who each have a number of items that they want to buy, the number of which are decided by the roll of a dice.  Only the number of items to buy is visible to the player, not the actual items themselves, so it's only when the customer is chosen that the items are revealed and the player knows what can be sold.  Players receive money for items sold, which can then be used to buy new stock or new departments at the end of their turn.&#10;&#10;The game relies on players choosing the right departments to set up, depending on what other players have already chosen, and deciding which departments should get restocked and at what time, especially when money is limited.  A player wins by being the player with the highest number of customers that had all items sold during one turn.

Players have to think in original twists an plot lines for their story, which they make up as they go along, for the entertainment of the other players and anyone else who is listening.&#10;The game begins when a player (the Storyteller) selects a Story Card and reads out the caption upon it, which will be the first line of a story that has yet to be created. The other players then ask the Storyteller creative and difficult to answer questions and play a letter or word Question Card. The Storyteller must develop his or her story ad hoc. This must be done using the specific word on the Question Card in the answer, or beginning the answer with the letter featured on the Question Card, depending which type was played.&#10;Players then have an opportunity to challenge an answer that they feel doesn't make sense, and all players would then vote to validate or discard an answer. If an answer gets discarded, the Storyteller's turn ends.&#10;&#10;Whilst primarily designed as a party game for fun, answers can be awarded points if players wish to keep score. Once everyone has been the Storyteller, the player with the most points would win.&#10;&#10;"
