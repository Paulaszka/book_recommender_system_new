9178,,"From the rulebook: &quot;In the game, each player assumes the role of a water pollution control official who is responsible for stocking his lake. He does so by collecting appropriate organisms as he moves around the game board, confronting the problems of water pollution each time he lands on a 'pollution' triangle. Throughout the game he must learn to anticipate possible pollution of his lake, attempt to avoid the problem of overpopulation, manage his finances efficiently, and consider the problem of possible pollution coming from upstream. A player wins the game by controlling water pollution successfully and thereby being the first to completely stock his lake.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player is the Commissioner of Water Pollution for their own lake.  Each lake is connected by a series of rivers and surrounded by potential polluters.  The first player to completely stock his lake with organisms while controlling the pollution from the nearby community of farms, industries and residential developments is the winner.  Clean Water acquaints players with some of the complexities involved with dealing different types of pollutants while maintaining a healthy ecosystem.&#10;&#10;Players roll a die to move around the board and collect organisms for their lakes. Landing on a pollution space will kill off some of the higher organisms and increase the lower organisms, but players can purchase Abatement cards to try to avoid the pollution. Overpopulation of any one type of critter will also disturb the ecology, but players can occasionally exchange lower organisms for higher ones. Players also have opportunities to bid for federal funding. The first player to fill his lake with the required organisms wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The players lay color rows out before themselves using their snail maps. Each player tries to protect  their color rows as quickly as possible, because only those cards score when they are played.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 110 cards with different moves for snails on them. Among them are colored snails, Schnarchschnecken, snails cards and turbo-snails. To begin play, all cards are mixed and each player is dealt 5 cards for their hand. In addition 3 sets of snail cards are laid out in the center of the table. (thus again in each case 5 pieces) are laid out. These form the exchange supply.&#10;&#10;If a player puts the fifth snail into a color row, this row is protected. Those cards are put aside and are counted as one point per card. Added to his own snail cards,  the player receives a card with  same color numbers as the other players. There is also a wild card color which can be added. That card is is collected by all, is thus particularly lucrative but in  addition it is risky to try and collect  . By means of this pfiffigen mechanism the author achieves a high interaction between the players. These are practically always into the play merged.&#10;&#10;The special snail maps bring an additional attraction into the play. With the Schnarchschnecke a  player is forced to an obligation break by a round. With a turbo-snail   can   lock even if  5 cards do not  lie in the row. And finally the card snails: These serve to allow a player to exchange a card from his hand with one the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Part of the Goldsieber &#195;&#160; la Carte line of games.&#10;&#10;"

9192,,"Justinian is a strategic level board-wargame game set in the early 6th century, after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the burgeoning of the Byzantine Eastern Roman Empire.  The Byzantine Emperor, Justinian I, has started his reconquest of the Western Roman Empire, and the game attempts to simulate his endeavor for players to emulate.&#10;&#10;One player takes on Justinian's role, the other coordinates the Barbarian faction (basically the non-Byzantines); the designer also said the game can be played solitaire.  The two factions' design are asymmetrical.  Each turn, the Byzantine has to manage its finances, gaining income by taxing its controlled provinces and spending the money to raise and maintain its armies.  Then the Barbarian and Byzantine factions alternate with each other to take actions (one at a time).  They can raise more armies, move the troops, or do nothing.  Whereas the extent of the Byzantine faction's orders are certainties, most of the Barbarian faction's are random; i.e. dice rolls sometimes determine how many armies join the Barbarians and whether these armies join the Byzantines instead.  Both sides conquer territories by moving their armies into the lands.  If two armies meet, combat occurs, which is resolved by dice rolls and cross checking the results with tables.  The game features mutinies, naval actions, and random events.  The latter throws up revolts, removal of generals and plagues.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 10 turns or after a second plague has erupted.  The Byzantine faction has to control a certain majority of the empire by that time to win.  The game also ends if the reconquest was accomplished much earlier.  If the Byzantine faction is unable to win when the game ends, the Barbarian faction is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;JUSTINIAN is a game covering the reconquest of the Roman Empire by Justinian I, Emperor of Eastern Rome (Byzantium). Justinian&rsquo;s reign represents Byzantium&rsquo;s high water mark; his conquest of lands is exceeded in Roman history only by that of Augustus and Trajan.&#10;&#10;Players. The game may be played by two players, or solitaire.[...]&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;"

9197,,"Seven Years War is a simulation of the war between Prussia and a Coalition of European states, 1756-1764, published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #163 (Sep 1993). While militarily a stalemate, the war consolidated Prussia's dominance of central Europe until its defeat at Jena and Auerstadt in 1806.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for two players or two teams. The Prussian Allied side, opposes the Coalition side. The objective is to gain control of as many central european fortress cities as possible without losing control of your own. The rules consist of a Standard Game that gives a relatively simple but historically valid game, and an Advanced Game providing a more complete historical simulation. Play centers around the operational activity of moving armies, fighting battles and besieging fortresses. However, this operational activity is heavily influenced by, and is intertwined with, the ever changing strategic choices and actions the players take as the game proceeds. This game is falling through the cracks in recent years. There is a reasonably good Cyberboard gamebox but it would be nice if someone would create a Vassal module as well.&#10;&#10;Operational aspects include leaders, a variable movement table, discipline classes for units, logistics with supply wagons and foraging, and limited intelligence. Forces are comprised of infantry, cavalry, light troops, pioneers and artillery. Combat is modified by battleplan chits, selected before the die is rolled, that allow a player to emphasize line infantry, or more elite units, or cavalry achieving strength bonuses or die roll modifiers. The combat table produces percentage loss and moral checks for one or both sides. One learns that strength is not always the deciding factor. Leadership, high discipline, moral and making use of unit specialization play a big roll. Fortresses can also be captured by siege combat.&#10;&#10;Strategically, the game makes use of random events, diplomacy, (the various European states get pushed in and out of neutrality and switch sides). Winning battles can give a player diplomatic options. As the game proceeds the progress of both sides is recorded on the Balance of Power track which can also modify victory. It is possible for both sides to achieve a victory. The two are then compared to give a final victory. Also, both sides can lose if the Balance of Power track moves too far toward one of the players. Restraint is part of a player's strategic considerations.&#10;&#10;The game is complete by magazine game standards. The errata is light. It is not a simple game and it requires players to be willing to roleplay the point of view of the leaders from that period. There is a four turn short scenario covering the first year of the conflict. A full campaign game can last as long as 28 turns if things are drawn out. It is a highly replayable game.&#10;&#10;Errata and Q&amp;A for 7YW were published in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 165, 166, 167, and 169.&#10;Additional counters for 7YW were included in Strategy &amp; Tactics #s 170 and 171. &#10;7YW also received extensive coverage in Moves #79.&#10;&#10;"

9201,,"Spies are conducting business on all of the continents. Everyone wants to employ as many spies as possible of course. Six cards are lying in the middle of the table, each representing a continent, as well as six cards depicting typical spy tools. Before the start of the game, a spy-chip is placed beside each card.&#10;&#10;Each player holds three cards in his hand and places one openly in front of him during each round. The cards always show two symbols: a continent and a tool. Players can &ldquo;report&rdquo; two or more cards with the same symbol when it is their turn. For this purpose, he or she can use hand cards, those in front of him or both. One may then lay down the difference of one&rsquo;s cards and the already displayed chips as spy chips. If a player lays down three South America cards for instance, and there is only one spy attached to that continent card, he may lay down the difference (2 spies) out of his supply.&#10;&#10;As the game continues, it becomes increasingly difficult to lay down spies. For example, if there are already 4 spies at the &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo;, a player needs to report at least 5 cards with &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo; in order to get rid of a spy. One also has to catch the right moment for reporting, because reporting too early means one might only get rid of very few spies. If one waits too long, others might be quicker. The player who gets rid of his spies first wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Different planes use different decks of movement cards to represent their different maneuver capabilities, and different deck of &quot;Fire&quot; card are used to take into account their fighting effectiveness and to keep track of damage.&#10;&#10;Each Wings of War set is a complete game for 2 to 4 players which may be combined with additional sets, or with other copies of the same set, to play larger games.

9216,,"Goa, a strategy game of auctions and resource management, is set at the start of the 16th century: beautiful beaches, a mild climate, and one of the most important trading centers in the world. Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.&#10;&#10;Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.&#10;&#10;After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track. On the other hand, each player normally needs to perform the actions for all the tracks at some point, so it's not necessarily a good idea to concentrate on just a couple of them. Goa is a game that gives plenty of opportunity for tough decisions, since a player always has at least one action too few.&#10;&#10;The game mixes an interactive element of the auction, which encourages you to nominate things that other players want so you receive cash with the solitaire management of your plantation, which then interacts later on as players race to be first in the top tech levels.&#10;&#10;The 2012 edition of Goa includes four new tiles and a new play variant, as noted on the cover of the Z-Man Games edition.&#10;&#10;"

But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.&#10;&#10;With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card.

9232,,"Rebel Yell is a simulation of American Civil War small-unit tactics. The playing pieces in the game represent companies of infantry and cavalry or sections of artillery Each infantry and cavalry unit has one strength point and is equivalent to between 45 and 100 men, depending upon the scenario. Each artillery unit has two strength points and equals two guns. The players of Rebel Yell assume the roles of divisional commanders.&#10;&#10;Each game turn is broken down into segments. During an action segment, the units of a particular player may conduct a single action. In the beginning modules these actions are: Move, Fire, Assault, and Rally. During any Small Arms segment, the units of a particular player may only fire.&#10;&#10;There are no movement phases, fire phases, etc., as there are in other Civil War games. This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.&#10;&#10;One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the &ldquo;problem of approach,&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of &ldquo;modern&rdquo; weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.&#10;&#10;Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.&#10;&#10;Once players have learned all the rules (or even before), they can design their own scenarios. The game includes six geomorphic maps. Because the maps can be aligned in a variety of ways, the players can recreate a &ldquo;microscopic&rdquo; examination of virtually any Civil War engagement.&#10;&#10;Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area.

Four battles are represented in a single box: Marston Moor, Naseby, Justice Mills and Kilsyth.&#10;&#10;Royalists and Roundheads contains four of the most important battles of the English Civil War. Taking place at the dawn of modern warfare, the war led to the creation of the New Model army, the basis of the British army until the start of the twentieth century. As the pike and tercio failed, the gun rose to become the most important tool of the infantry. The English Civil War was the testing ground for these new weapons of destruction.&#10;&#10;The game features an innovative, easy to use command system, that recreates the problems of command in an elegant and simple way. Leaders are rated for command, initiative and combat. Weapons range from pikes, muskets and artillery to bows and lances. Each of the four games is complete in itself, and can be played in 1-1/2 to 3 hours, with the ever-present possibility of one side or the other triggering an automatic victory.&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to get rid of one's cards by making or adding to combinations of cards on the table and forming sets and runs of cards. The player who first gets rid of all his ten cards wins the hand and is paid by each of the other players 3 chips for each card they have left in their hands.&#10;&#10;

The game recreates the events of October 7-9th, 1862, both what actually happened and what might have been...&#10;&#10;In the fall of 1862, the young Rebel nation launched two invasions into border state territory. One ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam. The other&mdash;lesser known&mdash;effort culminated in the Battle of Perryville. Bragg&rsquo;s campaign to seize Kentucky from the North was of critical importance. A crippling blow dealt here would have transferred the war from Tennessee (and further south) to the Ohio River. U.S. Grant&rsquo;s efforts at Fort Donelson and Shiloh would have been voided. The war in the west would be fundamentally altered in the South&rsquo;s favor. As it was, Bragg was unable to bring in the available Confederate forces and fight a decisive battle against Buell. In this game, however, the player can take an active hand in drawing on all the Southern forces to bring on the battle that might have been.&#10;&#10;With one map and 280 counters, Perryville makes an excellent starter game for players new to the successful Civil War, Brigade game series. With both the latest edition of the rules and a smaller battle to work with, new players will be able to quickly garner the skills needed to compete successfully in the other (larger) series games.&#10;&#10;Perryville is game number 6 in the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series by The Gamers (now Multi-Man Publishing).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 30 minutes&#10;Hex: 200 yards&#10;Unit: Infantry/Cavalry Brigades &amp; Artillery Battalions&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; full-color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 32 page CWBS 2nd edition revised Rulebook&#10;One 8 page Perryville Rulebook&#10;Two six-sided dice&#10;&#10;Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)&#10;Playing Time: 4-16 Hours (varies with scenario played)&#10;Complexity: Moderate&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;&#10;"

Each turn consists of moving one of your pawns and placing a card. To begin with, pawns can only move one square forwards or backwards and cannot capture your opponent's pawns. However, once a pawn is moved, a movement card is placed onto the square it vacates. Movement cards have arrows showing possible moves - directions and lengths. The more possible directions (eight being the maximum) the card shows, the shorter the maximum move. Pawns which begin their move on one of these cards follow one of the arrows and are allowed to capture enemy pawns. When a pawn moves off a movement card, the next movement card may be placed in any vacant space on the board, in any orientation. Thus there is scope for clever placement to limit what your opponent can do. Gradually the board fills up with movement cards which show the possible moves from each square. Moves are essentially chess-like, but some are more limited, for example some movement cards allow movement in a straight line in only three directions, or diagonally in only two.&#10;&#10;The game ends either when one player has captured all their opponent's pawns; when one player loses due to having no legal move; or when all 36 movement cards are placed, in which case the winner is the one with the most remaining cones.&#10;&#10;"

Cones can capture opposing cones or land on opposing checkers; this does not capture them but prevents them from moving.&#10;&#10;The object is to get a checker to the opposite end of the board without a cone being able to immediately move onto it.&#10;&#10;The first version of the game, Chafts, used a set of six cards showing Chess moves for the cones.

Opposing armies deployed in sight of each other, just beyond maximum missile range, and received the sacraments before the engagement began. When &ldquo;infidels&rdquo; fought against them, European Christians displayed a special fervor to conquer all before them. Ironically, there were occasions, such as the sack of Rome in 1084, when commanders dispensed with the sacraments owing to the mixed composition of their armies. Feudal cavalry was the dominant battle winning component for most armies in this period, but its success often relied upon a close sense of coordination with civic militia and archer units, or special elite mercenary men&mdash;at&mdash;arms who formed the base from which the attack sprang. When peasant levies were included in any army, they were placed where they could do the least harm to the enemy or their own allies.&#10;&#10;Woods, marshes, rivers, rocky terrain, or ocean fronts sometimes covered an army&rsquo;s flank as an anchor, but most battles took place in the open on a plain or in defense of a dominating height. Western armies rarely employed fancy turning maneuvers, and most battles between similar forces were resolved by direct brute force. Even so, the value of committing the last reserve for the ultimate decision was well appreciated. Islamic, Eurasian, and Byzantine armies, of course, applied much more sophisticated strategems, such as feigned retreats and sweeping double enfilades.&#10;&#10;"

Until he achieves this, he runs the risk of losing it to another player landing on the same square and playing a 'plunder' card. The game ends when all four treasures have been secured offshore and the player who has the most is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

To play, each player picks a WHO card, a WHAT card and a WHERE card and then begins drawing the ridiculous scene described on the cards (such as &quot;Prince Charles Performing Ballet In Egypt&quot;).&#10;&#10;Players then pass their creations onto everyone else who all try to guess what the artist drew.
