Each army consists of robot tanks, high-speed planes and robot battleships. Both players command such a complete army with each figure having its own peculiarities. By means of own insight and tactical play one can beat the opponent. As a player, you decide when the nuclear missiles should detonate, or how many planes should be on each aircraft carrier for the next air attack on the opponent's base. Submarines slip away from the grip of the heavy battleships and ravage the coast, while bombers inflict heavy casualties on the enemy behind his lines. METROPOLIS is an easy to learn game that you will not let go soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;The play board shows a map divided into a land area and a sea area. 10 squares wide and 15 squares long. There are 120 play figures, with different designs (laser tank, nuclear sub marine, repair vehicle, mine-field, ...).&#10;Each player tries to conquer two metropolises of his enemy.&#10;&#10;"

13456,,"From the publisher: &quot;Since time immemorial, the Kindred - vampires - have stalked unseen by the mortal masses upon whom they prey. Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city - one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;Prince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.&#10;&#10;Created in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

But getting the respect of the dwarves, who are small but proud, is not a simple matter. You need to be a good gold prospector but also an honoured beer brewer!&#10;&#10;After a preliminary placement phase during which the pieces are set up on the game board representing Skaaland (with its regions and villages), each player tries to win respect points.&#10;&#10;Each turn, each player may only carry out one of the six available actions. Players can bring new dwarves into the game, move those already on the board, prospect in search of gold, mine discovered gold, open a tavern or move a tavern.&#10;&#10;The problem with dwarves is that they're sometimes a little impetuous. For example, if a player discovers gold in a region, a rumour of its discovery immediately propagates across the land and the dwarves from the neighbouring regions arrive at top speed to see the new discovery. Not a moment's peace!&#10;&#10;Sometimes, while prospecting, a player runs into &quot;oops&quot; instead. That's annoying because the effort was wasted, and it means that there will never be any gold in that region.&#10;&#10;But gold isn't the only thing that matters in life! Digging is thirsty work and if a clan has a majority in a region, it may open a tavern. If the dwarves are too drunk to dig, then the clan that owns the tavern gains, each turn, respect points equal to the number of dwarves from opposing clans around the tavern. And that's good!&#10;&#10;The drunk dwarves either flee this village of debauchery, or return with their buddies and take over the den of iniquity.&#10;&#10;Contents: 1 rules insert, 1 game board, 90 dwarf figures, 12 tavern markers, 1 sack of 'gold', 1 sack of 'oops', 1 prospecting pawn, 1 special die.&#10;&#10;This game is the 3rd in the Tilsit Collection series.&#10;&#10;"
