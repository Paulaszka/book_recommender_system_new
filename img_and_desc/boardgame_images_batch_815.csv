Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot! Terrain rules allow to quickly create different planetary conditions.&#10;&#10;Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &ldquo;Ambush&rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Crew, your enemies will also become stronger.&#10;&#10;Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &ldquo;Enemy&rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.&#10;&#10;"

A Union victory here would send an unmistakable signal to the states in rebellion as well as the rest of the world that the Confederacy&rsquo;s cause was lost and further fighting a waste of lives and effort.&#10;&#10;A Confederate victory in the face of the tremendous Union host, that included every Union Ironclad on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, as well as some of the most seasoned regiments that numbered among them the first formations of all Black soldiers (free US citizens as well as former slaves), would signify the war would go on and that two nations, not one, could be the result of this &ldquo;second&rdquo; American Revolution.&#10;&#10;Players in A Gate of Hell: The Campaign for Charleston, July-September 1863 are cast in the roles of the historical commanders of the campaign; Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard for the Confederate defenders of Charleston, or Admiral Dahlgren and General Quincy Adams Gillmore of the Union. Can you do as well or better than they?&#10;&#10;A Gate of Hell uses an interactive design to portray this decisive battle of the American Civil War. Players use &ldquo;military support points&rdquo; (MSPs), representing the logistical and political support for the campaign, to mobilize and support their forces (ground and naval) on one of the most inhospitable battlegrounds of the war. Both sides have a variety of military assets to deploy, but the planning and effective use of MSPs throughout the game will determine in large measure who is the victor. Units represent mostly regiments for the ground units, and each ironclad for the naval units. All of the famous batteries and forts, including Sumter and Wagner, are portrayed.&#10;&#10;Rules cover Assault and Bombardment combats, multiple activations, the effects of battles elsewhere that can influence the actions at Charleston, the Union&rsquo;s &ldquo;Swamp Angel&rdquo;, as well as the early completions of the Confederate ironclad Charleston and submarine Hunley.&#10;&#10;Three scenarios are in included. One is on the April 1863 naval offensive by all of the Union ironclads that sought to defeat the rebels' fortresses and is an excellent single-turn introduction to the game&rsquo;s naval combat rules. A second is another single-turn scenario on the initial Union assault on Morris Island and Battery Wagner. These single-turn scenarios take under an hour to game, and are well-suited for tournament play. The third covers the entire campaign and that takes about 6 hours to complete.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Will the British be able to impose &quot;the King's Peace&quot; on the northern colonies or will the revolution survive to birth a new nation?&#10;&#10;The map and victory conditions for Almost a Miracle! show players why battles took place in key areas but also lets players explore those seemingly odd tertiary campaigns, like Halifax, Fort Pitt, and Quebec.&#10;&#10;Designer David Jones forces both sides to deal with their own challenges. The British consistently failed to &quot;live off the land&quot; and had to buy or ship food to sustain their armies, while the Continentals struggled with purchasing power and transportation.&#10;&#10;The game handles battles in both large and small scale, as both were critical to the War's outcome, with a system that models 18th Century combat and how it differed from later times, where morale, readiness, leadership, and mere chance all could be &quot;the&quot; critical factor at one time or another, and disease and desertion could be an army's biggest killer.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover the short enlistments of the Continentals, the uncertainty of French support and entry, prisoner exchanges, and the variable support of Loyalists and Native Americans. Both sides faced challenges they did not expect, and both sides contributed nearly as much to their own failures as they achieved in victory.

It is &quot;an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and verifiably and permanently&quot;. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.&#10;&#10;In BlockChain: The Dice Game, players will use cards to represent fundamental processes for calculating and validating a BlockChain block. Cards, for example, allow you to move dice from the stack (main dice queue) to its board; or increment or decrement one of the dice you are using. Each block has a value to be validated, where subsequent blocks have values &#226;&#128;&#139;related to the previous blocks.&#10;&#10;In some situations, players will use the cards to participate in the validation of a block made by another player. To do this, they needed to spend part of their tokens (representing the cost of processing that data) and became part of the validation pool of that block. One of the most common examples is the use of the PUSH card, where the player can &quot;push&quot; his dice to the board of another player.&#10;&#10;For each block validated, players are given tokens for validating the block or for having helped validate it. At the end of the fourth block validation, the player with the most tokens wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Will your team gather enough followers to seize power? And who is true to your cause when it looks lost?&#10;&#10;With the cards dealt at the beginning of the game, players are assigned to either the Rebel team or the Loyalist team. The two teams fight for control over locations that alter the rules in that particular fight, and provide influence to the winner.

Perhaps you secretly switched team yourself?&#10;&#10;The near endless combinations of locations and card distribution make for a vast number of unique situations and tactical challenges, ensuring no two games will ever feel the same.&#10;&#10;&#10;Game flow: &#10;At the beginning of each round, six locations are placed in the middle of the table and each player is dealt nine cards. If you were dealt a rebel card, you announce that you are on the rebel team; if you do not have a rebel card, you are on the loyalist team.&#10;&#10;The player who was dealt the &quot;rebel commander&quot; chooses a location for the first fight, and leads by playing the first card.&#10;&#10;The game then plays like a trick taking game, but with some important differences: certain cards will alter who wins the location (assassins take out the highest card, making the second highest card win instead), flags increases the value of the current location (play them when you think a team mate will win), and infiltrators make cards switch hands (for every infiltrator symbol played, the player who played the lowest card must draw one card from the hand of the winning player). With tactical card play you can both influence who wins the location and how much it is worth. But as cards switches hands, you may not be sure who is on which team.&#10;&#10;After all six locations have been won, players reveal which side they are on (if you have a rebel card, you are on the rebel team; if not, you are on the loyalist team).  Players now collect followers for their controlled influence, and all players on the team that controls the most influence are awarded bonus followers.

It was a place where, oddly enough, two armies confronted each other for FIVE days with almost no fighting, and Athenian democracy was put to the test as the Greek forces debated (and voted) whether or not to attack the Persians, finally reaching the affirmative only after seeing most of the Persian cavalry reloaded onto ships for use&hellip;somewhere probably unpleasant for Athens.&#10;&#10;&#10;As to the battle itself, numbers are uncertain but we know the Greeks were heavily outnumbered. We know also that the two armies&rsquo; fighting style and equipment were near opposites, with Greeks depending on shields, armor, and close-quarter fighting and Persians depending on missile weapons and skirmishing. It seems pretty clear that the Greek army ran (or advanced at speed) as soon as they got within bow range, to reduce the time they would endure arrows without being able to retaliate. And it seems pretty clear that, once the Greek army closed with the Persians (who had no room to withdraw and maintain a firing distance) that the battle would be a slaughter.

In a precarious position at home as well, he elected to move quickly, hoping for a powerful spoiling attack against the two closest armies that would rally some of his former allies and, even better, encourage the &ldquo;Seventh Coalition&rdquo; to negotiate.&#10;&#10;His movements with the Arm&eacute;e du Nord shocked both Wellington and Blucher and hinted at the old brilliance of mind.  But when it came to the battles&hellip; it seemed the imagination was no longer there. Ligny was a bludgeoning match, Quatre Bras a lost opportunity and bad staff work and communications caused failure at both.  Dispensing a third of his army to &ldquo;chase Bl&uuml;cher&rdquo; (without Grouchy managing to find him), he took the rest to deal with &ldquo;the Sepoy General&rdquo; that he at least pretended to disdain.  Wellington expected a flanking attack (and 25% of his troops missed the actual battle in preparation for it). What he got was &ldquo;a pounding match.&rdquo;  Though he had claimed his troops made up &ldquo;an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff,&rdquo; they bore the brunt of the best Napoleon could throw at them for 8 hours and turned the tide.&#10;&#10;And yet, it served as the completely final end to over 20 years of near-constant warfare, in one of the few periods in Western history defined by a single person&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;The Napoleonic Era.&rdquo;  And may be the most written-about battle in history.&#10;&#10;Designer Ed Wimble has focused solely on the 24 hours of June 18th, 1815.
