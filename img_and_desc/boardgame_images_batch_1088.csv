Your nest is drab and bare, sticks and leaves won't draw anyone's eye. Collect trinkets and tokens from the forest floor to increase the appeal of your nest. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better than that other guy's.&#10;&#10;Bower is a competitive 2 player, pick-up and deliver game with engine building upgrades and push-your-luck scoring elements. Gameplay revolves around strategic pathfinding and turn optimisation. On your turn, your opponent will first populate the forest with berries and trinkets using the seed deck. You may then alter the paths through the forest by rotating the 7 central tiles, before moving your Bowerbird along its current path, collecting the trinkets you pass over. If you can return your bowerbird to the nest, you score points depending on the number of trinkets it returned with. You also earn a powerful crest to enhance your future turns. The player with the most points from their bower and personal goal cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;Note: Great Bowerbirds (endemic to Australia) have a fascination with anything green or white. The Males will collect as many discarded toys, plastic scraps, stones, bones and shells as they can find to decorate their nest (Bower), in the hopes of scoring a partner during the November-January mating season. Young males will even work together on a &ldquo;practice&rdquo; nest, to ensure their skills are properly honed.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Chris Dias (Naramata, Ultramodern5) designed this cooperative tabletop game which allows two to four players to assume the roles of the characters from Brothers Bond and journey across a mystical land, partaking in numerous adventures in hopes of saving the world. Each game resides within a larger connected campaign where heroes travel across the land, engage in high-pitched action, and progress a story towards an epic climax. Along the way, characters develop and improve between sessions, carrying over skills and choices to later games.&#10;&#10;The story of Brothers Bond centers on Yoshi, the young, arrogant crown prince set to inherit an empire.&#10;&#10;After falling into trouble with his father, the one man he fears, Yoshi runs from home.  Picked up by two blind wandering samurai, Yoshi grows up to learn honor and strength.

While the Wehrmacht was defeated, the Nazi leadership has spent 1943 onwards building up a huge secret guerrilla force &ndash; Werwolf - to turn the occupation of Germany into a costly quagmire. Other groups, calling themselves the Edelweiss Movement, are opposed to the Nazis but also to the invaders and will fight to restore an independent and patriotic Germany. The Fuhrer himself has gone missing, and many Nazi officials are in hiding, perhaps awaiting their chance to return to power.&#10;Four factions are now competing for control and the loyalty of the German population: the Allied Occupation Forces (Western Allied Troops and German police, referred to as Allies in the rules) the Soviet Union (the Red Army and NKVD, referred to as Soviets in the rules), the Edelweiss Movement (patriotic but anti-Nazi German resistance, referred to as Edelweiss in the rules) and the Werwolf organisation (former SS and other Nazi fanatics trained in guerrilla warfare, referred to as Werwolf in the rules). The struggle will be not only for military control and the hearts and minds of the German people but also over the remnants of the Nazi war machine and research programs. The Soviets and Allies may reluctantly co-operate to crush German guerrillas but will compete to secure top German scientists and prototypes for their own arms race. As the Allies try to de-Nazify the populace and entice them with American pop culture, the Soviets will use everything from indoctrination to mass deportation to keep Germany under control. Loyalties will be split between democracy, communism and resurgent fascism or nationalism. This will not be an easy occupation&hellip;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
