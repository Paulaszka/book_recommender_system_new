A large branch (and some say the remains of a pulley) hung directly above the pit. He recruited friends and, armed with shovels, they began to dig. They found a solid floor of oak-logs every 10 feet for a considerable depth. Sea-water floodied the pit and prevented them from digging further. What still lies buried over 100 feet below the surface depends on who you ask: Captain Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, Incan gold, Shakespeare&rsquo;s lost manuscripts, the Holy Grail, or perhaps nothing at all.&#10;&#10;Over the years more men brought their ingenuity to bear on the problem, but failed. The failures were due to lack of modern machinery and ignorance; each excavation being stopped by water and lack of funds. A new century brings new technology and every hope that the mystery of Oak Island will soon finally be put to rest.&#10;&#10;Oak Island is a board game for 3-5 players attempting to get to the bottom of the mysterious treasure pit on Oak Island. The amateur treasure hunters bring their resources to bear on the problem of excavating the pit, and compete with each other to publish their findings and theories using an innovative scoring system.&#10;&#10;Players take turns picking up a row or column of resource cards from the card display. Action cards set in the display are triggered when a player picks it up. Machinery cards in the display do not refresh until the next round. A round ends when a player picks up the Treasure Trove License card, triggering an excavation.&#10;&#10;The Money Pit consists of consecutive tiles that are revealed as they are excavated jointly by the players. In order to excavate a tile, the symbols shown on it must be matched on resource cards invested secretly and simultaneously by the players. Each resource card has an abstract monetary value ($, $$, or $$$); the players are ranked in order of investment, with the one who invested least playing first in the next round. The player who invested most gets first pick of the assets (clues, machinery, and victory points) collected by the venture.&#10;&#10;Another source of VPs are the theories a player can publish. A theory consists of two or more clues joined together. A complete theory is any size rectangle (2xY) while a partial theory is any other assembly of clue pieces. Publishing a theory during the game consists of a player revealing one or more new clue pieces to form a new theory, or revealing one ore more new clue pieces and reinterpreting the clues of the same colour in an existing public theory (theirs or another players) in order to form a new theory. Clues that don&rsquo;t make it into the new theory cost the player points. The first clue played of any given colour are worth bonus points. Adjacent clues of the same colour within a theory are worth additional points. Complete theories earn a player 2 points per clue, excluding blank ones - incomplete ones earn a player 1 point per clue, including blank ones.&#10;&#10;"

On 24 July, Marshal Ney with the advance guard defeated General Craufurd under the walls of Almeida and threw him back across the Co&acirc; River, as a prelude to laying siege to the place. The French then penetrated into Portugal. Their advance was slow and difficult. As for Wellington, he drew up his army in the formidable position of Bussaco.

The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.&#10;&#10;Warcradle Studios will supply highly detailed, high-quality miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog-filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.&#10;&#10;Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall gameplay and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.&#10;&#10;We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.&#10;&#10;You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;"

Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors; or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players must take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. On their turn, players may choose to visit either the dungeon or the village. Plays can purchase other cards for their deck or level up their heroes in the village. If they instead go to the dungeon, they play their heroes, weapons, items, and spells to defeat any one of the available monsters. The deeper the monster is in the dungeon, the more light is needed or the monster will gain power. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;From the publisher:&#10;&#10;Thunderstone returns with Dragonspire! Featuring all-new art for every card (even Militia and Daggers), experience point tokens (not cards!), and the all new &quot;Setting&quot; cards which alter the game on a global scale.  Dragonspire includes 18 new village cards, 11 new heroes, and 8 new monster sets.&#10;&#10;With enough cards to play the game right out of the box, this is a great Thunderstone edition for those just getting into the game.&#10;&#10;Dragonspire also has a new storage box format, plastic XP tokens, and a brand new Dungeon board to help players keep up with light and darkness.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone: Dragonspire is not a an expansion, but is instead a separate stand-alone game that may be played along with components of Thunderstone.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The Dragon-Humanoid divider included with the game is meant for a future expansion as a promo.&#10;&#10;"

If you do roll a 4, roll the dice again; if you once again roll a 4, you must return one of your caterpillars on the board to the starting space; if you roll anything else, then you can move a caterpillar from the starting space to the core, then an additional 1-3 spaces depending on what you rolled.&#10;&#10;If you manage to fill all three spaces on one half of a line with your pieces, you immediately move all three pieces to the goal.&#10;&#10;"

Use actions to gather resources and knights to protect your realm, while avoiding the watchful eyes of the king and pope. Make your barony worthy of establishing the realm&rsquo;s first cathedral!&#10;&#10;Barons is a card game which uses four different decks representing different types of land: mines, rivers, forests and pastures. Each deck contains cards representing actions, buildings (including 5 church/cathedral cards), and 9 knights.&#10;&#10;The cards have three functions: they can either be used face up as an action, knight or building; face down as land or discarded as money to pay for other cards.&#10;&#10;Each player starts the game with a castle card surrounded by one land card of each type. On your turn, you play cards to build your barony and acquire resources, by going through three phases in order.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Play action and knight cards and use building abilities.&#10;     Add one land or one building to your barony.&#10;     Tax up to four adjacent lands in your barony to draw cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;To win, you must first build a Church and then a Cathedral in your barony. The game ends immediately when someone builds a Cathedral.&#10;&#10;"

The words are critiqued, with the fewest critiques going to the most prestigious word. After ten rounds, the player with the fewest critiques wins.&#10;&#10;If you can't make a long word, you can instead try to make one that ends in a string of cards of the same suit (a &quot;meld&quot;).  Because the game combines word-forming skills with other pattern formation, a player's obscure vocabulary will help but not guarantee a win against players with more conventional vocabularies (but an eye for long melds).&#10;&#10;"
