The players goal is to visit / collect a pre-determined number of islands from a scorecard of 160 Caribbean Island destinations.&#10;&#10;Islands are added or subtracted to individual scores by landing on island squares on the gameboard or by landing on the Island Card or Ship Cards squares on the gameboard, and taking the top card from the appropriate deck. These Island and Ship cards (approximately 400 total) reveal information about the islands and their people, cultures, foods, carnivals, languages, art and design, beaches, scuba dives, tropical rainforests, exotic animals, multicoloured fish and corals and much more.&#10;&#10;The Cards also feature information about the Cruise Experience - shipboard activities, shoreside excursions and the wonder of awaking to a new destination aboard your floating luxury hotel with it's multi-national staff and crew.&#10;&#10;Designer Notes&#10;&#10;In designing this game, I have gone against the grain in accepted board game strategies where the norm is to win at any cost; destroying, trivializing or bankrupting other players along the way to a so called victory. The main theme of this game is of the Journey ~ not the finish, and it is hoped that in playing this game people will be encouraged to take a real journey, maybe to the beautiful islands and waters of the Caribbean or maybe further afield where they can interact with others, break down barriers and fears, find new life-paths and celebrate the world in a more spititual and humanitarian light.&#10;&#10;The Game is packaged in a clear polycarbonate Captain's Chart Tube ( a virtually unbreakable and watertight container, adding to the nautical theme ). To repackage Game ~  roll up all game contents in the laminated gameboard and slide game back into chart tube. Gameboard may also be left out of tube and bluetacked to wall as a poster between uses.&#10;&#10;"

Basically a two-player game where one person controls the French and the other, the Germans (a third player can be brought in to control British forces).&#10;&#10;The game is open-ended... it continues until one side of the conflict has achieved its victory conditions or a stalemate is reached.  To win as the German player you must capture Paris and cut it off from supply for two complete turns.  The French must capture two German supply centres to win.  Either player may declare a Stalemate if the game lasts longer than 12 turns... a 'marginal' victory may then be calculated based on city control and strength losses.&#10;&#10;"

Tiles are played on the intersections and remain where they are played unless captured.  Pawns are played inside the triangles and move from space to space.  The object of the game is to complete scores, traps and captures; once one of those is accomplished, a new round is played.  The first person to accomplish one of each is the winner; once you've accomplished one, you are not allowed to repeat that.&#10;&#10;A score is accomplished by moving a pawn from your goal to the opponent's goal.  A trap is accomplished by trapping an opponent's pawn so that it cannot move.  A capture is accomplished by capturing ten of your opponent's tiles.&#10;&#10;"
