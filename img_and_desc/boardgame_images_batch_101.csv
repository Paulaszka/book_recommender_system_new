What began as an extension of the Russian Civil War in 1919 became a full scale conflict between two modem nations. Poland, free once again, defends its independence by striking deep into the heart of its old nemesis, Russia. The Red Army, still deeply involved in its Civil War, drives to reconquer the Tsar's old possessions and push the Red Banner of Communism into Western Europe. The tactics and weapons of this war formed a strange blend of old and new. For the last time, a great European battle could end with the sound of trumpets and a charge of horsemen. Yet the tank, the airplane, the machinegun and the railroad all played their role as well.&#10;&#10;The Russo-Polish war provided both a final glimpse of the 19th century and an early look at the strategies of World War Two. This game simulates the Russo-Polish war of 1920 at the operational/strategic level. It uses simple rules, with numerous options for greater realism and/or play balance.&#10;&#10;Published in Strategy and Tactics magazine issue #156&#10;&#10;"

To start the game, you assemble the frame pieces, which create a space large enough to hold 20 tiles. Players alternate placing tiles in the frame - each player places the tiles with his opponent's color on them. When finished there will be two empty spaces in the maze. Put an energy token on a every circle of its color, and each player starts with one energy token in their reserve. Trovers and guards are placed in opposite corners and the movement part of the game begins.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you move all your pieces. Guards can move up to five spaces orthogonally, while trovers can move like guards but also diagonally.&#10;&#10;Trovers are the only pieces that can pick up energy tokens - you can only collect your own color. Guards simply block your opponent's trover, though if he pays one energy token he can move by a guard. The tiles create a two-level maze, with ramps printed on the tiles to change between levels, and walls occasionally to force movement around them. You can pay one energy token to have your trover jump down from the upper level to an adjacent lower level space.&#10;&#10;If you spend an energy token, you can &quot;morph&quot; the maze: move a tile to an adjacent empty space. You may do this as much as you like and can afford during a turn.

When you have five of the latter you have to get your van to an airport space, and you then fly your plane along the air routes in the middle of the board, trying to get to your five destination airports.&#10;&#10;You can in theory go back to the airport where you left your van and start moving that again - the reason to do this would be to try to pick up Dispatch cards that set your clock back.
