When in defense, a piece can only be captured by a larger piece.  When pointing, a piece may be captured by any other piece.&#10;&#10;Captured pieces are worth different points depending on their size: 1 for small, 2 for medium, 3 for large.  The player who captures a number of enemy Pikemen worth a given amount first wins-- usually 12 points.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;    Super Duper Games&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by Star Fleet Scramble&#10;&#10;"

Each player assumes command of an Allied or Axis platoon or company. &#10;PANZER WAR includes rules covering most weapons, troops and vehicles used during the period 1942 to 1945. Battle action is simulated in a detailed and realistic manner, but with an extraordinary ease of play once the basic rules are understood. Many things that will seem difficult in reading will become almost second nature after just a few games. Once the basics of play have been mastered players will want to include some of the more interesting and complex optional rules dealing with artillery and aircraft.&#10;&#10;(from the rules booklet)&#10;&#10;&#10;Typical 1970-1980's game style with charts to depict the warfare of 1/285 scale armor vehicles on all fronts of World War II. Key application of these rules is the modular movement to simulate both player moving at the same time in leiu of ugoigo systems that prevailed at the time. Sandwiched between the infantry movement was 4 separate movement phases with six different firing phases taking place after movement. Very chart driven.PANZER WAR was designed for 1/285th miniatures in mind, but can be adjusted for other scales.&#10;Game Scale for 1/285th is 1mm = 2 meters.&#10;Each vehicle or piece of equipment represents one such unit.&#10;Each miniature soldier figure represents 3 actual men.&#10;Each turn represents from one to three minutes.&#10;&#10;The First Edition was published in 1979; the production run of 250 units was sold out.&#10;&#10;The Second Edition was produced in full color in 1981. A print run of about 1000 units was produced. This version came with:&#10;1x Rules Booklet.&#10;1x Chart Folder with common used tables printed in the two inside pages and back page.&#10;1x Sheet of Aspect Diagrams (Three diagrams).&#10;11x Vehicle Battle Charts.&#10; - 3x German&#10; - 2x British&#10; - 2x American&#10; - 1x French&#10; - 1x Italian&#10; - 2x Russian&#10;&#10;&#10;The Third Edition of the game is distributed for free on the author's website.&#10;The rules were later used as the basis for the Panzer Command PC game by Matrix Games."

The deck has 78 letter cards -- the entire alphabet in each color (red, green, &amp; blue).  Each letter has a point value from 1 to 5, commoner letters with higher values.  Deal 7 cards each for 6 or less players, 6 each for 7 players, 5 for 8 players, and turn up the top of the draw pile to start the discard pile.&#10;&#10;In a turn of the Standard game, a player draws 1 from either pile, plays words to the table, and discards 1.  Each word must have at least 2 letters, and all must be of the same color, unless it has more than 1 of a certain letter.  If the word has more than one repeated letter (e.g. &quot;refer&quot;) the second 'e' and 'r' most both be of the same color.  Words on the table may not be added to or otherwise changed.&#10;&#10;The hand ends when a player empties his hand, or when the draw pile runs out.  Each player scores: for words on the table, the length of the word squared (e.g. 5 letters =&gt; 25 points); for words in the hand, the simple length of the word (5 letters =&gt; 5 points); and for each card in hand, the value of the card is subtracted.  The game is won at 150 points.&#10;&#10;The Advanced game has a yahtzee-like scoring pad.  There is a row for each word length from 2 to 8, and two scoring columns.  The first word scored for each length is written in the Primary column; and further words for that length are simply tallied in the Secondary column.  After a chosen length of time or number of hands, the player with the highest Primary total wins; ties are broken by the Secondary total.&#10;&#10;Finally, the Inverse game only scores penalties: at the end of the hand, players total the points left in their hands.  After a chosen number of deals, the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;"
