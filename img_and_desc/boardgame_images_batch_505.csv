In the video game, fruit (and bombs) are tossed into the air and the player makes gestures to slice as much fruit with their sword as possible while avoiding bombs.&#10;The Fruit Ninja Card Game is a very simple push your luck card game that makes thematic use of simply cutting the deck of cards.  By cutting the deck and selecting cards based on the risk associated with the color coded card backs, players attempt to be the first to either collect one of each of the 7 types of fruit or collect 25 pieces of the same type of fruit.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;After shuffling the deck of cards, the starting player cuts the deck while making the sound of someone making a sword chop.  That player chooses either the top card from the bottom section of the deck or the bottom card from the top section of the deck (a choice between the two inner cards of the split deck). By looking at the color of the card backs, the player can asses the risk of choosing a particular card.  Some cards have a higher risk of being a bomb while having the potential to contain more pieces of fruit.  The player continues their turn as long as they avoid choosing a bomb card.  As long as the player only finds fruit cards, they continue adding up fruit and splitting the top section of the deck remaining from their previous split.  If the player chooses to stop, they get to keep their fruit cards and pass the deck to the next player.  If at some point the player chooses to cut the deck and chooses a bomb card, they end their turn and loose any fruit that they have revealed during that turn (while keeping fruit earned on previous turns).  Three types of power bananas can be played from a players saved stash of fruit to perform one of the following actions based on the type of fruit: steal a fruit, ignore a bomb or take an additional turn.  While very simple, this card game remains thematically true to the simple video game that it is based on.&#10;&#10;CONTENTS:&#10;103 Fruit Ninja Cards + 1 sheet of rules in English&#10;&#10;FROM THE BOX:&#10;Based on the hit game.  Make Sensei proud!  Cut the deck--select the top or the bottom.  The first player to collect one of each fruit or 25 of any fruit wins!  The colors on the card backs will help you choose.  Be wary! Bombs end your turn and you forfeit this turns bounty.  Power bananas grant special ninja powers.&#10;&#10;"

It has been released on the magazine Modern War. It examines an Iranian strategic alternative that&rsquo;s becoming increasingly plausible in light of the draw down of US military strength in the Middle East. That is, just as it did in Cold War Europe, the prospect of both sides having nuclear weapons in this &ldquo;zone of confrontation&rdquo; may work to create a deterrent umbrella that, at least for some time, could allow for a potentially decisive conventional war to go on underneath the threat of &ldquo;mutually assured destruction.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Oil War: Iran Strikes (OW) is a low-intermediate complexity design set in a timeframe of the near future &ndash; 2013 through 2017 &ndash; in which the Iranians may indeed have developed some kind of nuclear capability. At that same time, with the &ldquo;War on Terror&rdquo; having likely slithered to an indecisive end by then, and the US therefore likely fallen back into another post-Vietnam-type &ldquo;neo-isolationist&rdquo; phase, the possibility for a blitz-style Iranian conventional military victory &ndash; aimed at establishing and certifying Tehran as the hegemon of the Gulf region &ndash; moves to the fore.&#10;           &#10;OW examines the strategic and operational possibilities and parameters inherent in the opening Iranian offensive of such a war. There are no rules for the use of atomic bombs or other weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The situation is on such a hair trigger in regard to that aspect of things, if one such weapon were to go off, many more detonations would be certain to follow. The idea is for Iran to gain a victory without resorting to &ldquo;game changing&rdquo; WMD.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map equals 18 miles (30 km) from side to opposite side, and its coverage stretches from Turkey in the north to the UAE in the south, and from the Iranian border and Persian Gulf on the east to Baghdad and Riyadh on the west. Each game turn represents three days, with a full match covering the first month of the war.&#10;Units of maneuver are corps, divisions, brigades, and US brigade combat teams (BCT) of various kinds, each containing from about 5,000 to 15,000 men and/or 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles or helicopters. The most up-to-date data available have been used to establish each participant country&rsquo;s detailed order or battle, including the Iranian regular army (Artesh), Basij (martyr force) and Revolutionary Guards, along with the ground forces of Iraq (loyalist and insurgent militias and regulars, Kurds, and the &ldquo;elite&rdquo; Quick Reaction Force). There are also the armies of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Syria, Turkey and, of course, the US.&#10;&#10;Special rules cover such things as: sudden death victories and victories on points, variable phase sequences, US naval supremacy, unique Saudi combat5 characteristics, geographic and multi-national movement and combat restrictions, US locking zones of control, US bases, Kuwaiti border defenses, Iraqi unit defections, Al Qods terror attacks, massed Basij suicide attacks, Basra&rsquo;s critical logistical status, Iranian airborne and marine units, artillery, combat engineers, airpower, UN intervention, unique US BCT capabilities, the legend of the 12th Imam, and much more.&#10;&#10;"

One commands the Sinai Front; the second commands the Eastern Front. Each player also commands the Arab forces facing the other player (his opponent.) The game is designed in this manner owing to the massive qualitative superiority of Israeli forces in this war. The assumption of the game is that an Israeli victory was generally inevitable, so the intent is to place the players in a situation in which they have to compete with each other on both sides to win the greatest possible victory on their own Front.&#10; The map is divided into two sectors, one for each Front. Only units of that Front may operate in that sector. There are additional units, called Reserves, which can possibly be assigned to either Front. The objective of each player is to score the most Victory Points in terms of seizing objectives and destroying enemy units at the lowest possible cost. Meanwhile, the player will be using the Arab forces facing the other player to delay or even stop that Front.&#10; The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) of Israel and the surrounding regions from the Golan Heights to the Suez canal (and all of the Sinai), and one counter-sheet (228 counters) representing all of the Israeli and Arab forces, color-coded to apportion them by their respect Front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Published with Modern War #4&#10;&#10;"

Historically, the quick US-Coalition victory over Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s military forces in March of that year quickly degenerated into an insurgency that swept the country. The situation was eventually turned around, but only after a steep learning curve for the United States and its partners. The game shows some of the major factors involved. &#10; There are two players in the game: The Insurgents (who want to seize control of Iraq. These represent various Iraqi Rebels and Foreign Fighters, the latter including Al Qaeda and Iranian support, among others), and the Counterinsurgents (who want to restore stability to a democratic Iraq, as well as defeat any Al Qaeda elements which may be operating in the country.) These represent Multinational (MNF) forces (US and allies) and Iraqi Government Forces (which also include friendly Iraqi tribal militias).&#10; Both players have a set of pieces that represent conventional and unconventional forces. During their respective turns, players move their pieces amongst the spaces on the map, and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces. The objective for each player is to establish control over Iraq.&#10; One unique feature of the game is that units&rsquo;, as they engage in combat, effectiveness may increase or decrease as they gain experience in fighting, or become demoralized.&#10; The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 228 counters.&#10;&#10;"

Thereafter, each player, in turn, places one tile from his hand onto the table, face-up and oriented horizontally from his point of view, such that at least one segment of the played tile matches at least one tile segment that is already part of the tableau. The tableau usually takes on an irregular, blob-like shape and need not remain closepacked; unusual shapes and enclosed empty spaces of any size are both acceptable. Not all segments need to match, but the more that do, the more points the play is worth. One matched segment (the most common play) scores nothing. Two matched segments score one point for the partnership that played it. Three matched segments score five points. Four or more matched segments score ten points. Points are recorded as they are made during play.&#10;&#10;(from the rules found on pagat.com)&#10;&#10;"

A world ruled by the ruthless battle mage by the name of the Kaiser. The planet of Titan is at war. The Kaiser is bringing the world to its knees. This is a war where anything is possible and anyone can become a legend. It is here where your journey begins.&#10;&#10;Will you join the Kaiser and his allies in the total domination of the planet or will you be part of the opposition? You get to decide how this story will tell itself. Make sure to choose wisely, for the fate of the planet lies within your hands.&#10;&#10;Make your choice!&#10;&#10;Dark Legacy is a unique strategy game that mixes the best elements of Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons and Chess and wraps them all up into a in-depth sci-fi/fantasy story. In Dark Legacy, players are no longer bystanders of the battle,  they get to be part of it as a war general within one of six different factions. With the unique and various weapons, armor and relics, that a player can equip themselves with, players can become whomever they imagine themselves to be.&#10;&#10;In Dark Legacy, it is the players objective to destroy their opponents and their armies, by building a deck of magic spells that no one can withstand, rolling the d20 in their favor and strategically summoning their army to be the strongest. Just like in real battle you will have to anticipate the probability of the unexpected. Don't make choices too hastily for they may be the demise of your army and yourself.&#10;&#10;Dark Legacy is a game that can be played one-on-one or in team battle.&#10;&#10;Here are the type of cards that can be played in Dark Legacy:&#10;&#10;     Enhancement cards are for summoned creatures, weapons and the Hero. These cards can either strengthen or weaken that which it is place upon.&#10;     Creature cards are just that. They are the faction specific cards that each one of the six different factions use to strengthen their army to win the battle.&#10;     Magic cards are the spell cards used to tip the balance in battle. There are faction specific magic cards and general magic cards.&#10;     Armor cards are only for the Heroes in battle. This gives each Hero extra defense points on top of their life points.&#10;     Weapon cards are only for the Heroes in battle. There is a wide variety of weapon cards and as the Hero levels up there are stronger and more magical weapons that become available to them.&#10;     Relic cards are ancient cards with abilities that are available to every player if you find them. There are relics that will fit every players style of fighting.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Evolution System for Battle&#10;&#10;     Before the battle begins, players must decide who is going first.&#10;     At the beginning of every battle each player draws five cards.&#10;     Each player is now allowed to place one card on the equip side of the mat. This card has to cost 0 and the player has to have the correct skill level to put that card down.&#10;     There is no damage permitted for the first round in battle, meaning that no one can attack or cast spells that deal damage until it is the first person&rsquo;s turn again.&#10;     The player that is going first must begin the battle by drawing a card. (At the beginning of every turn players will draw a card.)&#10;     In order to cast any of the player&rsquo;s cards they must roll the d20. There is only one roll per turn, unless there is a card in play that allows for another roll. The number that you roll will be the&#10;&#10;&#10;number of casting points you have to cast cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;     In order to cast spells you have to have a high enough SKILL LEVEL (SL) and have enough CASTING POINTS (CP).&#10;     The player can then cast any number of cards as long as they have the proper SL and CP.&#10;     If the opponent has the ability to counter the spell they can do so after the card is cast.&#10;&#10;&#10;Now the second round begins.  At the beginning of the player&rsquo;s turn they must draw a card and then decide weather to attack or cast and use the cards abilities to help you win the battle.&#10;&#10;Charging Field&#10;&#10;     Players may put any card, within their faction or subsection, on this field face down. This card is now charging. This field is to be used for cards that are above of your skill level. &#10;     You may place cards that are in your skill range, but that would defeat the purpose of charging the card. In order to cast the card that you put on the charging field, it must charge for the difference of your skill level and the skill level required to cast&#10;&#10;&#10;"

This is done by landing on a space next to a building and rolling the die to determine whether they get two stacks of money, set off the alarm allowing the police to deploy the helicopter to protect a building of their choice, or set off the alarm but still get away with one stack of money. The police win if they arrest all four thieves before they manage to get ten stacks of money. Capturing thieves involves landing on the same space as a thief.&#10;&#10;"

Each of the cards contain two or three questions. To win a card, a player has to answer all the questions (except for the &quot;guesstimation&quot; one) on a card.&#10;&#10;The cards are shuffled and two cards are placed, face up, on the table. The front side shows the card's category and what types of questions it contains. Questions come in different levels of difficulty, and there are yes/no questions and &quot;guesstimation&quot; questions where a number has to be guessed. The active player chooses one of the two cards. If they can answer all the questions on it, they win the card, if not, the card is removed from the game. Then the pool is filled up so that there are two cards again, and it's the next player's turn.&#10;&#10;A player can have more than one card from the same category. These extra cards can be used to avoid having to answer one particular question, or three from the same category can be exchanged for one from a different category.&#10;&#10;For questions marked as difficult, the active player can ask the questioner for a possible answer (which the questioner has to make up), turning it into a yes/no question. Not doing so, however, has an advantage as well: If a player can answer a difficult question without help, they earn an additional turn.&#10;&#10;Special rule for the &quot;guesstimation&quot; questions (only when three or more are playing): Instead of trying for a new card from the pool, the active player can decide to &quot;attack&quot; a player of his/her choice. The next player not involved in the attack reads the guesstimation question from the top card of the card stack. The attacked player has to state a number, then the attacker states his/her estimation. The player whose guess is closest to the correct answer may steal a card of his/her choice from the other player; that card now counts as one of their own.&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as one player has won one card from each of the five categories.&#10;&#10;"

The goal is to win 270 electoral votes before your opponent so that you can send your candidate to the White House.  You do this by answering question about all things concerning the United States.  The game board features a map of the United States with the American flag superimposed over it and shows the states' boundaries.  Let's say that you grabbed a Georgia card.  You would place your token, either Daniel David Donkey- Democrat, or Edward Elephant-Republican, on Georgia and answer the question.  If you are correct, you win the electoral votes for Georgia.  Then, you would place a Georgia-shaped piece that is either red(Republican) or blue(Democrat) on Georgia to show that you won Georgia's electoral votes.  Your opponent would take a turn and you continue this until one of you reaches 270 electoral votes.  The questions range from American history to pop culture.  It's a fast-paced American trivia game.&#10;&#10;"

In this game a roll of a D6 is referenced to a chart to determine the movement of each horse.  Each horse has a separate card with its movement chart thereon. The charts have three rows of numbers, each for a different section of the track. Turn order is by lane in the first round and then till the finish, turn order is by leader. Lane changes are permitted only as the very first move of a pawn (horse) on its turn.  The first lane change is allowed as a forward diagonal movement of the pawn.  Additional lane changes in a turn are at a cost of one movement point each,  So, if you have five movement points and make two lane changes as the first two movements of your pawn then you can move four spaces forward along the track. There are areas on the track where lane changes are prohibited.  &#10;   A bit of statistical analysis was made by Cincinnati native Howard Hughes in creating the horse cards.  The horse cards reflect the performance of real horses in that those that excel in sprints fair poorly in long distance races and vice versa.  There is no provision for betting in this game.  The components are somewhat primitive, consisting of; horse movement cards, pawns and coin money all punched from a perforated sheet of card stock.  The box art has a beautiful charcoal drawing of a jockey on his horse making their way to the starting gate.&#10;&#10;"
