Most cards have a strength value (0-7), and the card with the lower strength value is discarded, with the opponent's other cards in the same column then sliding forward.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot use all of their actions or has no actions (due to having no cards on the battlefield) or loses control of Odin's Crown/Ring, then they lose the game.&#10;&#10;"

Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play.

Here, fighting began to settle down in early fall 1941 and by January had become static. Then the Soviets attacked. By late January the Soviet 11th Army had broken the German front in several sectors and threatened to surround perhaps 70,000 Germans around Demyansk.

They try to infiltrate a village and control it from inside.&#10;&#10;There are six villagers in the village. You send your henchman werewolves into these villagers to control them. You gain victory points by controlling these villagers, and the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;A game consists of seven rounds. Do the following each round:&#10;1) Players play an initiative card simultaneously. The player with highest initiative value goes first. But if there's a tie for the initiative value, all tied players lose the opportunity to play this round. (In Japan, the mechanism that has the same cards or the tied values cancelling each other out is called &quot;butting&quot;.)&#10;2) Among non-tied players, in the initiative order, place your henchman on a villager. You may then activate that villager's special ability.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, for each villager, total your henchmen's influence points on that villager. You gain that villager's victory points if you have the highest influence points on that villager. But &quot;butting&quot; is applied here again; you cannot gain victory points if your influence points are tied with any other's.&#10;&#10;Although this game is inspired by Werewolf, it is not a werewolf game. You send your henchmen in like worker placement, and determine the controller of each villager by majority of influence. And the &quot;butting&quot; and a little bit of bluffing are the keys to enjoying the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#178;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#157;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#157;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;6&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#229;&#140;&#186;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#139;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#156;&#176;&#229;&#140;&#186;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#230;&#148;&#175;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#230;&#174;&#138;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#230;&#157;&#145;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#135;&#229;&#139;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#232;&#131;&#189;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

These collectors arranged a meeting to exchange dolls and try to reassemble the rare Matryoshkas. Obviously each collector wants to leave this meeting with the most valuable collection. But who will succeed?&#10;&#10;Matryoshka is played in four rounds. In each round, each player shows a Matryoshka from his hand and all other players make a hidden trade offer. After checking all offers, the player trades his card with another player.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players must show a part of their collection by placing Matroyshkas on front of them. That way other players know what they're looking for. The player with the most valuable collection at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

As soon as everyone's done this, all players race simultaneously to place pipes in their game board to create connections between matching tokens. Players grab numbered spanner cards in the order that they finish, and whoever grabs the &quot;1&quot; spanner gets first choice of a scoring card. Incorrect tile layouts net someone the &quot;4&quot; spanner.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, whoever has the most medals wins!&#10;&#10;"
