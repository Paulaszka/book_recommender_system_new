It uses a standard deck and has four subgames (Queen of Spades, Last 2, Tricks and FanTan).&#10;&#10;Queen of Spades: the object is to avoid taking the Queen of Spades.  Players who win a trick on which the QoS is played pays the bank $100.&#10;&#10;Last 2:  Avoid winning the next-to-last and the last tricks.  The player who takes next-to-last trick pays $50 to bank; Player who takes the last trick pays $100 to bank.&#10;&#10;Tricks: The banker gives the appropriately marked chip to the winner of each trick. At the completion of play, each player adds the numbers on his chips and multiplies this total by $10. This dollar amount is what the player receives from the bank. For example, if a player wins the 1st, 4th, and 11th tricks, then he would receive $160 from the bank (1+4+11 = 16 x $10 = $160). The 1st trick is worth $10; $20 for 2nd; $30 for 3rd; etc.&#10;&#10;FanTan: Play all of one's cards before any other player can play all of his.  The bank pays $100 to the player which is the 1st Out; Bank pays $50 to 2nd Out; 3rd Out receives nothing and pays nothing; 4th Out pays $50 to bank; 5th Out pays $75 to bank; 6th Out pays $100 to bank; 7th Out pays $125 to bank; 8th Out pays $150 to bank.&#10;&#10;"

Then players take their turns moving the silver stone in an adjacent not-empty hole and capturing the stones which is contained in that hole. White stones are worth 10 points each. Red, blue, yellow and green stones are worth the square of their number (e.g.: if you capture 3 red stones, you get 9 points; if you capture 5 green stones, you get 25 points, and so on&hellip;).&#10;Play continues until the silver stone is isolated (e.g.: it is surrounded only by empty holes).&#10;&#10;In a game with 3 or more players, the final score of every player is given by the sum of the stones he/she captured, PLUS the sum of the stones captured by the following player.

Because of its simplicity and interaction,  it can be played by nearly anyone, anywhere.  Depending on the type of game you play, it can last from a single, 20-minute game to a 12 round game lasting hours.&#10;&#10;Although Mexican Train can be played with a standard set of Dominos, branded versions usually include a range of parts to facilitate play and highlight the theme, such as a train station, train pieces to mark players' trains and the &quot;Mexican train&quot;, and a &quot;woo woo!&quot; train whistle.  It is typically played with a set of double 12 dominoes (although double 6 and double 9 sets can be used with fewer players), and there are a variety of sets packaged by various manufactures as &quot;Mexican Train Dominoes&quot; that include all the necessary components to play.&#10;&#10;A double-twelve domino set has 91 tiles. The goal is for the players to get rid of their dominoes. Starting with the highest double tile placed in the middle of the table, which is the station, each player creates a line of dominoes. This is their train. Another train, the &quot;Mexican Train,&quot; can be played on by anyone. In the event that a player cannot play at all, even after drawing a new tile, she must place a marker (often little colored plastic trains that come with the game) on their train which allows others to play on her train temporarily until the marker is removed.&#10;&#10;As soon as one player is out of dominoes, the other players add up the value of their remaining tiles. At the end of the evening, the player with the lowest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)&#10;&#10;Klabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of &quot;Schmeiss&quot; which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)&#10;&#10;After bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.&#10;&#10;Non-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce &quot;Bella&quot; on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.&#10;&#10;After the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:&#10;&#10;Jass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points&#10;Menel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.&#10;Any Ace 11 points&#10;Any 10 10 points.&#10;Any King 4 points.&#10;Any Queen 3 points.&#10;Any Jack 2 points.&#10;Last Trick 10 points.&#10;&#10;If the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or &quot;Sink&quot; points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.&#10;&#10;Prior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.&#10;&#10;Klabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules. It is very popular in New England and especially Hartford, Connecticut.&#10;&#10;"

Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.&#10;&#10;A 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a &quot;Piquet Deck&quot;). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the &quot;Cents&quot; version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.&#10;&#10;Play consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play.  Winning requires skill at all three.&#10;&#10;In the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game.  The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces.  The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump.  Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.&#10;&#10;The small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game.  Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.&#10;&#10;"

In addition there are seven yellow pieces representing treasure to be captured.&#10;&#10;The board is a hexagon of hexagons (think Settlers, but it's not geomorphic).  Each edge of the entire hexagon is made up of six smaller hexagons.  These are in three colors: red, blue, and yellow, such that no two hexes of the same color border each other.  Two of the corners have castles printed in them.&#10;&#10;Players take turns moving one piece at a time.  Each of the pieces moves and captures differently.  Basic chess-like rules apply: one piece per space, you can't move through a piece (though there are some knight-like pieces that can jump), land on a piece to capture it, promotion of the lesser pieces if the reach the opposite side, etc.&#10;&#10;There are five different victory conditions given in the rules.  Players must decide on victory conditions before beginning the game.  They can be combined, such as &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (capture the opponent's sorcerer) and &quot;Castle Occupation&quot; (just what you think it means).  The treasure pieces aren't used unless one or both of the treasure victory conditions are in play.&#10;&#10;That's basically it.  The pieces are rather bland, but the board is a must for abstract game designers who think in primary colors ...&#10;&#10;"

(Source: The Game Makers: the Story of Parker Brothers by Philip Orbanes)&#10;&#10;The board is a stylized map illustrating activities which an American Tourist might engage in as they travel around Europe. The players start in the houses at the top left of the board, each with two tokens, and using a &quot;spinner&quot; or one or two dice, travel through the &quot;shopping district&quot;, making purchases for their trip. Exiting the &quot;shopping district&quot;, they take a cab to the Depot, and begin their trip on the railroad to the city. Some spaces have red dots, and include instructions that the players must follow, such as taking alternative routes (which can be shorter or longer than the main path), or moving to other red dots on the board, either forward or backward. Midway on the track (at the center of the board) is the &quot;Centerville Depot&quot; which a player must enter, and spend more for a meal. The end of the game has several water routes branching off from the railroad, which must be taken if they are landed on. If a player lands on another player on the railroad or a water route, the player landed on is sent back to the Depot.&#10;&#10;Players have two tokens, and a choice about which to move, which affects how much debt they incur, and whether they get stuck into bad situations.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the first one to reach the end with both tokens, unless the second player reaches the end with both tokens, having spent less than half as much as the first player.&#10;&#10;"

These include German, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian, Spanish and Romanian units. German tank units provide the real striking power for the Axis, and these are the strongest units in the game. The German infantry is also numerous and strong. The other Axis units are not usually as powerful as the German ones, though the Hungarian unit is good and there is a Romanian cavalry corps.&#10;&#10;Soviet units are generally armies. Some of these are able to stand up to the Germans, but most cannot; while the Soviets start out with a very powerful army the first Axis turn is rough on the Red Army.  The Soviet player must place his or her forces carefully and choose the time and place for counter-attacks. The Soviet player does have the aid of fleets in both the Baltic and the Black Seas, allowing landings behind enemy lines and sometimes support in combat. The Red Army of Workers and Peasants has many tank units, but they are not as strong as the German panzers. It can counter with paratroopers and shock troops, special units not available to the Axis.&#10;&#10;The original game was published in 2004.  The 2016, Avalanche Press released an updated &quot;Player's Edition&quot;, more pieces, a larger map and more scenarios.
