13092,,"In the future, internet technology has advanced to usher in the Network Age. Everyone has a portable communications interface device called a &ldquo;PET&rdquo; or personal terminal that contains an artificial intelligence program, or &ldquo;NetNavi,&rdquo; to navigate the worldwide information network. MegaMan, a NetNavi and his human operator, Lan work together along with their friends to combat viruses bent on unleashing chaos in the cyber network to dominate the world. The most evil Navi is PharaohMan.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to be the first player to complete their mission and defeat the Evil Pharaoman! Players travel around the Battle Network searching for Battlechips that will make their NetNavis more powerful. They must be careful as dangerous computer virus may attack as they search for important Item tiles that will complete their mission cards allowing them to find and fight PharaohMan.&#10;&#10;"

13094,,"Category Game is a party game about finding words: a 5x5 plastic grid with 5 &quot;word category&quot; cards (placed over the columns) and 5 letter tiles (placed at the left border of the rows)is filled with 25 marbles (whose value is 1, 2 or 3 points). Any marble is placed in a cell in the grid, whose position is corresponding to a category column and a letter row: you can take the marble finding a word in the category of the column, beginning with the letter in the row.&#10;&#10;For instance, if the category is &quot;Games&quot;, and letter is &quot;C&quot;, you can also say... &quot;Category Game&quot;!  Players are arranged in teams, then the starting player has 15 seconds to try to get as many marbles as he can, saying words matching the category on the column, and beginning with the letter on the row. The uncomplete grid is then passed to the next player, who has 15 seconds to take some of the remaining marbles, and so on. When the grid is empty, or when everyone passes (i.e. when you only have on the grid marbles corresponding to a difficult or impossible letter/category match), points are scored. Category cards and letter tiles are then changed, marbles are randomly put again on the grid, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Category Game is a very nice reworking of a traditional pencil and paper game: I appreciate the fast pace induced by the 15 seconds sandtimer, the partnership play, the good assortment of category cards, and... the arguing! In effect, some of the cards are an undoubtful source for arguments (or - when the going get tough - for &quot;marbles wars&quot;... be careful!): &quot;Into the sea&quot;, for instance... What if someone says &quot;Cars&quot; or &quot;Chairs&quot;? Shouldn't cars or chairs get into the sea?&#10;&#10;"

If the pad is the same color as your plane's stripes, you take it and place it in front of you (thus the number of landing pads shrinks as the game progresses). If all pads of the color spun are occupied you stay where you are until your next turn. The first player to collect all four of their color landing pads is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

13165,,"Owzthat is a simulation of the game of cricket using dice.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two unique dice; one of them labelled with numbers, the other with words. The idea is that the player who is &quot;in&quot; rolls the numbered die, scoring the number of runs as shown on the die. This continues until he rolls the side of the die with the word &quot;Owzthat!&quot; (a corruption of &quot;How's that&quot;, an appeal in cricket). Then, the other die is rolled. The faces on this die show different ways of being out, such as caught, bowled, etc. On this die are also two ways of being not out i.e. the appeal is turned down. If the player is not out, he continues to roll the first die. If he is out, he continues his innings with his next batsman, as in a real game of cricket.&#10;&#10;"

All playing pieces are in full view allowing the players to anticipate each strategic move.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    1 Playing Board with 93 hexagon (six sided) shapes called Tangle Tiles.&#10;    116 Playing Pieces &ndash; 29 of each color.&#10;    4 Scoring Keys&#10;    4 Storage Trays&#10;    4 Scoring Rims&#10;&#10;&#10;Object Of Game:&#10;The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.&#10;&#10;How To Score Points:&#10;1. When a player encloses all six sides of a Tangle Tile with his particular color playing pieces, he has captured that tile and scores points.&#10;2. Tangle playing pieces-values:&#10;&#10;    Only the final piece that completes the surrounding of the Tangle Tile counts toward point value and only if all six sides of the Tangle Tile are surrounded by the same color.&#10;&#10;&#10;3. Each playing piece has its own point value.&#10;Note: There are six shapes from small to large point values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, and 5 points.&#10;4. Tangle Tile values:&#10;The Tangle Tiles on the board also have point values, which are added to the value of the final playing piece that completes the surrounding of a Tangle Tile. These values are as follows:&#10;&#10;    Plain Tile &ndash; 1 point.&#10;    Circular Design Tile &ndash; 2 points&#10;    Triangular Design Tile &ndash; 2 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.&#10;    Square Design Tile &ndash; 4 points plus double the value of the completing Tangle playing piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Play:&#10;1. Each player&rsquo;s first turn must start with one side of his playing piece touching one of the six sides of the Center Star Tangle Tile.&#10;2. Players alternate turns.&#10;3. All pieces in play must be continuously connected (regardless of color) even when blocking.&#10;4. If a player places a playing piece on the board which does not complete a Tangle Tile his turn ends.&#10;5. A player is entitled to an immediate extra turn for every Tangle Tile he completely surrounds in his own color.&#10;6. Total points are kept on the scoring rim as each Tangle Tile is surrounded.&#10;&#10;Conclusion Of Game:&#10;Play is ended when one player has used all his playing pieces or when one player has reached the total of 50 points.&#10;&#10;Winner:&#10;The player with the highest total of points when the game ends.&#10;&#10;Play For Partners:&#10;Partners sit facing each other. If Green and Blue pieces are on one team, points are scored for that team when tiles are surrounded 1. All in Green, 2. All in Blue, or 3. In Blue and Green.&#10;&#10;"

The farmer, sensing a surfer's hunger for the sport, reluctantly grants permission to trespass.  His only request, &quot;don't let the rabbits out of the pen - or they'll reproduce and eat my produce.&quot;  Well, curiosity doesn't kill the cat here, but it does create a stir, when one surfer inadvertently opens the pen containing the rabbits the farmer had retrieved from his property.
