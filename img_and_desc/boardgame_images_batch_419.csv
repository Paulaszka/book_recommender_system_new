They must choose an item depicted on one of the cards laying at the center of the table and use it to continue the story.

Both players have to use the same two objects, but the second one speaking cannot use them in the same way than the first (more or less compensating the fact he had more time to prepare his part).&#10;&#10;Eventually, the teller decides which of the two finalists wins, depending on the relevance of their proposals.&#10;&#10;The game comes with two proposed variants :&#10;- &quot;Experienced players&quot; : all the players tell the same tale, each one adding an element to the same storyline and bound to continue using the plot of the former speakers.&#10;- &quot;Collective&quot; : there are no quill markers and appraisal given by the teller.

The larger board comprised of four pages&#10;with smaller hexes was designed for a larger group of players and for those who enjoy longer more detailed game play.

Try both and play the one that best suits your style of play.&#10;&#10;As each player takes their turn, they must first move their pawn 6 hexes. They then have the option to stay where they are or roll 2d6 (two six sided dice) and moving their pawn across the board one hex at a time the number of hexes shown on the dice. Movement can be forward left, forward right or forward. Moving a pawn backward on the track is not permitted. Only one&#10;pawn can occupy a hex at a time. If a pawn is in your way, you must move around it. The player also has the option to move&#10;the pawn less hexes than indicated on the dice (example: a player rolling 10 can move only 7 hexes if they wish). If a pawn&rsquo;s path is blocked by other pawns and it is impossible to move forward while moving the base 6 hexes, the player must choose which pawn to stop behind. The player and the owner of the other pawn must both roll from the Accident Chart.&#10;&#10;"

Each set of adjacent 4 squares is grouped into a quadrant, and labeled from A to Y, starting from the top, left hand side quadrant. Each square in a quadrant is numbered from 1 to 4, starting from the top, left hand side square.&#10;&#10;One player is allocated the 6 quadrant in the top-left hand side of the board as his home sector, and the other takes the 6 quadrant in the bottom-right hand side of the board as his. The remaining 13 quadrants form the neutral sector. The corner quadrants in each player's home sector are their respective home quadrants.&#10;&#10;Each player receives 45 points to create stars in the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Quadrat Z is very much a game of cat-and-mouse. As in many wars, you have some idea of an opponent's strength and general location, but very little about the exact composition and location of his forces. Hence, the value of intelligence gathering should not be underrated.&#10;&#10;Strategy will vary from game to game, but a major focus should be on the capture of stars: without them your forces will not grow, and , in the long run their lack will certainly cause you to lose. Think carefully about the initial layout of stars, and place your ships to capture the maximum number of points as soon as possible. Try and maintain a balanced force of ship sizes. Movement is hidden, and fairly rapid shifts of forces from one quadrant to another are possible. Remember that in combat the aim is to have the largest combined force - not necessarily a single, high value ship. A single, large strike ship may penetrate enemy lines and take out the opponent's home base... but if he sees it coming he may have time to regroup and knock it out. Spreading your ships out too thinly in a quadrant could also be problematic in combat.&#10;&#10;"
