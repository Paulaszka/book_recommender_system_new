285257,,"Object of the game: To capture the most pebbles.&#10;&#10;Starting: Cards are shuffled and each player draws three cards. A card is drawn from the pile and placed in the middle face up. This will be the card that the first player builds on. Group chooses who will go first and players take turns going clockwise. Figure 1 below shows an example of a card being played on from the deck. Noticed that a pebble is placed on two overlapping red squares.&#10;&#10;Cards: There are 80 cards made up of three colored squares per card. Cards are placed on top of each other so that at least one of the three squares on the card lays on top of another square of a card with the same color.  Red squares can only go on top of red squares, blue squares can only go on top of blue squares, etc. More than one square can go on top of other squares if the squares laid on top of other squares matches the same color. If a player is unable to lay a card on top of another card then they are skipped to the next player. Figure 2 below shows how a card can be placed on top of two other cards.&#10;&#10;Cards must also be able to match colors when adjacent sides are touching other adjacent sides. Figure 3 shows an examples of a card that is not acceptable because the yellow square does not match the red square.&#10;&#10;Pebbles: Players draw from the pile of black pebbles when placing a pebble on a square. Only black pebbles are played on cards, white and red pebbles are used to reduce the number of black pebbles needed in a game. Black pebbles have a value of one point. Every time a player collects 5 black pebbles they turn them into the pile to replenish it and take one white pebble which is worth the 5 black pebbles. A red pebble is worth 10 black pebbles.&#10;&#10;Pebble Placement: Where ever a card square overlaps another card square a pebble is placed on that square. Up to three pebbles can be placed in one turn if a card is placed that overlaps three squares of the same colors. Figure 4 shows an example of one card being placed on top of three other squares. Three black pebbles are placed on top of each square that matches.&#10;&#10;Capturing Pebbles: Capturing is done by jumping pebbles. A pebble can jump another pebble as long as there is a space (square from a card) to jump into over a pebble. Pebbles can jump in any direction. Multiple jumps can be made in one turn as long as there is a pebble next to another pebble and a space to space to jump into. Figure 5 shows an example of jumps that can be made in one turn. There are other combinations to jumping than what is shown in Figure 5.&#10;&#10;End of Game: The game ends when all the cards are used up from the deck and the player&rsquo;s hands. Who ever has the most points in their pile wins.&#10;&#10;"

285259,,"Nature&rsquo;s Card Game: The magic of nature&rsquo;s patterns can be written in the language of numbers. The Phinacci game has taken that numbering pattern and made a card game out of it.&#10;&#10;How to Play: You have two teams, four players, 53 cards, and 144 points needed to win the game. The object is to be the first team to reach 144 points. Each card taken in a pile counts as one point. Teams capture cards in a pile by matching the pile value with the card they throw down onto the pile. There are two groups of cards; colored cards with black numbers and black cards with white numbers. The colored cards are used only in subtracting the number that is on the card from the value of the pile, and the black cards can be used to either add or subtract the number on the card from the pile. If a player does not match the value on the pile then players continue going clockwise to lay down a card until the value is matched. The pile value changes each time a card is placed on the pile. The team (lead team) who lays down the first card of the hand has the advantage of either matching or exceeding the number value on the pile to take it, where as the other team must match the pile value exactly. If neither team has the cards to match or go over (lead team) the value on the pile then the cards go to the (non-lead team), and they become the lead team on the next round. There will be times when a player is unable to place a card and they are skipped to the next player. There will also be times when a player will run out of cards before the other players do.&#10;&#10;An example of play: The deck is shuffled and dealt to all four players with one extra card going into the middle face up.Let&rsquo;s say the extra card is a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo;. Team A (lead team) easily takes it by throwing a &lsquo;colored 1&rsquo; card on top of it. Any card they throw down will take it because all they have to do is match or exceed the pile value. Because there were two cards in the pile they receive two points for their team. The player that takes the pile gets to lead out. Now let&rsquo;s say the player who took the pile leads out with an &lsquo;8&rsquo; card. The player on the left, Team B (non-lead team) member can place an 8 down if they have one and take the pile of two cards to collect two points, or let&rsquo;s say they choose to throw down a &lsquo;colored 1&rsquo; card which subtracts from the existing &lsquo;8&rsquo; making the pile value 7. The next person on the left is a member of Team A cannot match that pile number, because there are no &lsquo;7&rsquo; in the deck, but because they are the Lead Team they can use an &lsquo;8&rsquo; or larger card to take the pile, but it would only be three cards. Let&rsquo;s say instead they decide to throw down a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo; card. Now the pile value is 6 with four cards in the pile. Now let&rsquo;s say Team B throws down a colored &lsquo;2&rsquo; to bring it down to a value of 4. Again there are no &lsquo;4&rsquo; cards and the lead team has to either use a &lsquo;5&rsquo; card or larger to take it. Let&rsquo;s say Team A throws down a black &lsquo;5&rsquo; and chooses to use that &lsquo;5&rsquo; to add to the pile instead of subtracting. Now the pile value is 9 and again there are no &lsquo;9&rsquo; cards in the deck, so Team B will be unable to take the pile at this point. Let&rsquo;s say they throw down an &lsquo;8&rsquo; card bringing the pile value to 1. Team A decides to take the pile with a colored &lsquo;1&rsquo;, thus gaining 7 more point from this pile.. The hand will continued to be played until either all the cards are used up, or nobody is able to play a card. At that point the cards are reshuffled and dealt out with the team taking the last pile leading off. Team B&rsquo;s strategy is to keep the pile value so high that the other team will not be able to match or exceed its value, thus giving them the pile and becoming the lead team for the next round.&#10;&#10;"

Each player has six cubes that can slide, push and spin. Each cube starts out with the ability to move in three different directions; horizontally, vertically or diagonally. All 12 cubes will remain on the board throughout the game whether they are able to move or not. Cubes must always move in a straight line and cannot pass another cube diagonally if that cube&rsquo;s side comes in contact. A cube may not jump over another cube, or land on top of another cube. A cube loses a direction of movement as indicated by colored triangle when a cube from the other player is pushed into it. It is possible to engage more than one cube at a time. Cubes without colored triangles are considered dead and are unable to move on their own, though it can be pushed by other cubes. Cubes can push other cubes, both their own or their opponent, but for this to happen there must be more triangles pointing in the direction of the push than there are triangles opposed to the push. If two cubes have opposing triangles that point into each other, they cancel each other out and there is no push either way. Cubes may not pull another cube. Cubes can only move forward in the direction of the 90 degree triangles. Triangles can turn a round when they reach the three gray squares at each end, and can move back and forth from those gray squares. When a player runs out of moves the game is over.&#10;&#10;"

What might feel like an advanced form of checkers will surprise you in its complexity of moves and strategy. It requires a nimble mind and the forward thinking of a chess player. Be alert because the balance of power can shift very quickly in this game.&#10;&#10;Game basics:&#10;Each player starts out with 4 kings and 13 squires. Kings must always stay on white squares and squires must always stay on brown squares. Only squires can capture kings and only kings can capture squires. Capture happens when a king or squire moves into an adjacent space that shares the same sides. Both kings and squires can jump forward if they have a piece to jump over. They can jump over their own pieces or their opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or a combination of both. When a player&rsquo;s king or squire reaches the opponent&rsquo;s side of the board their king changes into an emperor or their squire changes into a knight. These changes give the pieces enhanced abilities to move. It is possible to reach the opposite side of the board in one jump, or a combination of multiple jumps in a single turn.&#10;&#10;Examples of moves:&#10;&#10;     A silver squire moves into an adjacent space to capture an emperor. Squires must always move a forward motion and cannot move sideways.&#10;     A silver squire jumps over an opponent&rsquo;s squire and king to capture the king. Bridges can be formed from both a players pieces and an opponent&rsquo;s pieces.&#10;     A silver king makes multiple jumps to reach the opponent&rsquo;s side and change into an emperor and capture two silver squires. Capture only happens at the final resting point and not at each junction where a piece launches from one jumping point to the next.&#10;     A silver king traverses across two spaces to capture four gold squires. Kings, emperors and knights can traverse (go sideways) as long as there is not another piece blocking its path. A piece cannot jump over or go around pieces when traversing.&#10;     A gold squire makes two jumps to become a knight and capture two silver kings.&#10;     A silver knight traverses three spaces to capture two gold kings. When a squires changes into a knight it gains the ability to traverse and move forward or backwards. When a king changes into an emperor it can also move forward or backwards, but it also has the ability to jump to the next row of white spaces without needing a bridge.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Tiles only connect when the terrain of the shared edge is passable.&#10;&#10;Each player starts out with a single building next to a small resource deposit and is only allowed to expand their outpost to connected tiles that are unclaimed by other players. This must be done as the total number of resources that may be extracted from the resource deposit is limited.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, new resource deposits will be discovered. In order to obtain the valuable resources, players must construct buildings capable of harvesting the resource in the direct proximity of the resource deposit.&#10;&#10;The game features several different building types that may be constructed, each with their own perks and granting a certain number of victory points. Resources are consumed when buildings are constructed so players will have to form a strategy and adapt depending on how the game develops.&#10;&#10;Agressive players may construct buildings capable of recruiting troops and attack other players' buildings and/or troops. Defensive players may construct defensive structures to prevent agressive players from reaching their resource producing buildings. Terrain can also be used as an advantage.&#10;&#10;A player may be heavily decimated from the attack of another player. It is even possible for players to coordinate their attacks against a stronger opponent and prevent them from dominating the game. Although rare, players can even be completely eliminated from the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends in the turn where the last tile is placed. Players compute the total number of victory points awarded from each of their buildings left standing and the player with the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Extraction is a fundamental mechanism of most industries, with a small few accumulating great wealth by extracting value from the earth and the majority of its population.
