Fight to free the helpless abductees! Fight to throw the aggressors back into space and end forever their power to threaten humanity!&#10;&#10;Thus was born the Rocket Patrol &ndash; an organization of brave and hearty women and men dedicated to defending humanity and taking the fight to the alien menace from the stars.&#10;&#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions is a cooperative, scenario-based, tactical action game for 1-6 players, which is set in the Golden Age of science fiction. In this game, the third standalone title in the Space Cadets franchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.&#10;&#10;Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.&#10;&#10;Space Cadets: Away Missions contains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.&#10;&#10;"

Any suit combination of these cards is sufficient for a &quot;sloppy capture&quot;, but a &quot;noble capture&quot; (all items of the same suit) allows you to capture up to three students simultaneously. Noble captures also allow additional game actions.&#10;&#10;Suits in the game are &quot;cute&quot;, &quot;sexy&quot;, &quot;sporty&quot;, and &quot;smart&quot;. Cultural events (such as Sports Day) and special personalities can also modify the basic game play.&#10;&#10;"

Each card has the potential to do more than one thing, but can only ever be used for a single thing at any given time. The game is played in alternating rounds. The active player first chooses whether or not volleys will be fired by both sides. Then he decides whether to play a card for its event, or activate a group of units to march, rally, charge, or bombard. To activate a force a number of cards need to be discarded for their &quot;span&quot; number based on the distance from the commander to the force. The action also determines how many new cards may be drawn, the more vigorous action the fewer cards. Or he could also choose to pass and draw more cards. A group of units depends on their physical proximity, type, and formation. An additional card may be played to modify an action. The passive player might have interrupt cards that enable him to inject complications into the &#10;active player&rsquo;s action. The game continues until one side&rsquo;s army morale breaks. If neither side&rsquo;s army morale breaks before the game runs out of cards, then night has fallen without a decisive victory.&#10;&#10;"

The chaining system can lead to massive scores and ultimate victory.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players select which Virxle (color) they are going after and set up an initial board.  Then, on their turn, they can play a card (Special Program or Circuit Card), load a program (placing a token on a detonation node), or run a program (setting off the program and scoring Virxles in your path).  Circuit Cards contain Virxles and detonation points, which players put down, building the board as they play. When running a program, the detonation node has a set distance (in one of the cardinal directions) the explosion travels.  If it can reach another detonation point, a chain begins and can continue for up to 9 detonations points.  Bonus points are scored for longer chains.&#10;&#10;More advanced rules variants introduce Virxles the player must avoid as they become negative points.&#10;&#10;"
