Future games will expand the system to the late war.&#10;&#10;Players fly squadrons and flights, attempting to intercept raids or fend off marauding fighters in fast-playing games that take between 90 and 120 minutes.&#10;&#10;Wing Leader takes a new look at aerial warfare, incorporating aircraft, altitude, and weather in a way never seen before!&#10;&#10;The second game in the series is Wing Leader: Supremacy 1943-1945. &#10;For the Second Edition (version 2.2) see Wing Leader: Victories 1940-1942 (Second Edition).&#10;&#10;"

It includes 72 tiles, consisting of 63 tiles released in the original base game, 6 from Inns &amp; Cathedrals, 1 from Traders &amp; Builders and 2 from King &amp; Scout. It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.&#10;&#10;Nineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.&#10;&#10;Play of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.&#10;&#10;Bridges, Castles and Bazaars is the eighth expansion for Carcassonne. It allows players three new options while playing:&#10;&#10;Bridges may be used to continue a road over a field tile, thereby allowing an incomplete road to technically run into a field segment. They are otherwise treated and scored just like roads.&#10;&#10;Castle tokens are placed atop 2-segment cities and allow players a chance to cash-in on the next completed adjacent feature.&#10;&#10;Bazaars are a new type of tile that allows players to auction off tiles in exchange for points.&#10;&#10;"

To combat this threat, Lady Penelope, the Thunderbirds&rsquo; aristocratic English secret agent, and her chauffeur Parker lead a network of agents to uncover those behind the disasters caused by deliberate sabotage.&#10;&#10;A criminal mastermind known as &ldquo;The Hood&rdquo;, operating from a temple deep in the Malaysian jungle and in possession of strange powers, often engineers events to allow him to spy on the Thunderbird machines with the goal of selling their secrets to the highest bidder.&#10;&#10;The iconic Thunderbirds are designed by the Tracy family&rsquo;s close friend &ldquo;Brains&rdquo; and are assigned to each of the five Tracy brothers:&#10;- Thunderbird 1, piloted by Scott Tracy &ndash; a hypersonic rocket plane used for fast response and rescue-zone reconnaissance, and as a mobile control base.&#10;- Thunderbird 2, piloted by Virgil Tracy &ndash; a supersonic VTOL carrier which transports their major rescue equipment in detachable pods.&#10;- Thunderbird 3, piloted by Alan Tracy &ndash; a single-stage, vertically launched spacecraft&#10;- Thunderbird 4, piloted by Gordon Tracy &ndash; a utility submersible for underwater rescue, launched from Thunderbird 2&#10;- Thunderbird 5, manned by John Tracy &ndash; a space station in geo-stationary orbit that monitors calls for help from across Earth.&#10;&#10;Finally, Lady Penelope has the iconic FAB 1, driven by Parker &ndash; a pink, amphibious car.&#10;&#10;Thunderbirds is a cult 1960s British science-fiction television series, created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson.

You draw a card from a deck and search for an object that satisfies the request on the card. The cards come in three colors to identify their difficulty level. When you find the object, place it on the table, move your pawn one step further on the score board and draw another card. When a pawn crosses a Challenge Line for the first time, the game stops for a while and a Challenge is played. The game ends when a pawn reaches or crosses the 16th box on the score board.&#10;&#10;"

Players take turn eliminating the haunting from the rooms of the manor and dealing with whatever Visitor that might appear.&#10;&#10;The game ends after all the Visit cards have been used, meaning that they have successfully managed to stop their invasion. It will also end if 3 Visitors are present in the board at the same time, as they have become too strong to be defeated now.&#10;&#10;Players are allocated 3 action points on their turn, and can choose to move to an adjacent room or to use a trinket in order to destroy a manifestation. Each Visitor brought on to the board makes the game harder as more Visit cards have to be drawn, with the extra effect of speeding up gameplay.&#10;&#10;With a modular board and rules that allow for difficulty tweaking, no two playthroughs will be the same!&#10;&#10;"

One player can move the pawns along columns, while the other moves them along rows. Players cannot move the same pawn they moved the previous turn, so strategy is built around knowing which choices your opponent has next, and working to make those choices miserable &mdash; thus putting them in a dilemma. Some of the tiles affect the board when collected: moving tiles or pawns, returning pieces to the board, or stealing tiles from an opponent. When neither player can move, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Skillful maneuvering and forethought are the name of the game in this engaging, classical board game.&#10;&#10;"
