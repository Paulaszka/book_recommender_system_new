15148,,"Quoting from the review at http://flyhi.de/games/dampfundstahl1.html:&#10;&#10;Steam and Steel is a game of naval power and economy; the objective is to gain the commercial and military superiority on the oceans. The crucial areas, or rather points, of the map are the ports, and the units at the player's disposal are his warships. The winner is the player that controls the largest port capacity at the end of the game, i.e. after a certain number of game turns or a predetermined time.&#10;&#10;&quot;Players gain income from their ports. They spend their income for increasing port capacity, fortifying ports, building shipyards, and building ships. Ships have no inherent value towards the objective of the game, but they are necessary to protect the bases. New technology makes older ships obsolete, forcing players to constantly upgrade their fleets.&#10;&#10;&quot;When opposing ships or fleets meet, or ships enter a fortified port, game play switches to short interludes of tactical battle.&quot;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Steam  and Steel: Expansion Set 1&#10;&#10;&#10;"

15152,,"Mind Duel - Psionic Combat for Two players&#10;&#10;In issue #4 of the magazine &quot;VIP of Gaming&quot;.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mind Duel is a game of psychic combat between two trained telepaths. You attack your opponent's mind and defend your own, with focused bits of psionic energy...By invading your opponent's mind, you may stun your enemy, or pinch a pressure point and cause the loss of those focused bits of psi-power. Your object is to occupy the opponent's conscious mind, whereupon the enemy will black out, never to awaken again.&quot;&#10;&#10;Game consists of the rules, gameboard and cut-apart counters found in the magazine and 2D6.&#10;&#10;The gameboard  represents the telepaths' minds and the area of mental struggle between them. Each mind is divided into conscious, subconscious and unconscious levels (the &quot;mental arcs&quot;). The area between the battling minds is divided into a series of wavelength arcs.&#10;&#10;Basic Play: 1-Announce your attacking pieces (pieces that will move). 2-Pieces not moving then &quot;decay&quot; (fall back due to lack of support). 3-Move the attacking pieces. 4-&quot;Shift&quot; if you choose and are able. 5-Apply any attack results. Sending a piece into your opponent's mind is an attack. Attacking the Unconscious stuns the opponent for one turn. Attacking the Subconscious permanently eliminates your opponent's furthest advanced piece. Attacking the Conscious defeats the opponent and wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

The grid shows project locations, matching the 14 project tiles, coded 'Project A' through 'Project N'. Every project square shows the potential maximum points that a single player can gain from that project.&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;Lay project tiles on a board, and surround them with expertise tiles. When a project has enough expertise, it is completed, and the player that contributed the most expertise wins.&#10;&#10;During their turn, players throw the die and move the round-marker along the game-board as many spaces as the die indicates. Depending on the place the round-marker ends on, one of several things may happen. Sometimes a project tile may be drawn from the draw bag and placed on the board. Or the active player may draw one expertise chip from the faced-down set and place it on the board. In order to do this, they must move their score marker backwards on the track as many places as is indicated on the expertise chip that they have drawn. Another option would be drawing a play-card, which are similar to Monopoly chance cards.&#10;&#10;When a project has enough expertise added to it (by placing expertise chip next to it) players see who gets how many points from their contributions. They then move their score marker forwards on the track the same number of points that they have collected from the project. The expertise chip attached to the project do not recycle back into the draw pile.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a per-determined number of rounds (based on the number of players) has been played or when all projects have been completed or when all expertise chips have been used up.&#10;&#10;Note:&#10;This game was supported by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management.&#10;&#10;"

He can play a face down card and announce the current vegetable (he says &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;, but also doesn&rsquo;t need to play one). Or he can doubt the card of the previous player. In the latter case he looks at the previous card. If the previous player has lied (he did not play a &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;), that player has to draw a number of cards. If the previous player did not lie, the doubting player has to draw the cards. It is possible to play an action card in stead of a vegetable card. With an action card you can change the direction of the game, change the current vegetable or force a player to draw extra cards.

The players create armies of different sizes and nationalities and must use all of the skill and knowledge of strategy they possess to defeat their opponents. Rules are provided on how to play the games, but these can be looked upon as guidelines. It will constantly be stressed that this is your system and the rules can be altered to suit your particular style of play. The games can be played as simple or complicated as you prefer. Because of the endless variety of combat situations which can be constructed, we hope players will never tire of the system.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We offer 5 books within the system, each one covering 300 weapons. There are 2 aircraft books, 2 naval books and 1 armor book. This means a total of 1,500 weapons are covered. A total of over 1,000,000 of these weapons were produced and we provide production figures for all of them. Our playing pieces are larger than those offered by other gaming companies and are presented in a variety of shapes which look like the weapons they have been chosen to represent. Our playing pieces are available in four different 4 color camouflage patterns. A national insignia sheet is also available in full color and contains over 500 insignias from over a dozen countries. When applied to the playing pieces, these insignias combined with the size, shape and camouflage patterns provide an air of realism and excitement never before attainable at the price they are offered.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Because of the larger size of our playing pieces, it stands to reason our hexes must be larger to accommodate them. In keeping with our policy of non-restriction, a stencil is available within our system which allows the player to trace this hex pattern across any playing surface they choose. A readily available and inexpensive playing surface is poster board (22&quot; x 28&quot;). Two of these boards butted together make a good beginner size and three boards make a good overall size for any type of gaming activity. These boards can be left plain, or full color scenarios can be drawn on them prior to tracing the hex pattern. Even those players with limited artistic ability can create personalized scenarios with a little time and patience. Maps can be purchased of oceans, continents and individual countries. These maps are relatively inexpensive, are good size for gaming and make for an extremely attractive playing surface. County survey maps can also be acquired, as well as city and county street indexes for those who wish to engage in street fighting. A hex pattern sheet is also provided with our stencil which can be inexpensively reprinted at your local quickie printer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A map or scenario can also be applied to a window shade and our design traced across it. The shade can be stretched across the playing area and retained at the ends while in use. For those with a permanent playing table, shade brackets can be attached to one edge of the table and the shade snapped in. The pull tab can be retained at the opposite edge with the aid of a nail. In this way the shade will rest squarely on the table top and remain taut. A variety of shades can be prepared and used as they are needed. This should be especially appealing for clubs. Games can also be played on non-hex surfaces by simply substituting inches for hex speed, which is contained in the WARGAME CHARTS. Remember, we will recommend how the games should be played, but the final decision is up to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

You must throw doubles before you can move (thus starting a fire), but after that you can move regardless of what you roll. Each time a double of a house already on fire is rolled, a block from that building is removed.&#10;&#10;To put out a fire, both spaces in front of a building must be occupied by a fire engine. Each truck then scores points equal to the remaining number of blocks for that building. If you own both fire engines, the second truck scores double points as a bonus.
