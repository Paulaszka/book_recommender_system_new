To get them back home, you need to work together! Players will need to cooperate, negotiate, share and learn to work as a team in order to achieve a common goal and win the game.&#10;&#10;What's unusual?&#10;&#10;The most novel thing about this game is the playing field, which is constructed by the players during the game.&#10;&#10;The card forming the shape of the paddock is a 7&times;7 square. The ponies and the hay go inside, filling out a 5&times;5 square. As soon as the outer perimeter of the paddock closes, the ponies can no longer walk out and the game is lost. However, if we manage to fill the 5&times;5 paddock with ponies and hay, then the game is won. Remember, the secret is to work together!&#10;&#10;How to play?&#10;&#10;During his turn a player needs to take two types of action &ndash; one prevents victory, while the other brings it closer.&#10;&#10;What prevents victory is the need to build the paddock by playing all the available fence cards in one&rsquo;s hand.&#10;&#10;What brings it closer is putting 3 ponies which have some trait in common into the paddock or using the horseshoe to break two fence cards or adding one hay card into the paddock.&#10;&#10;Note that players can share cards to help each other collect the three ponies that they need. You can also discuss and plan moves together, as well as judge whether or not a certain action will be useful. The players are not competing, they are trying to win by working together.&#10;&#10;In order to win, the players need to fill the paddock with hay and ponies before the fence is completed. Otherwise the game is lost.&#10;&#10;Who can play?&#10;&#10;This game is ideal for children who are 4+ years old, as well as mixed groups of kids and adults and families. Great as a fun activity in day care centers, at parties and during trips.&#10;&#10;"

Soult's plan was to defeat Beresford and therefore relieve the British siege of Badajoz. A Spanish contingent, however, had just united with Beresford, and the combined British, Portuguese, and Spanish force now outnumbered the French. Soult attacked anyway, and his plan to outflank the enemy worked well - in the beginning&hellip; but a determined defense ultimately repulsed the attack.  Can you as Soult decisively prevail against the Allies or as Beresford falter and flounder in the face of French aggression?

For that to have happened, two changes in the timeline need have taken place during the first half of that year.&#10;&#10;First, Churchill would&rsquo;ve had to put off the British general election until after Japan was defeated. He had the political leverage to do that, but against all good advice he chose not to do so. He mistakenly believed the recent victory over Nazi Germany was enough to sustain his coalition government in power.&#10;&#10;Second, he would have had to convince US President Harry Truman, then only recently come into office after the death of FDR, that preemptive war against the Soviets was the best choice among a limited number of strategic options. A close study of the debate that went on historically within the White House and Pentagon at the time concerning the idea indicates that, by March 1946, those Washington powerbrokers had become convinced a new World War &ndash; with the USSR as the primary enemy &ndash; was indeed coming and coming soon. Had that conviction taken hold in Washington just eight months sooner &ndash; and it well might have, had Stalin or Tito been only a little more aggressive in their territorial and political demands &ndash; this would not be an alternative history design.&#10;&#10;The general flow of the game inescapably has the Allies on the offensive at its start. On the Soviet side, that player is immediately faced with a decision to either &ldquo;fight forward,&rdquo; with Berlin as the central core of that gambit, or retreating east with the idea of slowly wearing down the Allied offensive and then counterattacking into its flanks late in the game. Further, though the Allies have the ability to make paradrops and amphibious invasions, they lack the dedicated manpower necessary to make such gambits automatically decisive. Most games are decided either in and around Berlin or somewhere east of the Oder-Neisse line.&#10;&#10;Each hex on the map represents eight miles (13 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one week. Each unit of maneuver represents a corps or army. There are 192 medium-size (9/16&rdquo;) units. Complexity is low-intermediate, and a game can be completed in under four hours. The system is solitaire friendly.&#10;&#10;"

Many flower farmers strive for a better Kiku. There are flower festivals where you can find and buy many flowers, and so a festival focused on Kiku is &#232;&#143;&#138;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#231;&#165;&#173;, especially with plants shown in competition. But &#232;&#179;&#189; (sai) is dice, so &#232;&#143;&#138;&#232;&#138;&#177;&#232;&#179;&#189; is also Kikkasai, making a Flower Festival Dice game.&#10;&#10;The game follows the style of Mahjong, drawing dice from a bag, rolling, discarding, trying to complete sets. In this game, you only handle 2 + 1 dice, so your target is to create one single set. Many of the rules match Mahjong; draw 1 discard 1, claiming the dice your opponent discards, or the rule of &quot;trend&quot; which gives you extra points (like the Dora rule in Mahjong).&#10;&#10;Initially, one die is placed as the &quot;trend&quot;. You get extra points for winning a hand by using a same colored die / same pip with the trend die. Then each player grabs 2 dice from the bag and rolls behind their screen. These dice are the players' hands.&#10;&#10;Each turn, if you can use the last die discarded by your opponent to complete your set, you declare and win the round. If not, you grab a die from the bag and roll. If the 3 dice (2 in your hand and 1 just rolled) completes your hand, you win the round and score points. If not, you must discard 1 die, either from your hand, or the rolled one. Be careful not to toss out a die your opponent wants. Now the turn switches to your opponent.&#10;&#10;The round ends when any player wins, or the bag is out of dice. Put all the dice back in the bag. If any player has 0 points or less, that player loses. Or else, start a new round, switching the starting player.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;A 2 player game of dice-Mahjong.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in the Finals of a Flower show competition for prize Chrysanthemum. You aim for the victory by completing your set of Chrysanthemum dice. Both players start from 6 points, and you win by depleting your opponents' points to 0.&#10;&#10;Basic game set is for 2, but combining 2 sets would allow you to play by 3 or 4 players.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#233;&#186;&#187;&#233;&#155;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#143;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#147;&#129;&#232;&#169;&#149;&#228;&#188;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#143;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#143;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#132;&#170;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#187;&#229;&#159;&#186;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#239;&#188;&#147;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#148;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

It consists of two numbered decks each of 50 cards. One of these decks has Sentence cards, each with six numbered sentences; the other deck has the matching Master cards, showing the proper pronunciation of each difficult word in the sentences.&#10;&#10;The rules provide several variations of the game. In the most basic, the Social Game, each deck is distributed evenly among the players. In turn, each player calls out the number of a Master card in his hand. The player holding the corresponding Sentence card then must slowly and distinctly read the sentence on that card of the Master's choice. If the Master player notices any mistakes, he must confirm what the Sentence player said, and then claims the pair of cards as a &quot;book&quot;; if he notices no mistakes, then the reading player gets the cards. Play then passes to the left, and the player with the most &quot;books&quot; when the cards run out is the winner.&#10;&#10;The deck includes an Arbiter card, with whoever holds it being empowered to decide any disputes. In the Commercial game, the Arbiter card initially counts as a single point, and failed cards go to the Arbiter and count to his score. However, if the Arbiter makes a mistake, the Arbiter card goes to the successful Master player, and its value increases by one.&#10;&#10;In the Professional game, the number of points won is equal to the number of test words correctly pronounced rather than the number of cards; a player missing even a single word scores nothing while the Master gets all the points for the sentence. This introduces an element of strategy for Masters: whether to challenge a given Reader with a long and difficult sentence that could mean a big swing one way or the other, or to choose a short and easier one with less risk and less reward. There are additional rules for Club play and Contests.&#10;&#10;"
