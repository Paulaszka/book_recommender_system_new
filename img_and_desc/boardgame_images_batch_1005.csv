Players do not need to know anything about LARP, The Empire or runes to enjoy the games.&#10;&#10;Runes Way comes with rules for three quick and simple real-time mini-games designed by The Guild of Good Games called The Way of The Runes, The Runes of The Way and Runic Skein'.  There is a further turn-based solo or cooperative game challenge called Paragon's Path.  The cards can also be combined together into The Runes Way Labyrinth puzzle that forms an elaborate structure with hidden meanings for those who seek its secrets. Finally, the cards may also be used for divination purposes using the Wheel of Meaning method of Rune-Reading.&#10;&#10;The Runes Way cards each feature six runes from the world of Empire. One of the runes on each card will match exactly one other rune on any other card - this is a similar feature to that used in the game of Dobble where one symbol on every card matches a symbol on any other card. The Runes Way cards may be placed adjacent to each other to connect matching runes along adjoining edges, enabling cards to be connected into a line - this has similarities to how pieces connect in dominoes.  Since the shapes of many of the runes are very similar, it can be challenging to quickly spot which runes match correctly.&#10;&#10;There are 2 similar but slightly different standard editions of the Runes Way deck (the Blood Red Runes Edition and the Empress Lisabetta Memorial Edition).  These may be combined together to increase the number of players who can play the different games, and to add variety and additional challenge to the gameplay.&#10;&#10;"

It's a premium offering that is more than just a stinking deck of cards. It comes with a play mat that emulates the UI of a CRPG that organizes play into thematic slots for your weapon, shield, armor, helmet, gauntlets, boots, scrolls and your backpack full of loot.&#10;&#10;Rogue Dungeon is highly replayable and is dripping with theme. Not very many games let you go from zero to hero in one hour. It's a loot management game at its core and that's where its charm comes from. You might start the game with a hunk of meat, that you use to charm a wolf who helps you defeat the zombie who drops a lockpick,  which you use to open the safe where you find the jeweled goblet,  which you trade for a lucky shield which you use to negate the Dragon's fire.&#10;&#10;Rogue Dungeon is hard and you will DIE! However, experience and skillful play will ensure that veteran Rogues will make it out of the dungeon alive, more than you will. You, your going to end up in a Goblins belly. Prove us wrong!&#10;&#10;Pick your Rogue, grab your starting loot, grab your skills, set your starting stats and enter the dungeon. Choose which room to navigate to via the mini maps. Rooms are divided into the following types....&#10;&#10;Traders - Offer you a choice to trade loot or stats for other loot, stats, or henchman. Some trades involve a stat test or the luck of a die. Loot traders typically trade two items for any one item they offer for trade. They make exceptions for the shiny stuff and will trade any item for a single treasure.&#10;&#10;Combat - Most combat room have you draw 1 to 3 monsters from the monster deck equal to the dungeon level. Combat is resolved using your Rogues primary stat and a D10. If the two combined are greater than the monsters combat stat your Rogue hits the monster. If they are equal both are hit. If it's less than only the Rogue is hit. Damage can be negated by discarding an armor or by playing a skill or magical item. Potions and food can be consumed at any time to increase your hitpoints to prevent your death. Some monsters have a weakness to specific thematic loot and are vanquished immediately such as when the Medusa gets a look at your face in the mirrors reflection.  Once the monsters hitpoints reach zero the monster dies and you receive one loot and XP equal to the dungeon level.&#10;&#10;Traps - traps litter the dungeon but most can be disarmed or bypassed if you have the appropriate equipment. Even if the gremlins ran off with your rope there is always a chance you can come out unscathed if you pass an appropriate Strength, Agility or Intelligence test. Successful, tests result in an XP reward and negation of any potential damage. Your Mom called and insisted that you should get at least one XP even if you fail the challenge just like in High School.&#10;&#10;All rolls maybe manipulated with the use of the luck stat. Spending one luck will allow you to modify a die result by 1 up or down or allow for a complete reroll.&#10;&#10;Play progresses through 5 dungeon levels separated by a staircase.  You may camp at the stairs without the threat of a wandering monster interrupting your siesta. You may level your Rogue at anytime so long as you have the XP. When you get to the final room draw a boss monster and fight. Boss monsters have special abilities activated depending on your attack roll they can summon additional monsters, drain your level, heal, etc...&#10;&#10;Upon slaying the boss monster...&#10;&#10;Do: Take a photo of your Rogue and discuss your victory on the forums. Then email your Mom, let her know you did do something with your life after all.&#10;&#10;Don't: Call your primary school bully and challenge her to a rematch. She's busy running a fortune 500 company and driving her Lambo.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

This game can be played by ages 9 and up.&#10;&#10;This game exercises your brain as it involves all players to be attentive, continuously making them think, deduce and be alert al all times. It's an easy game to setup which only takes a couple of minutes. Players would need to eventually guess the four cards which are hidden from them at the beginning of the game. A dice makes the game more exciting as it allows players to perform certain actions depending on what is rolled. In this game it is easy to fool any opponent by asking for cards they already have and making it tough for everyone else to follow. &#10;It is a great game for family bonding!&#10;&#10;Best played with 4 players!&#10;&#10;"

The person who has an extra card starts the game by moving a card from his hand to the left, happening like this until someone forms a quartet and silently lowers the cards on the table, so that the others don't see. The last one to lay a card on the table is the &quot;donkey&quot; of the round.&#10;&#10;Each time a player loses, a letter of the word &quot;donkey&quot; is marked. The player who completes the word first, is the &quot;donkey&quot; and will lose of the game. The number of cards that player still has is counted and another card is drawn (called the year of forgiveness). The total number of cards is the losing player's &quot;dumb&quot; years.&#10;&#10;The winner is the last one who has not completed the word &quot;donkey&quot; while the others have.&#10;&#10;---&#10;PT-BR:&#10;A quantidade de cartas &eacute; determinada conforme a quantidade de jogadores, sendo quatro cartas com a mesma numera&ccedil;&atilde;o para cada pessoa que jogar  mais uma carta de &quot;burro&quot;&#10;&#10;O objetivo do jogo &eacute; formar quartetos e n&atilde;o ser o &uacute;ltimo jogador a baixar as cartas na mesa.&#10;&#10;As cartas s&atilde;o embaralhadas e distribu&iacute;das, a pessoa que tiver uma carta a mais come&ccedil;a o jogo passando uma carta da sua m&atilde;o para a esquerda, acontecendo assim at&eacute; que algu&eacute;m forme um quarteto e baixe as cartas na mesa de forma silenciosa, para que os outros distra&iacute;dos  n&atilde;o vejam, o &uacute;ltimo a baixar &eacute; o &quot;burro&quot; da rodada&#10;&#10;Cada vez que um jogador perde, &eacute; assinalada uma letra da palavra &quot;burro&quot;.

You can use any one of thirteen different game sheets for each game; each tells a different chapter from the history of the worms, and has a few unique ways to score. There&rsquo;s one way to lose points on any sheet: leaving worms touching blank space. So fit your worms together cozily!&#10;&#10;At first you need only read 3 pages of rules, and then play Chapter 1, in which the eye is the only organ that has an action: to find food.&#10;&#10;Play at your own pace through the chapters. Each of the first 6 chapters introduces the power of one more of the six organ types: With a mouth, a worm can eat food to grow more organs. With a brain it can get some control of the colony&rsquo;s fate by changing die rolls. With a heart, a worm can grow longer. With a pointy tail it can team up into a &ldquo;Conga Line&rdquo;. And with &ldquo;collars&rdquo;, two worms &ndash; who love each other very much! &ndash; can make short baby worms.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;The game's playtesting and development is documented in: &#10;[WIP] Worm & Cozy - 4th Roll & Write Game Design Contest - Contest Ready.&#10;&#10;"
