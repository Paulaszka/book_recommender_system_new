The launching of the reconstructed trireme Olympias has also provided a great deal of information on the performance of ancient oared warships. These rules are intended to provide a detailed, yet playable, re-enactment of ancient naval warfare based on the latest data.&#10;&#10;They are primarily intended for 1/1200 scale ship models, from small engagements to large ship actions.&#10;&#10;The time period covered by the rules represents a singularly large sweep of history from approximately 3000 BC to 600 AD. In terms of ship types, the rules cater for the earliest paddled ships of the Mediterranean through to the small galleys of the Later Roman Empire. It is the period of the development, supremacy, and decline of the ram equipped galley.&#10;&#10;NAUMACHIAE (pl.) is the Latin name used by the Romans for the 'sea battles' that various emperors staged at their games.

Players represent one city colour &amp; have a set of tiles in 3 shapes in your colour and a set of cards for each city plus 4 action cards. You play a card and place a tile either from your set or from the church or neutral sets. The starting player also first draws a card from a central deck which effectively gives them an extra move. Tiles of the same colour cannot touch and the church tiles allow cities to expand.&#10;&#10;When a city is completed, it is scored. The colour with the most tiles gets the 1st score, the second colour gets half that, the next gets 4 points and the fourth colour gets 2 pts. Therefore it is possible for the neutral colour to score more points than players. The score is a total of the tiles in the city, plus one for each church, plus one for each cathedral place.&#10;&#10;The action cards let you pick up your discards, place a tile to be fixed later, and go first twice (which are discarded). The draw deck cards can be held to score extra points at the end.&#10;&#10;At first the game seems pedestrian, but within a few turns the possibilities become more obvious. Judicious use of the pick-up and turn order cards make a big difference. Not spreading too widely and using the neutral tiles to devalue other cities also matters.&#10;&#10;An interesting placement game that the designer Wolfgang Panning took 2 1/2 years to complete.

Originally called &quot;Shuanglu&quot; it later gained popularity in Japan under the name &quot;Sugoroku.&quot; A Shuanglu set contains mainly a gameboard, 15 white and 15 black pieces and two dice. The gameboard is carved with 12 identical vertical lines, while the dice have six faces carved with the numbers from one to six. First the dice are thrown to determine the steps a player will advance. The player who moves their 15 pieces into the realm of the last six lines earlier is the winner. Since the chance to advance or retreat makes the result unpredictable, the game is highly attractive for gambling.&#10;&#10;Sugoroku comes in 2 varieties: Ban-Sugoroku, which is this game, and Mawari-Sugoroku.&#10;&#10;"

The Sami king, prince and warriors face off against the landowner, his son and tenant farmers. The game is won by a player when his opponent loses all their pieces, cannot make a legal move, or resigns; a draw can be arrived at by mutual agreement or after making a predetermined number of moves per side without a capture.  Pieces capture other pieces by jumping over them.  However, a piece cannot capture another piece above its rank.&#10;&#10;The game is related to the Alquerque family but uses a larger and differently-arranged board.&#10;&#10;"

Players represent aristocratic families at the Court of the Holy Roman Emperor. Players seek to get their family members into influential positions with the various electorships of the Empire. Once there they accumulate votes towards being elected to be Holy Roman Emperor. Players choose actions for their family members to take, which allow them to wrest control of the various Elector States (each of which has a special ability in addition to its voting power) whilst displacing their opponents. However, family members age and die and the number of action cards is limited, restricting the tactical options. As players build their influence they collect victory points and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"
