It consists of electronic pdf files, which the user before the first play, has to print and cut the necessary pieces out. The game emulates the development of an empire, by building villages, gathering resources and in the end constructing military camps and units to conquer the enemy.&#10;&#10;The players in the beggining have only their capital city and some resources. They have to build worker villages next to the field's resource blocks to generate more resources each turn, needed to build more buildings. Specific buildings allow military units to be produced (which also cost resources). The military units can attack the enemy's units or buildings, with a dice rolling battle system.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player who manages to destroy the enemy's capital city!&#10;&#10;"

Each space on the spinner has two colors with associated numbers. When the spinner lands on a spot, both cars with the appropriate color move the number of spaces indicated. (For example: There's a spinner spot that shows a yellow 5 and a blue 3. When the spinner lands on this spot, the Yellow Car moves five spaces, and the Blue Car moves three.&#10;&#10;Cars may change lanes if they have an unoccupied spot to move to. (A car that is boxed in my even move backwards to get free.) If two cars &quot;collide&quot; by occupying the same space, then the car that initiated the collusion is penalized two laps, and the car that got hit, one lap.&#10;&#10;The number of laps is determined by player agreement at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;Game includes a board, four plastic cards, and an insert with a spinner and a series of peg holes to track the laps. (Some plastic pegs are also included.)&#10;&#10;There is no indication of copyright year on the box, but based on other similar titles by the same publisher, it was probably produced in the 1960s.&#10;&#10;"

Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10;    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10;    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid.

Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel.

The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.
