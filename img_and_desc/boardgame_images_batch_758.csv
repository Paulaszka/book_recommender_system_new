Their days were filled with prayer, meditation, and training. As part of their training, they played a single board game. The game was elegant in its simplicity, yet complicated in its mastery. For generations the game was a closely guarded secret and used by the monks to train new acolytes in the art of traversing the narrow passages and treacherous peaks of the Himalayas.&#10;&#10;One day, while the monks were attempting to cross a particularly narrow bit of mountain, a copy of the game was swept away in a snowstorm. It was brought down the mountain by an avalanche and eventually recovered by a small boy from a remote village. The boy was so intrigued by the game that he left his home to wander the mountains, track down the monks and learn the ways of the Malu.&#10;&#10;Many years passed and the boy eventually grew to be an intelligent man, possessing all the secrets of the Malu. He eventually returned to civilization and brought with him the game of the Malu. By sheer chance (or perhaps fate), he has deemed you a worthy challenger. It is now time for you to test your skills... Do you have what it takes to out-think and out-maneuver your opponent and cross the mountain pass in MALU?&#10;&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to move both your pawns across the map to the other side of the board and exit the map. The first player to have both their pawns exit the map wins.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are simple enough that anyone can pick up and start playing, but the depth of skill and many possible strategies to employ, allows for seasoned players to truly be masters of MALU.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player must move their pawn and place a neutral tile onto the board. As you place your tiles, adjoining tiles create paths that your pawns can move along. As your pawn moves, you have the ability to pick up those tiles and reroute them to your advantage... either as a path to the other side or as a means to block your opponents. But be careful... if you get too close, your opponent can snatch those tiles away from you and use them for themselves! You can also place walls of ice and mountain peaks as obstacles or knock down walls for strategic advantages.&#10;&#10;Like many other classic games... first one to the finish wins! But in MALU, you will need to muster all your skill and cunning to make it past your opponent and be the first across the mountain pass.&#10;&#10;"

These creatures defy accurate description, view people as mere insects, and can drive you out of your mind (sometimes literally) simply by standing before you.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by any number of players; either solo, same side, or head to head.&#10;&#10;In Lovecraft's Revenge, players control one or more characters in an rpg-like Lovecraftian adventure. Each adventure has a goal and the goal is attained by collecting clues and managing to survive the ordeal with mind and body intact. The game unfolds through a number of scenes at various general locations. Each location will likely have some kind of encounter. Some encounters will surely be of a combat nature, but others might involve solving puzzles or interacting with npc's within the adventure.&#10;&#10;"

And he&rsquo;s more than eager to help!  Reports say the eccentric businessman, an avid plane enthusiast, is secretly devoting his substantial financial resources to build a fleet of flying machines that surpasses all others.  But does he work for the glory of king and country?  Or to line his own pockets?  No one knows.&#10;&#10;The schemes of past Knickernacker patriarchs are legendary, and Master Pennington is as peculiar as his predecessors.  But he keeps his cards close to the vest.

If the party defeats the boss, they win, and gain an Epic Treasure Card. Otherwise, they die and lose the game.&#10;&#10;The objective of the Solo version of the game is to accomplish your character's End Goal before s/he becomes too cowardly, despairing, mad, reviled, or too dead to continue adventuring.&#10;&#10;Different End Goals include: Becoming Accomplished (in a certain discipline or skill), becoming Powerful, being Revered as a god, becoming Renowned (for performing feats), or by attaining great Wealth.&#10;&#10;To accomplish the End Goal, the adventurer travels from Location Card to Location Card.&#10;&#10;When the adventurer enters a Location, s/he can do one of four things: Make Camp (to hunt and rest), Interact with the displayed NPC, do Trade (rolling on a table), or Explore the Location.&#10;&#10;To explore, the Location Card is flipped over, revealing an Encounter. Encounters represent monsters, traps, or perilous situations that must be defeated. Successfully defeating these encounters results in gaining XP and Treasure Cards.&#10;&#10;The XP can be used to eventually gain up to three Levels. Each new level has three Skill Cards you can choose from. You place the acquired Skill Card below your Adventurer Card.&#10;&#10;Each Encounter displays from one to three Impact Icons, which signify how dangerous, horrifying, and taxing the encounter is to resolve. Unless the adventurer immediately avoids (or escapes) the encounter, s/he will be impacted by interacting with it.&#10;&#10;The Encounter Impact will add to the character's Personality, which in turn, affects how effective s/he will be during subsequent encounters.&#10;&#10;In addition to encounter impacts, there are Event Cards that come into play for different durations that also display Impact Icons on them.&#10;&#10;Whenever conditions in play match those specified on active Event Cards, the event impacts the adventurer. The Event Card is then placed under the Adventurer Card, with the Event Card's bottom section visible from the appropriate side of the Adventurer Card.&#10;&#10;A possible outcome of the event is that the character becomes mentally afflicted, emotionally disturbed, or physically maimed.&#10;Thus, as the adventure continues, the character may become too emotionally, psychologically, or physically weak to continue to pursue his or her End Goal. In this case, the adventurer loses the game.&#10;&#10;Conversely, the adventurer wins the game by enduring encounters and events (some of which are positive), and by attaining his or her End Goal.&#10;&#10;Each End Goal lists varying levels of success, so you always try to score higher in subsequent gaming sessions.&#10;&#10;"

Otherwise, bad things may happen. For example, if your morale is low, your players may get suspended more often. After planning your actions, you choose tactics, select your team and play the match. If your form is high, you may end up high in the league. But bigger clubs will be intested in your players more often. Can you convince them to stay?

Each hero has their own character, and they control this character by spending energy to perform actions (such as Melee and Ranged attacks, defusing bombs...) recovering more or less energy at the beginning of their turn depending on their stance. If the hero gets damaged, energy moves to a wound area, and if they lose all of their energy, then they're out of action for a while to recover their strength. Each hero has differing strengths for their abilities, and these strengths are represented by colored dice with different values; the more energy a hero spends on an ability, the more dice of that color they can roll.&#10;&#10;The villain controls a team of henchmen and iconic villains of the Batman universe, and these characters are represented by tiles on their command board, with the characters costing 1, 2, 3, etc. energy to activate as you move left to right down the line.

These conflicts may be as serious as a disagreement on a property line or as trivial as to who makes the best mushroom stew. In any case, Wunder Garten has been the go-to game of gloating for gnomes for as long as one can remember.&#10;&#10;Wunder Garten is a trick-taking game that uses set-collection for scoring. Essentially players take on the role of a gnome attempting to make the most glorious garden of all. You can score points in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;1) Bidding. Before a round begins each player must bid, using elderberry tokens, to determine how many tricks they think they will win. If a player guesses exactly the number of tricks, they will gain 3 points. If they under-bid, they lose 1 point for each bid they are off. If they fail to reach their bid, they gain ZERO points!&#10;&#10;2) When you win a trick you may choose to keep either the winning card or a card from the meadow (community pool) to add to your personal garden (tableau). The player with the most total points in their garden at the end of the round gains 2 points.&#10;&#10;3) There are up to 5 suits being used during play. The lower the value of the card, the more fruit it produces. This rewards players for winning tricks with lower-valued cards because another way to score points is to collect the majority of each suit type. For each majority you have the highest sum in, you gain a bonus point.&#10;&#10;4) Finally, a player may gain an additional bonus point for collecting a card from each different suit into their personal garden.&#10;&#10;There are other strategic choices to be made as well. When to use a Raven Card is important as it allows you to take two cards into your garden instead of one.&#10;&#10;Before bidding takes place, each player must draft a suit to become their trump suit. Once a player has their cards in hand, and have examined them, they must choose a suit that will be most advantageous for them in that round. The suit become their personal trump suit, meaning that if they cannot follow suit during play, they can trump using any card from their chosen suit. No two players can have the same trump suit, making the game both entertaining and balanced.&#10;&#10;"

A special characteristic of this game is that two cards can be combined into a single double-faced card.&#10;&#10;Players should initially be given 2 cards of each of the 9 types for a total of 18 cards. Each player should then proceed to freely combine two differing type cards, back-to-back, to create a total of 9 double-faced cards.&#10;&#10;Every card has three suits (Power, Speed, or Brain). The suit that wins or loses the current trick is decided at the exact moment the first player or the winner of the previous trick plays a card. Once the suit has been decided, the card of that suit with the highest value wins the trick.&#10;&#10;If there is a tie, all cards with the same highest value are flipped face down and the next highest value is calculated again from the remaining cards in play for the trick. If all players have the same value and the tie cannot be broken, no player is declared as winner for that trick.&#10;&#10;The winner of the trick claims the points that were decided at the beginning of the game for each trick. All players, excluding the winner of the trick, may choose to turn over one card in their hand (which gives them a better chance to strategize in secret against their opponents).&#10;&#10;Repeat for a total of 9 tricks. At the end, the person with the greatest amount of points is the winner.&#10;&#10;A second edition &#232;&#188;&#157;&#233;&#135;&#157;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#231;&#183;&#168; (Kishinjou edition) was released in 2016, with a new set of cards.

The former NATO group, now known as the Rogue Army, face the Cyborg Uprising in a thrilling 3D competitive tactical board game series. Also play as the Techno-Communists, the Zero-G Mafia, the Corporates or the Settlers.&#10;&#10;This is a biopunk cyber-tactical military board-game. At the dawn of the 22nd century the ambush assault at the hands of the Machine Communists destroyed much of the planet Earth. NATO and others hold on to honour while others like the Zero-G Mafia and Corporates do it for cash. The Settlers, Martians and other Solar communities fend for their land titles and spatial positions.&#10;&#10;This game features cutting-edge game technology like layered board modules, dry erase record keeping, character units and multi-theatre elements. Fight it out in orbit while waging a ground campaign at the same time. Large Junkspace orbital cities are often the battleground depicted by map-tile layers that players can record damage, fuel and ammunition supplies on. Virtually any hotspot in Sol system will be supported with full mapping and engineering information; in-game attributes provided on the boards.&#10;&#10;Typically a Blak Dragon mission has players' fielding a capitol vessel, with garrisons and hangers bays, against each-other. Players field these capitol ships complete with square 3D map-boards that depict the vessels deck plan and attributes on cards provided (attributes like space travel movement). Also, capitol vessels are represented by a large unit piece on hexagonal map-boards that has three layers that allow three-dimensional fighting in outer space. A vessel's action is planned three moves ahead with secret Command and Network cards being played face down. The vessel's movement, weapons, and network abilities are declared this way. Players will have to guess ahead to what their opponents Commands will be, simulating slow-acting-commands and fog-of-war. Network digital hacks can be assisted by netrunners deployed along with other space infantry units in boarding parties.&#10;&#10;ALL vessels from capitol ships to fighter craft are combined with dry erase playing card markers. Fuel, ammo and air are recorded and spendable. Fighters, gunships, mecha, all can move on the main board.&#10;&#10;Genre conflict elements include nuclear weapons, cluster missile pods, recoiless A.I. automatics, lasers and hand-to-hand blade and martial arts. Fighter-craft, robotic weapon systems, gunships and stealth units are deployable. Send fighter craft, gunships and mecha to assault enemy vessels in zero gravity space and wage infantry battles with your boarding parties. Die rolling and skill attributes compared with die-rolling, armor and dodge determine damage and or loss of units.&#10;&#10;Also, the Uplift Community, everyone from the Dolphins to the Dawgs, will be represented. Dolphin Settlers have a stake-hold on Mars with their backs to the Earth investment, now vital. Dawg mercenary  infantry companies  are deployed across theatre. The space breather group once known as shipbuilders rebel at lost fees and exile and are now called the &quot;Zero-G Mafia&quot;. Cockroachers stake-held Saturn as well having better fared the scourge of stolen ships.&#10;&#10;Characters exist in Blak Dragon with special abilities and strengths. You will recognize them from the novel Blak Dragon released in 2013.&#10;&#10;Look forward to more incredible news about the Blak Dragon Era in the &quot;Infantry&quot; expandable hybrid media universe soon.&#10;&#10;"

In The Third Law you are one with the machine, riding the grid, dealing and receiving life-threatening feedback as you strive to cripple your opponents' mind. Control the Nodes or annihilate their Wreckers; either way only one Machinist will walk away with the prize.&#10;&#10;With a dynamically shifting battlefield and an unparalleled level of immersion, The Third Law marks a new peak in skirmish level, miniatures wargames. Constant interaction between players anchors a fluid combat system; subroutines are assigned and executed in devastating assaults. Unleash your custom code as lethal programs drive your Wreckers onward in a brutal frenzy of destruction.&#10;&#10;There are 4 initial factions in The Third Law, each with their own back-story, motivations, look and play style.  With in-faction options for Machinists, Wreckers and upgrades, each Array selected will be unique to you and the strategy you determine.&#10;&#10;The Third Law is a skirmish level, sci-fi miniatures wargame where players take on the role of a 'Machinist'; selecting and controlling their Wrecker Arrays to do battle against rival factions in a dark, near future world.&#10;&#10;Starting with your choice of Machinist, you will select, upgrade and control a small team of robotic combatants (Wreckers) in tabletop combat.  Your ultimate goal is to inflict enough feedback damage to the opposing Machinist (while minimising the feedback you endure) to ensure that it is them and not you that is removed from the battleground in a comatose state.&#10;&#10;You can inflict feedback in a myriad of ways but most commonly damage to a Machinist is done through the temporary loss of a Wrecker, through The Grid itself (by controlling the strategically significant 'Nodes') or through direct Machinist attacks.  Depending on the faction you chose, you will discover a wide range of options and specialisms that can help you emerge victorious.&#10;&#10;With its innovative 'subroutine' resource allocation system, The Third Law is an unparalled tactical challenge for even veteran gamers.  Your choice of Machinist, Wreckers and upgrades will determine the type and quantity of resources available to you in battle.  With each Wrecker making a contribution to the global subroutine pool you begin defining your strategy as you select your Array.&#10;&#10;Futher strategic depth is delivered through an ever changing battlefield; as Nodes change hands new fronts open up and astute Machinists can take advantage of the ebb and flow of power across The Grid to inflict further punishment on their opponent.  It may not be enough simply to dominate by weight of metal, often victory is seized by those who can best control the currents of energy and create crippling waves of feedback.  By using your Wreckers to secure and hold Nodes deep in enemy territory you can ensure the safety of your neural pathways while inflicting untold damage on the mental capacity of your foe.&#10;&#10;Finally, as the controlling Machinist you are able to bring your own range of special abilities to bear on the outcome of the battle.  With each Machinist equipped with their own custom code you can take advantage of more efficient programmes to drive your Wreckers.  Depending on your class you may find yourself able to support your Wreckers with more effective subroutines or cripple your enemies with devastating viral strikes.  Whoever you chose to play as, you can create a bespoke package of abilities that reflect your playstyle and tactical preferences.&#10;&#10;"

They must use a car until it has parked and then they can use their second car, and so on. First to park all 4 of their cars, wins.&#10;&#10;Roll the number die to move your car. You can go in any direction. A parking space must be reached exactly. When you park a car you must roll the number die again together with the letter die (this is called &quot;paying the parking metre&quot;). The throw will probably refer to a parking space somewhere on the board, the number die reveals the area and the letter die reveals the actual parking place in that area. Any car in that space must be moved back to the start. Should a blank be rolled on the letter die any cars in the parking places must 'feed the meter again' i.e. roll the number and letter dice again.&#10;&#10;The game is undated but an educated guess would be around 1960. Interestingly, even with fewer people around, it was still difficult to find a parking space!&#10;&#10;"

Invent crazy adventures by picking random tokens and contest your opponents&rsquo; stories to make fun of their heroes!&#10;&#10;At the start of a game, each players are given 2 origins and 2 superpowers. They each choose a combo of 1 origin, and 1 superpower.  They then one by one present their superhero to the other players by name, origin and superpower. It can either be very detailed, or simply naming the cards. This gives a feel about the game to new players.&#10;&#10;Then supervillains are displayed face up on the table. On his turn, a player chooses a supervillain, and starts telling the story of how his superhero stopped him from accomplishing one of the two machiavellic plans displayed on the supervillain card.&#10;He puts his hands in the tokens bag, and pulls out randomly a number of tokens equal to the supervillain difficulty level. (1 to 3) and throws them on the table and turns the hourglass.  These token have random pictures on them, and the player must tell the story of how his superheroe stopped the supervillain mentionning his superpower, and his story must include all the randomly selected tokens. Other players may play one of their special tokens to add an additionnal random token to the story if they feel it's going to be too easy, and after the player finishes his story, they can also play special token to contest his story by either telling that it's the other players superhero who really did the job, and that this players version was not the truth, or that the superhero was beated by the supervillain and lost his encounter. To do so, they turn over the tokens to reveal new pictures, and tell their stories.&#10;&#10;After that, player vote for the best story, and the winning player gets the supervillain card.  If the supervillain won, the cards goes back at the center of the table, and is available to be picked again by the players.&#10;&#10;Once a player has gathered a given number of supervillains (depending on the number of players), he picks 3 cards from the retirement deck, and chooses one to play with one last story with the same rules above, but adding how this adventure ended his life a sa super hero and went into retirement.&#10;&#10;Once a player retires, every other players also tell one last story the same way, then we count the difficulty values of the supervillains taken by each players.
