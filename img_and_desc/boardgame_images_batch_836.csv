The new offensive would again be spearheaded by the International Brigades by the Army of the East. The goal was to break through the Nationalist lines and take the key city of Zaragosa. Success here would compel the Nationalists to withdraw, bringing relief to the city of Madrid and demonstrating the Republican cause could still win the civil war. The Nationalists had stripped this portion of the front of troops, with only three divisions holding the line. Despite their superiority in men and tanks, as well as the commitment of nearly all of the Republican air force to the offensive, the Nationalists grimly held to their positions and were able to disrupt the Republican attack. The fighting was particularly hard at Belchite, where fighting degenerated into a house-to-house slugfest that left the city in ruins. By the start of September the Nationalists had brought up reinforcements and gained air superiority. However, the Republican&rsquo;s determination managed to hold off the Nationalist counter-offensive, and by the 6th a stalemate in the war returned here.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?&#10;&#10;Each copy of Courageous Tragedy is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;&bull;    Two 11 by 17 hex map sheets&#10;&bull;    81 un-mounted, double-sided counters&#10;&bull;    8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;As with the other Battles of the Spanish Civil War Series (on Teruel and Brunete), players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and determine some game events.

Some dice results provide movement, while others allow you mark rows or columns and drop new gems onto the board.&#10;&#10;Once the turn order, a.k.a. the Pecking Order, has been established, players will then execute actions one at a time. Players can move their chickens 1-3 spaces depending on the dice spent and possibly shove an opponent's hen out of the way. If a chicken lands on a Grain Gem, a player can place it on their Egg Board. Some Grain Gems are rarer than others. They score positive points if they are part of completed sets on the facet of the jeweled egg and negative points if that facet is incomplete or the gem is unused.&#10;&#10;The advanced variant of Gem Hens adds Power Clucks, powerful abilities for your chickens that make the battle for precious Grain Gems even more chaotic.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Volksgrenadier Division, reinforced by the Panzer Lehr Division. Defending was part of the 110th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division. It should have been a blitzkrieg through the thin defenses but stubborn resistance, the terrain, and the well-managed commitment of American reinforcements caused the German attack to fail to take Bastogne just as the 101st Airborne Division arrived.

Its cost of operations is too high, its revenue too low. In a last ditch attempt, it is looking to hire a top tier business consultant to turn this around. Alas, there are many such persons claiming to be the best. To filter mere noise from the elite, the company has called upon the consultants with the most potential to share their business proposals - You are one such.&#10;&#10;Shake Up sits in a very rare tabletop genre: reverse deck-building or also known as a deck destruction game. Players each have their own deck of cards, which are completely identical decks since they represent the same employees of the same IT company. How each player handles the company will be different though, and that is where the better consultant will stand out. The first consultant to put the company into the green wins!&#10;&#10;Every turn players draw 4 cards from their own deck, and determine how to utilize those cards' abilities. Players are also allowed to perform a 'Lay Off' action, permanently removing an employee from the deck. While this may seem bad, it makes their deck more efficient in the style they want to build towards. They also save on that employee's salary, especially if it is a highly paid executive! Note however, that the higher ups usually have greater experience and better abilities. Starting off the game with some debt, players will slowly clear them away as well as make some profit through new business projects. How then do consultants interact in the game? Their sales folks can try to hustle the other team, messing up their rivals' business proposals! Of course, those same rivals will likely also have their own purchasing and accounting departments to protect themselves from red herring purchases.&#10;&#10;When does the game end? Each time a player's draw deck is emptied and recycled from its discard pile, she has a chance to call an Audit. When an Audit is called, that player counts her total revenue earned, then reduce it by the salary of all existing employees in her deck, as well as any unpaid loans. If it is still positive, she wins the game right away! Dare you call an Audit before your rival? Doing so is risky, since you either win the game right away or you gain more debt because you have to pay for wasting the auditors' time, putting you further from victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Deck-builders are a common genre and folks try to add more powerful and advanced cards into their deck, which is typically comprised of basic cards. In reverse deck-building however, players begin with fully powered-up decks. The problem is one where veteran deck-builders will be familiar with - having too thick a deck will make it inefficient. Throughout the game, players will try to cull cards that are not part of their chosen strategy.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The main components are 25 plastic sombrero-shaped hats, each concealing a sticker in one of five colours.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, players are dealt a set of hats and three hats are placed on the table. The player in turn to play may conditionally peek at the colour of a lone hat, and must then place one of their hats on one of the three piles, calling out a colour as they do so. Stating a colour is purely psychological though, as the player is only required to match colours with the hat underneath and whatever is said is disregarded entirely when confirming this. It is also possible to pass at the cost of taking a hat from the &quot;deck&quot;.&#10;&#10;Another player may challenge a placement, at which point the newly placed hat and the one underneath are inspected to see if they match. In typical bluffing game fashion, whichever of the challenged and challenging player is in the wrong is penalized by having to pick up the entire pile in question, and the other continues play by beginning a replacement pile.&#10;&#10;The goal of each round is to be the first player to get rid of all hats, at which point the other players get penalty points based on the hats they still hold.
