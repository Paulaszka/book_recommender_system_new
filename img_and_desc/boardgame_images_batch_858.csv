Millions in a bag, fleeing by plane, yes, really, a sound one. Everyone begins to relax, but suddenly the engine sputters! Then the plane begins to fall... Yes, the holdup was perfect and they had anticipated everything &mdash; everything but enough parachutes to go around...&#10;&#10;Play your role amongst ten characters in Bahamas and steal, lie, threaten, do everything you can to get the biggest part of the loot and land safely!&#10;&#10;In more detail, each player receives a character sheet at random (each with a different special power), along with one starting card, one action card, and two cash cards. Among these starting cards are 2-5 parachutes (depending on the number of players), and you'll want one of these to survive at game's end! Use a number of dice equal to the player count minus one. Choose a starting player at random. This player rolls all the dice, uses one of them (drawing an action or cash card, stealing an action or cash card from an opponent, or using their special power), then they choose the next player who will take a turn. Once all the dice have been used, whoever didn't get to use a die becomes the starting player for the next round.&#10;&#10;A &quot;Crash&quot; card is shuffled into the bottom four cards of the action deck, and when it's drawn, everyone without a parachute &mdash; or the lifeboat hiding in the action deck &mdash; plunges to their death. Whichever surviving character has the most money wins! Alternatively, if one player collects the three different FBI cards prior to the crash, this player manages to land the plane safely, bust everyone else, and win!&#10;&#10;"

It may be played on its own or may be combined with The War: Europe 1939-1945 (&ldquo;TWE&rdquo;) to recreate the entire Second World War. In conjunction with The War&rsquo;s Expansion Kit, gamers can now enjoy the complete TW franchise. The game includes TW: Global rules linking the Asia/Pacific and European theaters.&#10;&#10;The War: The Pacific, 1941-1945 borrows many concepts from TWE, so experienced TWE gamers will readily adapt to TWP&rsquo;s game system. However, TWP doesn&rsquo;t just port European Theater rules to the Pacific and hope for the best. The game features sophisticated carrier-warfare rules that capture the unique features of the Allied naval struggle against Japan. Further, TWP isn&rsquo;t just a naval strategy contest. Unlike some WWII strategy games, Nationalist China plays an active role in TWP, and a player&rsquo;s diplomatic strategy in China may be as important as his military strategy.&#10;&#10;As in TWE, there are numerous optional rules and variants, from the Doolittle raid to Japanese Fleet suicide missions. Scenarios include Changsha (Nationalist China vs. Japan, Fall 1939); Guadalcanal; Coral Sea; Midway; the Eastern Solomons; Leyte; Okinawa, 1941-1945 Pacific War Campaign; 1942-1943 Turning Point; and TW-Global, combining TWP and TWE into one monster campaign game.&#10;&#10;Playing times range from less an hour for the smallest scenarios up to 40-50 hours for the full campaign. For those who want to run the full Europe-Pacific campaign, joining both games together, you&rsquo;ll need about 80 hours to recreate all of World War Two.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;&#10;Complexity: High (about 8 out of 10)&#10;    Solitaire Suitability: Good&#10;    Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 months&#10;    Map Scale: 1 hex = 46 miles or 75 km&#10;    Unit Scale: Fleets and Task-Forces; Air: Wings; Land: Divisions, Corps and Army&#10;    Players: two&#10;    Playing Time: 50 hours for full campaign (1.5 hours and up for scenarios)&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
