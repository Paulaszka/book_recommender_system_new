A set of PB consists of 250 flat wooden pieces in geometric shapes: hex, square, parallelogram, triangle, diamond, trapezoid.  The shapes are all the same scale and based on a fundamental angle of 30 degrees - like a super Tangram set.&#10;&#10;The supporting bits include a protractor, a very nice spinner for selecting one of the PB shapes, three d6 (one 'regular', one with the six PB piece colors, and one with angles in 30 degree increments), Tangram and 'mandala' cue cards, and four sturdy game boards.  This equipment (and a PB set) lets you play the five games described in the rules.  The games are a mix of non-competitive pattern-making games, and races to be first to make specific shapes or patterns.  All are well thought out to teach basic geometric principles and/or excite the imagination (as if geometry wasn't exciting enough).&#10;&#10;The pieces are well-made and are totally conducive to creating new games, the spinner and dice especially.  The skills being taught by the five supplied games are grade school level, but as games I think one or two of these could challenge many adults.  I'm tempted to order a PB set just to try some of them - and of course make beautiful designs in my spare time.  Building blocks of any kind are good clean fun.&#10;&#10;"

Battlefield sections are great for ACW and WWII, but spreading a (smaller) imperial force across the battlefield would not always be realistic or playable, since in most colonial battles a smaller well armed imperial army faces hordes of natives. The left-center-right wing Battle Cry/Memoir '44 principle has here been replaced by color-coding the units red, green and blue (activated by cards of the same color) thus enabling the imperialist player to concentrate his units anywhere on the battlefield if he wishes to. Also, compared to ACW or WWII, there was a much bigger difference in quality of weapons used by imperialists and natives. Therefore the symbols on the dice are no longer representing the targets but rather the type of ammo/weapon used, whereby the more modern weapons have a better chance of scoring hits than outdated ones (see rules).&#10;&#10;Since many colonial games are played in &quot;Darkest Africa&quot;, an (optional) set of &quot;event cards&quot; is added in order to spice up the &quot;adventure&quot; type games. When using the fast play variant, games with 20-30 native units (and about half of that number of imperial forces) can be concluded in 90-120 minutes (ideal for a club night). In order to have a balanced game, the number of victory points to be scored by imperialist armies should be around 1.5 times higher than for native forces.&#10;&#10;"

While little is taught in today's classrooms about the war, this modern day David and Goliath story is still forming the world we live in.&#10;&#10;In May of 1967, after a 10 year buildup of Arab military force in Sinai, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser amassed the armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan on the borders of Israel. By the end of that same month, Egypt engaged in the first official military action of the 6-day war by declaring a naval blockade against the nation of Israel. After concentrating an enormous Arab amphibious assault force just 17km from the coast of Israel, Nasser ominously proclaimed, &quot;The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel...to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations.&quot;&#10;&#10;Echoing these sentiments, the Iraqi President Abdur Rahman Aref boldly declared, &quot;The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy that has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear: 'to wipe Israel off the map'.&quot;&#10;&#10;But Israel refused to go quietly into the night. On June 5th, 1967, the Israeli Air Force launched a pre-emptive attack against Egyptian airfields full of bombers, poised for the assault. One of the shortest, yet most influential wars since World War II had begun in earnest, and almost 40 years later, the world is still sorting out the aftermath.&#10;&#10;"

It came with a fold out board a la Twister, though not as large. There were numbered/colored Glunk cards that were placed around the board in designated outlined locations.&#10;&#10;I only remember it being one of those frenetic games, as players raced to grab certain types of cards using the included one foot+ long wands with a suction cup at the end. Many times the suction wasn't strong enough and frustrated players with smash the wand down on the card numerous times until it would adhere. It was a noisy, chaotic affair, and the gimmick wore off quite fast.

There were two sets of cards. Player Cards and Glunk Cards. The Glunk cards were shuffled and placed face down in the middle of a 4' by 4' heavy vinyl sheet. The Player cards were scattered face down around the Glunk cards. Each player would take turns counting 3-2-1 and tuning up a Glunk card and calling the colour of the Glunk pictured. The card would be placed face up on top of the deck.The person turning the card would have to quickly get out of the way as blows would begin raining down as players would try to stick their suction cup tipped Glunk stick to the back of each card in rapid succession, looking for a colour match. No hands allowed, except to replace the non-matching cards face down on the sheet. When a match was found the player would call it, keep the card and claim the Glunk card to form a pair. The winner was the player with the most pairs at the end of play.&#10;&#10;(Note:*My brother's solution to cards not sticking well, was to LICK the suction cup in between cards. I ended up with many bruises resulting from being bashed while playing. The force of the blows was quite something, seeing as the sticks were made of thick, rigid plastic. Within two years all were broken and the vinyl sheet - white when turned over, became my thrifty mother's picnic table cloth.)&#10;&#10;"
