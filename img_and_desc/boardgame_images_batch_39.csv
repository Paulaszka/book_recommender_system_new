4505,,"Not to be confused with divinatory tarot, the game of tarot probably comes from Italy. It is played with a 78-card deck that has 56 suited cards (similar to the 52-card Poker deck, with the addition of a Cavalier or Knight court card between the Jack and Queen in each suit), plus 21 suitless trump cards in ascending rank, and one &quot;Fool&quot;, similar to the Joker but with differing origins.&#10;&#10;In the most popular tarot game, called French Tarot in most English-speaking countries, one of the players will be the taker who will be playing against all the other players. The takers' goal is to make a certain amount of points in order to fulfill the contract which the taker player bids on at the beginning of the game. The goal of the other players (called the defense) is to stop the taker from achieving their score. The defense plays as a team against the taker.&#10;&#10;After receiving their hand, the players will take turns betting on a contract based on whether they think they can achieve the number of points required. The last player to place a bet will become the taker.&#10;&#10;A large number of European card games are played with either the full tarot deck or a subset of it, often re-faced in Germanic or other Eastern European motifs.&#10;&#10;"

This caused the Nucraft game to have a far more limited production and thus their game is far more valuable to collectors today. &#10;&#10;     Not so sure about this interpretation. A note on the rules for&#10;     Nucraft&#039;s game Crash game indicate that Parker Brothers bought&#10;     the rights to the Lindy game from Nucraft. So it would seem&#10;     that Parker bought out Nucraft and shelved their version of&#10;     the game.&#10;&#10;After the lawsuit Nucraft issued a different game called Crash, The New Airplane Game. It seems to be a Parcheesi type game played with three planes per color and a four color spinner.&#10;&#10;Nucraft Toys ended in 1933 when the company started operating under the name of its founder Paul K. Guillow.  The company Paul K. Guillow did not produce any games.&#10;&#10;"

Early iterations of the game included cards with attached objects, and cards of a variety of sizes and shapes within the same deck and gameplay session. Many cards in later decks have a point value, but this is by no means a requirement.&#10;&#10;Cards generally include hand-drawn pictures. The game encourages quick sketches by non-artists, which can add to the overall ironic orientation of the game. Card illustrations can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd. (However, usually cards tend toward the latter.)&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;&#10;Game play conventionally follows a &quot;draw one, play one&quot; rule, with standard rotation; however, this, as with any game parameters, can be arbitrarily altered in play.&#10;&#10;In one variant, blank cards are simply made available to all players at all times, and can be created without limitation and played in turn. In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.&#10;&#10;In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game. In other variants, all cards must be retained and reintroduced, regardless of perceived quality.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Dvorak&#10;    Nomic&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each player has 15 identical pieces that are set up on opposite sides of the board, which is comprised of an 8&times;8 playing field of squares that is further divided diagonally in alternate fashion (see picture). Pieces are comprised of 8 small triangles of various orientation (Auxiliaries), 4 squares (Archers) which are the size of two Auxiliaries, 2 Hoplites (which are the size of an Archer with an Auxiliary on top), and 1 Syntagma, a larger triangle (the size of 2 Auxiliaries combined). Since each piece must always be oriented to face its owner (diagram for set-up is printed on the board), you&rsquo;ll find that some pieces are not interchangeable with others of the same type (like Hoplites and Auxiliaries). This is important as all movement is done by moving pieces diagonally, horizontally, or vertically without rotation along paths that are not blocked and the piece must end on a space where the board outline matches the piece.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to capture or &quot;Phalanx&quot; your opponents pieces&mdash;not by jumping (as in Checkers) or by taking its place on the board (as in Chess), but by surrounding it on two of its sides with your pieces (custodial capture, as in Hnefatafl). A multiple Phalanx attack is possible if a move surrounds several of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces at once. When 14 of a player&rsquo;s 15 pieces are captured, that player can no longer win and is eliminated. Tied or drawn games (you can play to a time limit as well) are determined by the value of each player&rsquo;s remaining pieces, which range between 5 and 20 points each.&#10;&#10;"

A player may also play a subpoena card to look at all the cards in a given players hand or to increase their own hand size. Play continues like this until a player thinks they can solve the mystery. They announce their solution (Who, Motive, How) and then reads (silently) the solution. If correct, they win, if not, they are out of the game and play continues.&#10;&#10;Game is (very slightly) compared to the 'How to Host Your Own Murder' series, in that once the game is played, it cannot be played again by the same players, as there is only one solution.&#10;&#10;The box even references said product, by stating that to play 'Dealing with Murder', you don't need to cook a dinner or show up wearing a costume to play.&#10;&#10;"

In the initial phase of the game, players place these tiles on the table (there is no board) in one connected group, but are not allowed to connect more than 5 of their color together.  Once all tiles are placed, a turn generally consists of exchanging the positions of any two tiles.  The object is to unify all of one's own tiles into the same country (connected group).  The King protects the tiles in its group (another player can only remove one by swapping it with his or her own King), but can only be moved once for free - after that a penalty must be paid.  The Warrior offers additional movement abilities.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published in 1975 under the name Kingdoms.  The version shown, titled The Game of Ancient Kingdoms, was published in 1976.  The rules are nearly identical, with the later version adding the penalty rule for moving the King and a rule for scoring draw games.&#10;&#10;"
