The maps are 21&quot; x 27&quot; and there are two Pacific and two Atlantic maps with a total of 39 areas.&#10;&#10;As a standalone game, The Two Ocean War allows double-blind player movement via two copies of the Atlantic and Pacific theater maps. During the movement phase, players place their fleets on their own game boards, unaware of the other player's moves. Once moves are completed, both players go area by area on both maps, resolving battles between fleets placed in the same areas on the two different maps and to resolve combat and determine victory points awarded for each sea zone. Combat is similar to the Avalon Hill sea games, using six-sided dice. Rolls of 1-4 are no effect, 5 is a disable (ship returns to port), 6 is a hit causing a subsequent die roll for amount of damage.&#10;&#10;The game is superior to the Avalon Hill sea games in some regards. Highlights include larger fleets (CL-class ships for all nations are represented in addition to the other ship classes in the AH games), more sea zones, and the blind movement resulting in often surprising battle lineups in particular sea zones. Additional rules let small ships torpedo big ones under certain conditions, and since the game represents fleets worldwide, there are opportunities for some Axis ships to change theaters just as the Allied ships can.&#10;&#10;"

The gameboard has a series of turntables on it, which can be rotated so as to alter the paths in front of the players: the skillful manipulation of the turntables lies at the heart of the game. Each turn the player's piece (a small racing car) moves 1,2,3, or 4 squares forwards, at the player's discretion. If he lands on a space with black dots, he can rotate a turntable anywhere on the board, either to clear his path to the finish line or to hinder someone else. The Finish squares when reached give you points, and then you return to the start, only winning when you have 100 pts. It is possible to become completely trapped in an area with no black dots, and this carries a penalty of 20 pts and return to start. &#10;The theme is pasted on, but the deduction and 'screwage factor' involved should appeal to many.&#10;&#10;"
