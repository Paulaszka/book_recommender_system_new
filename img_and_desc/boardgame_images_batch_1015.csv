Everyone raises a finger, and on the count of three, you point at someone who seems like a good fit. (In a three-player game, you might be alone, and if you think you are, you point at yourself.) Everyone then reveals their squad affiliation, and if you guessed correctly, you score points; you also score if someone correctly identified you as being part of their squad.&#10;&#10;You then reshuffle the squad cards and play another round. Whoever has the most points after three rounds wins.&#10;&#10;This is an English-language update of the German game #no secrets.&#10;&#10;"
