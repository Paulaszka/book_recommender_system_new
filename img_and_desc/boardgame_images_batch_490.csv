Each round consists of two phases: (1) drawing and placing action counters and (2) performing actions. In the first phase, all players draw six action counters from the bag, then place them on their individual playing panels. Most action counters show both a resource (five types possible) and a person (four types), while managers are on counters of their own. Each playing panel has columns for the five types of resources and the five types of workers, with space for two counters in each column. Players can also allocate counters to the &quot;research facility&quot; below their panel.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, players take actions one at a time until everyone has no actions remaining or passes. A resource or worker action can be taken only if both spaces are filled in the appropriate column; when a player takes an action, he removes all action counters in the column, returns them to the bag, then takes the action.&#10;&#10;&bull; The &quot;research facility&quot; action must be carried out first, with the player taking the designated resources from the supply and placing one resource in any location that doesn't already have that resource available.&#10;&#10;&bull; The worker actions allow a player to place a salesman in a stock exchange, place a worker in Vladivostok, move workers up to three spaces, move a manager to any action space, or claim an investment tile; each investment tile corresponds to a particular resource or worker action and is placed on the player panel permanently, allowing the player to take this action more easily in the future since the column is always half-filled.&#10;&#10;&bull; Each resource action allows a player to remove that resource from all areas where he has a worker, then immediately sell them on one of the stock exchanges where he has a salesman.&#10;&#10;A player can keep up to ten action counters on his playing panel at the end of a round, allowing him to prepare for and build up actions for future rounds. The game ends at the end of any round in which three of the five resources have no supply remaining or eight areas have had all their resources removed. (Once an area is exhausted, nothing can be placed in it for the remainder of the game.) The player who has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;"

Though relatively unknown, these conflicts, raging from 1739-1748, comprised the first &quot;world war&quot;. The primary naval actions took place in three theatres: the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, the Caribbean, and the western Mediterranean. Forces also clashed in India, along America's eastern seaboard, and in the Pacific. Each of the other games covers one of these theatres. Mistral covers the western Mediterranean, where Spain tried to keep her lines of communication open to her army in Italy, and France's Toulon Fleet continually harassed the British.&#10;&#10;Mistral is a two player strategy game. You command either the British or Bourbon (French and Spanish) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points), and may even have an impact on the land campaign. You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organising your &quot;sail&quot; (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at &quot;battle readiness&quot; is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters in play is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players.

The discovery of gold, in one valley by the river in today&rsquo;s Yukon in Canada, had started the greatest gold rush ever related to Alaska wild-west. Get there as one of two to four gold- miners and experience one of two possible game variants this title offers. Each variant, based on different principles, stands as a complete game and offers a different gaming encounter&hellip;&#10;In the first game variant each gold-digger is in a search for the best parcels in his landscape to claim them for treasures to be gained. Golden nuggets bring victory points and rubies are to be possibly spent as resources for claim tokens in random and limited offer. In an auction player can smart out the others for strategic claim tokens or bluff them out of rubies as well. .. in other words checking on others might work a bit too! &#10;The first player, in a round based flow, who manages to dig through to the other end of his landscape, presented by four boards in a row, closes the game. However the winner is the richest gold-digger, a player with the most collected golden nuggets after the final VP count with possible penalties. &#10;The strategy and tactical decisions are made upon open information only.  The depth of pre-planning can lead to overwhelming dimension as well as it can be taken as a no rush family friendly play-style.&#10;&#10;The second game variant offers exploding fun and whole different player&rsquo;s interaction. Being quick and cool headed, knowing a landscape to claim is a sure way, still outsmarting or bluffing the others might help in some cases! &#10;Winner is an experienced and ambitious gold-beater with the most popularity points for a council seat. Popularity is in relation to four down-town VIPs such as brothel madam, sheriff, mayor and horse trader. Each round player has a set of 10 unique tetris shape claim tokens to place them onto his set of four landscape boards. This happens in a race that starts with uncovering a random request card for this turn.&#10; The only closed information is the one before the moment of truth, when the picky requests of celebrities shall be satisfied. How well did you dig for them? Your popularity in four tracks may rise as well as it can fall by not following the exactions for gold and rubies.&#10;&#10;Via the title Klondike 1896 players are looping back in time to meet one of the earliest and never before published creations of Vladim&iacute;r Such&yacute; presented by StragooGames (SGG).&#10;&#10;"

Totality is a unique board game that combines the features of a card game with the mechanisms of a board game; it plays in the current era and simulates the total range of the human condition. The heart of the game is the deck of 64 unique and intriguing cards.  There are 4 suits of 16 cards.  These suits represent the 4 planes of existence - physical,  biological, cognitive, and social.  Each plane (suit) has 4 unique elements and a color.  Each card in the suit is composed of a combination of those four elements.  Cards have a number of elements from zero to four.   The mix of elements is shown on each card.  Each card has a game action line.  The game area (world) consists of a 4X4  array of cards laid face up and a space in front of each player to keep sets and action cards.  Players move through the world to gather cards.  Each player is represented by a marker or token.&#10;&#10;Object of the game: to build the character with the most experience by gathering sets of cards while moving around the board (world).&#10;&#10;Setup.  1)  Shuffle the deck; 2) Deal one card to each player.  The player with the highest card number goes first.  Players keep this card as part of their hand; 3) Then deal the 4X4 world face down.  Before play begins, each player, starting with the first, places his token in the world on a different location.  After the tokens are played, the location cards are turned face up; 4)  Deal 2 more cards to each player for a total of 3. The rest of the deck is placed face down as the draw deck (DD); place it so that the longer side of the cards is next to the world; 5) A discard (recycle) heap (DH) will be created during play; place it so that the shorter side of the cards is next to the world.  Cards are discarded face down.&#10;&#10;Play.  Each turn consists of just one of the following actions unless there are effects in play that allow more: 1) Activate or remove a special effect.  The game line of most cards can create effects that change the play.  2) Move.  Movement is in a vertical or horizontal direction only (like a rook in chess).   At the beginning of the game, players can move one location per turn.  3) Gather a card from the world.  Players may gather the card under their token. 4)  Build or dismantle a set.  This is the heart of the game.  A player grows by playing sets in his character area.  Sets consist of one or more cards that satisfy specific criteria from set theory.  5.  Combat.  Combat may occur when a player (attacker) tries to move to or through a site occupied by other players (defenders), or attacks players at his current location. Combat involves betting; outcomes are governed by a simple table.  6) Open a trading session. Any player may  open a trading session his turn. Anything may be traded: token locations, sets, cards, seats, drinks.  There are two ways to end the game.  A player may end the game when he has sets with all 16 elements of the deck present.  Otherwise, the game ends instantly when the draw deck is depleted for the first time.&#10;&#10;"

Players are awarded a maximum 100 points for landing either on London or on the home base of the British fleet at Scapa Flow. Other cities and shipping targets are worth between 20 and 70 points. The game was clearly published during the &quot;Phony War&quot; period of late 1939/early 1940, since Calais in France is also worth 100 points, but neutral Amsterdam and Brussels score -80 points each (and hitting Germany is -100).&#10;&#10;As with many games published during the Nazi regime, it was pure propaganda intended to focus players on supporting the war.&#10;&#10;"

It is a trivia game with set collection and negotiation elements&#10;&#10;The players' goal is to make and publish movies. Movies are made by collecting a set of matching Actors, Title, Director and Producer cards as well as enough money to produce the movie. Money and cards are collected by moving on the gameboard and answering movie-related questions. A player can only have one card of each type in hand, so if additional cards are collected (for example a second Director card), they can be either discarded or traded with the other players.&#10;&#10;Movement on the board uses a roll-and-move mechanic, with a few tweaks, like no &quot;reroll&quot; spaces, and several spaces allow the player to move her game piece anywhere she wants on the board. At first players only have access to the board spaces that allow them to collect cards or money (provided they correctly answer a question). Once a player has at least produced at least one movie, she gains access to all of the gameboard, including spaces which allow players to collect cash from their produced movies.&#10;&#10;Once a player has made more movies than other competitors, she can win the game by going to the &quot;Palme d'Or&quot; space and answering a special question.

The consequences of wild nightlife, sloth and other sins are barely balanced by the occasional burst of sport activity and more-or-less random jabs at a healthy lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Sound familiar? No, we are not talking about your life, but about what you are up against in Infarkt (&quot;Heart Attack&quot;), a party game in which you want to be the last one left at the party &ndash; literally.&#10;&#10;Each player has an individual player board on which she'll track her blood pressure, depression, lung health, weight and so on. Everyone starts out as healthy as possible, with some money ($1) in the pocket, too. Each round, a number of event cards equal to one more than the number of players is revealed. In turn, each player will choose an event card and suffer the effects of that card, moving her health indicators as needed. Did you run out of gas? Or have a bout of diarrhea? Man, life sucks.&#10;&#10;Players then simultaneously deploy three action markers to indicate where they plan to go that day: the supermarket, the office, a pharmacy, a flea market, the gym, and so on. In turn order, players then execute all three of their actions in whatever order they desire. Maybe you'll hit the office to earn money, but at the cost of having your depression grow more intense. A trip to the supermarket will let you buy food, which you can then eat later at home or give to your neighbors who come to the party you throw. Force them to eat cake and get fat! If you have extra money on hand, you might want to visit the pharmacy to buy drugs; you never know what the pharmacist will give you, but if you don't like it (or the food you've acquired), you can hit the flea market to swap food and drugs &ndash; and maybe pick up some change in the bargain.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, you check your health levels to see whether your body is deteriorating without you even knowing. Get too depressed, for example, and the depression only gets worse; high blood pressure can affect your blood cholesterol level, and vice versa. If a health indicator rises to the tombstone at the top of the column, you've partied your last and are now out of the game. (Everyone else has to chip in for the funeral, suffering depression if they can't afford to pony up for a decent burial for a good friend like you.)
