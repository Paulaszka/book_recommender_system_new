There are also two six-sided dice: one has the numbers, 1 to 6, the other has special symbols.&#10;&#10;The 61 dominoes are dealt out evenly to all players (up to four) and the remaining card is placed face up in the middle. Players then try to lay dominoes down by matching them with the ends of the domino line on the table (like conventional domino games). Squares match if their content are related (e.g. the number of the commandment will match the actual words of the commandment). Any player can challenge a match, whereupon the person laying the domino &quot;must explain himself with proofs from the bible or they can seek an outside moderator&quot;.&#10;&#10;After making a match, the player rolls both dice to determine who will play next (based on the number rolled and the symbol that comes up).&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to finish all his or her cards.&#10;&#10;"

However, it is a very hard task: the dangers lie not only in the natural catastrophes caused by the troubled matter of the Earth, but also in the insanity of people trying to deal with the coming of the apocalypse, in the rivalry of others who have the same goal in mind and in the appearance of supernatural events and creatures that have only lived in people&rsquo;s imagination before. During their adventures the characters will probably travel around the world, visit exotic places, lead expeditions into relentless wildernesses in search for helpful minor Artifacts, face surprising Adventures and venture into disaster-ridden places all other people are running away from.&#10;&#10;Card traits and game mechanics (such as Character Personalities that affect the outcome of adventures they have) all strive to keep the game as thematic as possible, while being simple and straight-forward at the same time. The game tries to keep a short playing time for an adventure game, while still being epic and memorable.&#10;&#10;The game has been influenced by many sources ranging from Indiana Jones (regarding exploration in exotic places) and James Bond movies (high tech gear, daring action scenes), through the Supernatural tv-series (with the &ldquo;ongoing apocalypse&rdquo; setting), Hellblazer comics (giving it the darker tone, people with mystical powers, occult and magic), to the Stalker concept by the Strugatsky-brothers (regarding the whole weird zone called the Unknown, where the rumored relic lies). The mood of the game may feel like a mix of all of the above: quite dark and mature, but without resorting to graphic violence or vulgarity; a bit thought-provoking, but not taking itself too seriously.&#10;&#10;The game uses lots of cards &ndash; around 350 in all &ndash; and many tokens as components, aside from a game board.&#10;&#10;"

It also exist in a tabletop version aimed at dinner parties. On its surface, Sixteen Tons looks like a large-scale boardgame, in which players move very heavy pieces around a four-by-four grid, trying to maneuver their pieces into a winning position. The winniong position is pre the player to get her/his two game pieces orthogonally adjacent. This core gameplay is complicated by the fact that players can pay each other with real money. At the start of the game, each player takes out three one-dollar bills and this money is used to pay other players to move your pieces for you. Playing the game becomes an experience that critically blurs work and play, as the real value of money is grafted onto the artificial meanings of the game, and player identitiy shifts fluidly back and forth from cooperation to competition. Winning the game requires both strategic thinking and social smarts and the rules are intentionally ambiguous about whether players keep each others&rsquo; money after a game. Sixteen Tons is named after the folk song made famous in 1955 by Tennessee Ernie Ford about coal mining and debt bondage.&#10;&#10;In Sixteen Tons, four players play a strategy game using heavy sections of steel pipe as the pieces of the game. At the beginning of the game, players take out three dollar bills from their wallets. This money is used to pay other players to move your pieces for you during the game. The play of Sixteen Tons combines strategic with social thinking. The strategy game is simple to solve &ndash; but the socal game is impossible to predict.&#10;&#10;The rules are ambiguous about what to do with the money in hand at the end of the game. Some players return the three dollars back to their owners. Other players decide to play for keeps &ndash; or even increase the stakes and play with bigger bills.&#10;&#10;"

This game is complete and includes Basic Game Rules, Advanced Game Rules, over two dozen Alphabetized Scenarios, dozens of paper miniatures and markers.  The game is offered as a downloadable PDF file. &#10;As first glance Lurch! is a fairly simple game &ndash; ironically more so than mainstream chess &ndash; as all of the zombies (playing pieces) are identical, and each piece can only undertake one of four possible moves (though you can move up to three pieces per turn). There is a way to make your basic zombie into a clever zombie, which is the equivalent of getting a pawn turned into a queen, but that&rsquo;s about it&hellip;except there's more.&#10;&#10;If the above sounds simple, then rest assured that it is, but that&rsquo;s also just the foundation of the game. The beauty of Lurch! is that it&rsquo;s highly customizable, so much so that the book not only presents three different advanced rules, but also twenty-six &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo; each of which are also variant ways to play.&#10;&#10;"

It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.&#10;&#10;In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.&#10;&#10;Here's the flavour text from the rules:&#10;&#10;The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...&#10;&#10;&#10;The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.&#10;&#10;Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.&#10;&#10;Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...&#10;&#10;"

It is structured to encompass the essential elements of behavior modification and designed to have the greatest positive impact on attention.  In behavior modification children receive specific positive reinforcement for accomplishing a task within an appropriate time frame and without being distracted.  The rewards are usually in the form of tokens.  This game provides two ways for players to win tokens &ndash; with or without a distraction.&#10;&#10;The game has 3 sets of task cards that describe tasks that the players have to complete in order to earn their tokens.  Each task requires concentration and continuing attention and includes:&#10;&#10;1.  Categories:  Players have to list things that belong in a specific category, such as listing five fruits that have one large pit in the middle.&#10;&#10;2.  Forward and Back:  Players have to recite things forward and/or backwards, such as reciting the alphabet forwards and backwards from A to F.&#10;&#10;3.  Problem Solving:  The game comes with various cut out shapes and cut out words.  Using shapes, the players have to create a specific design, like a triangle similar to the pattern on the card, using the shapes provided.  Using words the players have to create a sentence, like a sentence in which someone throws something to someone else.&#10;&#10;A player can elect to perform the task without distraction and win one token or with distraction and win two tokens.  The distraction is optional.  The distractions are provided by one of the other players, who pick a Distraction card.  This card may ask the distracting player to hum &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; or tap fingers on the table while the other player is trying to accomplish the task.  Players can earn more tokens when they attempt a task while distracting events are taking place.  Distractions are the most common reason people lose focus on the task at hand.  This game gives players much needed practice that improves their ability to stay focused on tasks, even with distractions.&#10;&#10;There are both competitive and cooperative versions for grades 1-12.  There are three decks of Task cards with varied levels of difficulty: easier, regular, and challenge.  The key is for the players to be able to complete the task most of the time if they concentrate and are not distracted.

Bullies to Buddies is an educational game that deals with the complex nature of bullying in a way that elementary school students can understand and learn specific skills. Players learn that all students must take a stand against bullying. For example, the target (intended victim) can use assertiveness skills to discourage bullying. If bystanders are present during the bullying or know about it beforehand, they can take action to discourage it. Regardless of when they learn about it (before, during, or afterwards), all bystanders can refuse to give the bully the status, popularity, and power that he/she is looking for. Bullying then ceases to be a useful tool for the bully to achieve his/her goals. Players learn in the game that they can do a great deal to discourage bullying, even with things as simple as telling a bully to stop or refusing to laugh at a bully&rsquo;s mean jokes.

If not, add a peg or make a Hue Turn to get the pattern you need to score your card! Patterns show two, three or four peg positions with complex patterns worth more points than simple ones. See how good your pattern recognition is.&#10;&#10;The cards each show a pattern of 2, 3, or 4 colored dots, and are divided into a 2-dot deck, a 3-dot deck, and a 4-dot deck.&#10;Players start with 3 cards (one from each deck), a set of double-sided Pegs (Red/Silver Pegs, Silver/Black Pegs, and Black/Red Pegs), and Green &quot;Hue Turn&quot; Pegs.&#10;&#10;On their turn, a player may either place one of their Pegs onto the board (with either color facing up), or discard a Green &quot;Hue Turn&quot; Peg to flip an existing Two-Colored Peg on the board.  The current player then reveals any Pattern Cards that were created by the action they took this turn, keeping them in front of them for scoring at the end of the game.  Then they refill their hand from any of the draw piles.&#10;&#10;The game ends after any two decks are exhausted and all remaining players take one more turn.  Score one point for each colored dot on the cards you collected, plus 2 points for each unused Hue Turn Peg.  The highest total wins!&#10;&#10;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Pattern Recognition, Spatial Visualization&#10;&#10;"

Whatever number is rolled is how many spaces that player's Pawn will move (forward or backward).&#10;&#10;After the die is thrown, the player to the right draws a Foodle Trivia Card from the box and reads it aloud.  Foodle questions are True/False or Multiple Choice, so you may get lucky with a guess, even if you don't know the correct answer!&#10;&#10;A few of the spaces on the board are marked &quot;Foodle-Do!&quot;  If a player ends their turn on one of these spaces they immediately must perform the activity on their current Foodle-Do card.  When moving backward after missing a question, always stop on a Foodle-Do space.  Also treat the START space as a Foodle-Do space.&#10;&#10;Each time a player moves ahead into a new color, they should discard their current Foodle-Do card and draw a new one.&#10;&#10;The first player to advance to the &quot;Finish&quot; space is the winner.&#10;&#10;WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Portion Sizes, Nutritional Facts, Making Healthy Choices&#10;&#10;"
