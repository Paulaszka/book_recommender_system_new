If their roll turns out lower than desired, the player may pay a clue to roll an additional die to add to the value. If a player exceeds the witness value, the witness cracks under pressure and gives bad information, causing the offending player to lose two clues. After all players have rolled, the player who is closest to the witness value without cracking the witness gains clues equal to the number of dice they rolled.&#10;&#10;The game ends once any player gets 15 or more clues at the end of a round.&#10;&#10;"

Both players have identical sets of ten fighters, with three fighters in each of three colors with values 1&ndash;3 along with a tri-colored boss valued at 4; these fighters are placed in small stacks of varying size onto a line that's eleven steps long. On a player's turn, he rolls the three colored dice and can make up to three moves accordingly, with the blue die moving a blue fighter, etc. Moving a fighter that has other fighters on top of him moves these other fighters as well.&#10;&#10;If, as a result of movement, his fighter (or stack of fighters) encounters an enemy, a fight between the two top cards in each stack occurs, the result of which is decided primarily by the color (via a rock-paper-scissors mechanism) and secondarily by the number (highest wins). If the boss wins a fight, its power is reduced by the enemy's power for the remainder of the current fight; if two fighters draw, they both retreat one step toward their own village, possibly precipitating other fights on the same turn. The fight continues until either pile is depleted.&#10;&#10;The first player to either defeat all of the opposing fighters or reach the end of the line (and clear out the opponent's fighters in his village) wins.&#10;&#10;"

It is played on a 14 x 14 square grid with nine squares of each corner removed, resulting in a cross-shaped checkered board.  The game is played on the dark squares only, and each wing of the board has twelve dark squares to host twelve pieces in their starting positions.  There are pieces of four colors: black, white, red, and green.  Each player chooses a partner and their own color, and sets up their pieces in starting positions opposite the board from each other.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board.&#10;&#10;Players move their pieces and capture other players the same as in Checkers, moving only towards the opposite side of the board until their pieces can be crowned in their partner's home row, and moving in any direction after.  Only opponent's pieces may be jumped or captured.  Pieces cannot be crowned in opponent's home rows.  Movements are not otherwise restricted on any part of the board.  The team who eliminates their opponents' pieces, or prevents them from moving, wins the game.&#10;&#10;There is one variant provided for in the game's rules, in which players are allowed to jump their partner's pieces without capturing them.&#10;&#10;"

Larger battles can be fought without difficulty, but more than an evening should be set aside for such games.&#10;&#10;There is no set ground scale or ship scale. The rules were devised for what felt right using 1:600 model ships. Fleets in classical times were very large, often several hundred ships strong, manned by tens of thousands.With this in mind it is suggested that historical scenarios should be fought using a ratio of one model to 10 - 20 ships.&#10;&#10;If using 1:1200 scale models or smaller, use centimetres instead of inches.&#10;&#10;"

A clever mechanism helps the other players to generate a range of stories in little time. When the story is over, each player attempts to deduce and guess the mood of the protagonist player: Secretly, players choose a specific mood on their mood wheels, then everybody reveals their choice. Points are scored depending on how close your choice is to the protagonist's chosen mood. The protagonist-player scores victory points depending on how close the other players get to his chosen mood.&#10;&#10;When everybody has scored points, the role of the protagonist passes clockwise, and a new turn starts. The first player to reach 24 victory points wins.&#10;&#10;"
