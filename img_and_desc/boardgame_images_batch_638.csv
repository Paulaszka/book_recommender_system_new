The attacking is rolling for crowbars and the defender is trying to get enough trashcan lids to defend.&#10;The winner gets to root through the other players hand, or even put nasty things into it.  If the winner is the person who started they fight they then get to rummage through the pile of trash.&#10;Rummage through the trash, while collecting trash cards and trying to create matching sets of items. Match the image and names of the items on the face of your cards.&#10;&#10;The goal of all versions of Dumpster Brawl is to collect enough matching trash items to make at least three (3) sets of three (3) or more matching items (such as three pizza boxes, three apple cores, and three soda cans) while not having any extra cards in your hand that are not part of the matched sets you are laying down. All extra cards, that do not match your victory sets, have to be discarded before you can lay your sets down and win.&#10;&#10;Note: You can have more than three sets and the sets can be larger than three cards.&#10;All play styles of Dumpster Brawl require the collection of the trash cards.&#10;&#10;There are thirteen (13) types of trash items and seven (7) of each item in the game.&#10;While rooting around in the trash you are, also, looking for booster cards that can help you win and defeating the blocker cards you might encounter as they can hurt your chances at winning but beware the slugs!&#10;&#10;Key Features&#10;&bull;    Quick fun game play&#10;&bull;    Multiple play methods&#10;&bull;    Each play is unique&#10;&bull;    You have to make sure you keep and discard the right cards and play your boosters at the right time&#10;&#10;"

A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war.&#10;&#10;Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor.&#10;&#10;Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT's Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) &#10;    Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) &#10;    Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals)  for battles and skirmishes with line infantry &#10;    Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids&#10;    Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French &#10;    French blockades to confound British plans&#10;    French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort&#10;    A large deck of 110 + cards for great play variety &#10;    Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges:&#10;&#10;As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region.  With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will.  You will muster Tories to support your efforts.  They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover.  You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map.  The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive.  With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align.  Each leader brings something new to the war effort.  If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order.  If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up!&#10;&#10;As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army.  You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas.  Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars.  Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance.  Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive.  Will the French be there when you need them?  Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up.  Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British.&#10;&#10;As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British.  You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages.  The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region.  War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack?&#10;&#10;As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America.  With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection.  Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle.  You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British.&#10;&#10;As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.  The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities.  Rabble-rousing, Indian Raids, Persuasion, Naval Pressure, Letter of Marque, Looting, Trading, Skirmishing, and Foraging and more options are available.

Victory is achievable through a number of viable options, which guarantees high re-playability.&#10;&#10;The game is a fight over acquiring the best locations for your huts in this appealing and unspoiled landscape. If you manage to do so, you will become the rightful successor of the old chief and win the game. You gain Chief points by having the most huts (and the secondmost huts) along each of the eight divine paths monitored by the statues of Gods. Additional Chief points are earned by controlling sacred locations, by collecting amulets, and simply by building huts at lucrative spaces.&#10;&#10;Building a hut requires that the space's landscape is &quot;active&quot; and that you can pay the exact price (not overpay) for the space. Therefore, the game feels tight even from the very start. The game gets tighter and tighter towards the end of the game as you have fewer choices of spaces, and as the actions you choose become more and more crucial.&#10;&#10;In order to succeed in this game, you should carefully choose and time the best possible combination of actions, called &quot;ritual sites&quot;. A boat goes from ritual site to ritual site, first on the west side, then on the east side (in opposite order), triggering each action. If, for instance, you choose a ritual site high up, you will have an early choice of cards, but a late choice of space to build your huts or to collect amulets (and vice versa). A fourth action type is to select &quot;active landscapes&quot; and become starting player, which makes it possible to control the next round. After all players have performed two actions, the round ends. The game is usually played over 10-14 rounds and ends when one player builds his last hut.&#10;&#10;Collecting amulets may be key in this game. Instead of keeping them as Chief points, you may use them to build huts on designated spaces which require payment in amulets instead of cards &mdash; and still to the exact price. Building huts on such spaces may be exactly what you need to get the majority along one or two divine paths. In order to gain enough amulets &mdash; and amulets of the appropriate values &mdash; you should position some of your huts on amulet spaces. The more huts you build on such spaces, the more amulets you can draw. The probability of getting the amulets you need will therefore increase.&#10;&#10;The game board is built as a matrix system, with some spaces being part of two divine paths while other spaces belong to just one.

Enough said.&#10;&#10;Hitman Holiday is game of deduction and strategy where as many as up to ten players take on the roles of ten of the deadliest assassins mankind has ever known. Gathered at the world's most beautiful resort, otherwise known as Paradise, they are out to play a game of death in a bid to eliminate competition in business as well as claim the much coveted title of Number One.&#10;&#10;A truly unique game, one may say it is what happens when Cluedo meets Battlestar Galactica meets Werewolf. The game begins with each player having a secret target to assassinate. The fun part is that the targets do not know yet which player is targeting them. This means that while you are trying to find a way to secretly kill off your assigned target, somewhere out there among the players is also someone trying to kill you, and it is up to you to find out who before it is too late! This is all done at the resort, which provides a ton of ways to kill someone, such as shoving them off a balcony, or dropping that accidental flower pot from three stories above. The game also takes on a different angle from the generic James Bond killer image, presenting its killers from all walks of life, even including old women and innocent looking young ladies. Instead of purely guns, they also use almost anything around the resort, turning innocent objects into lethal weapons.&#10;&#10;There are hidden actions, and the need to deduce who is killing who based on clues that drop now and then. Observing how each player behaves on the board also gives away clues sometimes as to whether or not they are your assigned killer. This is and will always remain the very FIRST game from Medieval Lords, and one that has taught the studio a ton in terms of experience and execution.&#10;&#10;WARNING: Due to the large number of players the game can go up to, you might have to expect a longer downtime than the average game!&#10;&#10;"

The game is simple: manage cooperation and competition with other players across five releases to score the most points. Each round of Release! is played the same way, but the scoring rules change as you reveal new tools and methods. Your team needs to continuously respond to these strategic shifts in order to produce the best release possible.&#10;&#10;Release's core mechanics are modeled after classic trick trump games. Rounds, or releases, are played by each player contributing a card to a trick, generally the highest card thrown takes the trick. This continues until the players are out of cards, at which point in time they score the release.&#10;&#10;Scoring rules are where it gets tricky.  Every release the players will reveal a new scoring methodology. These scoring rules award or subtract points for taking; various combinations of cards, lump sums of suits, or a specific number of tricks.  This means that some rounds you want may want to lose as many tricks as possible, win as many as possible, or fish for specific cards.&#10;&#10;The face cards lend further complexity, these cards all have special bonus powers that do things like: affect their rank, steal previously won cards, award instant points, and much more.&#10;&#10;The game itself is themed to evoke certain trends of software development. Themeing elements include naming conventions, fun copy, and the face cards are all modeled after famous 'faces' of the development community.&#10;&#10;"

The salvage of a lifetime just drifted into nearby space. Unfortunately, you're not the only salvage crew to respond. Since you all arrive at the derelict together, interstellar salvage laws apply. Within the ship are dangers and rewards alike, just waiting for you.&#10;&#10;In this fast-paced game of risk-taking and decision-making, you and up to four additional players try to claim the most salvage from the derelict ship before its failing engines finally explode. You'll go room to room gathering up salvage and avoiding deadly hazards. Will you get out of the derelict and tuck away your acquired salvage, or press your luck against the growing threat of the deadly hazards?&#10;&#10;This game can be played in under 30 minutes and is simple enough to be grasped by young players. Older players, however, will enjoy it even more as they weigh the odds and make their decisions.&#10;&#10;Each player is a faction that has an immunity, and the push your luck aspect comes from flipping the top card of the deck.  You can get salvage points that are evenly distributed among the players left on the ship and the left over goes to a kitty.  You can also flip over a hazard, which only kills you the second time a hazard of the same type is revealed.  Before you flip the next card, you have a tile that says, stay, or to back to ship. If you go back to ship, you keep the points that you have gathered and take the kitty points.  If you stay, you keep going until everyone dies or leaves for their ship.  There are five stages of the game.  Each stage you also shuffle an artifact and a black hazard which no one is immune to into the deck.  Each faction also has an artifact that will score them 20 points, whereas if you don't get your special artifact, it is only 10 points.  At the end of the five stages, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Kunlun is what is called a 'deck-building game,' for up to four players. The game is based on the story &ldquo;Warriors of Magic Mountain.&rdquo; Each player takes control of one Sect of the Kunlun Immortals, and they must compete with each other in defeating the dread forces of the Heart-Eaters. By defeating the Heart-Eaters, each player accumulates Cultivation. At the end of the game, once all the Heart-Eaters are defeated, the player with the most Cultivation is the winner.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players play a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of cards, building up the player&rsquo;s &ldquo;ready deck&rdquo; and attacking the demon enemies. In each turn, players can &quot;obtain&quot; a card once, and attack once. Players can obtain spells as well as obtain &quot;meditation&quot; cards which are used to obtain more, stronger cards.  Players may also &quot;obtain&quot; Immortal warriors from their Immortal Roster area; Immortals are the foot-soldiers in the war against the Heart-Eaters.&#10;&#10;Each turn of the game is strategically important; one wrongly played hand can mean the difference between first and last place.&#10;&#10;There are four Sects of Immortals in Demonslayer, and each plays differently from each other. The Kunlun Sect excels at bringing high-powered Immortal warriors out quickly, each building on the other&rsquo;s strength. The Qicheng sect is good at calling on reserve Immortals to join the battle. The Kongtong Sect is proficient at Alchemy; creating powerful artifacts which help the Sect in it&rsquo;s battle&rsquo;s against the Heart Eaters. The noble Wuyi Sect Immortal Warriors sacrifice themselves for devastating combo attacks. Every sect also has 1 Sect Leader Immortal, who provides special powers which serve to define how the sect plays.&#10;&#10;The enemy of the game are the &ldquo;Heart-Eaters;&rdquo; demonic warriors who have attained immortality by reveling in lustful destruction and excess. Many of the heart eaters have spiritual parasites &ndash; called &ldquo;Miasma&rdquo; which infect the players after slaying. However, players also sometimes attack &ldquo;Treasure Beasts&rdquo; which can grant players special abilities once they are won.&#10;&#10;In one &quot;wave&quot; of Demonslayer, there are 8 Heart Eaters and one &quot;Overlord;&quot; a leader of that wave of Heart-Eaters. Demonslayer: Siege of Mt. Kunlun is not, strictly speaking, a game of inter-player competition. Players compete with each other to have the honor of being the most successful at protecting the heavens and Earth from the demon hoards. Yet, players are are essentially cooperating to defeat the enemy.&#10;&#10;This English-language version of the game already incorporates one expansion, called The Alchemist's Fortune. In time, we will release new expansions for you to enjoy, incorporating more players, more cards, more options, more strategy, and most of all &ndash; more fun.&#10;&#10;"
