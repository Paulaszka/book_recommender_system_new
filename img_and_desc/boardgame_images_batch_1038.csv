Each time you play the game, you write a new tale. It is your very own tale of war!&#10;&#10;Key gameplay features:&#10;&#10;- Skill-based combat. Players take turns activating one unit at a time and either move it to another position or attack an opponent&acute;s unit. Tales of War doesn&rsquo;t use dice, nor cards to resolve combat. Instead defeating enemy units is as simple as either moving your melee unit onto a square occupied by them or positioning your ranged units in the line of fire and range.&#10;&#10;Each unit has different equipment, which defines its special rules. For example, units equipped with spears will automatically repel a direct cavalry charge and archers cannot make a frontal assault on units armed with shields. A player can still use the cavalry to outmanoeuvre a unit equipped with spears and devastate it with a flank or rear charge, just as archers may trap a shielded enemy by attacking at an angle.&#10;&#10;There are 21 unit types and each has unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses. As the campaign progresses, your initially small force expands to include units, such as Elves, Dwarves, Fire and Ice Sorceresses, Giants, Hydras, Fire Elementals or even Vampires!&#10;&#10;- RPG-like sense of progression and a constant arms race. Both armies evolve from one battle to the next, and your heroes learn new skills making them more dangerous on the battlefield;&#10;&#10;- Replayability. Tales of War offers new, unique challenges and strategic/tactical possibilities each time you play. Each battle has its own victory conditions and is played on unique terrain. You will face a different, custom-built army each battle, just as your own army will have been re-equipped and re-organised.&#10;&#10;- Fast setup and quick turns. Tales of War takes under 5 minutes to set up and tear down. Watching your opponents moves is as exciting as making your own as it always has an impact on the situation on the board;&#10;&#10;- Ease of saving campaign progress. Simply put your units and their cards into your army box and that's it. You can pick up where you left off in the next session.&#10;&#10;"

As an investigator, your only goals are to survive and escape.&#10;&#10;Investigators move around the board in a point-to-point fashion using their base movement speed. They may sprint to move more quickly, but they need to keep an eye on their stamina so they don't become exhausted. Additionally, investigators can pick up and use items, lock and unlock doors, or use their flashlights to try and find the adversary. Meanwhile, the adversary is secretly moving around the board, trying to stop the investigators from escaping. There are a variety of investigators to choose from, each with their own special abilities. The adversary also has multiple attacks and abilities that change how you play the game.&#10;&#10;Will you fix the car and drive out, or will you override the gate and try to sneak out? The investigators will need to decide if they want to stick together to watch each other's backs, or split up to race towards the exit.

The game is themed around visiting the graves of your departed family members through a trick-taking mechanic.&#10;&#10;The suits in the game correspond to your different family members (e.g. Grandpa, Aunt, &quot;That Uncle&quot;), and each is worth a different number of points.  At the start of a hand, players choose one card from their hand to bid with.&#10;&#10;During the game play, tricks can have 1 or 2 winners. The first winner of the trick is the person who played the highest card of the lead suit or the trump suit (monks).  That player takes each of those cards, and sets them in a pile next to their bid card, with a specified card on top.  If any players visited the grave adjacent to the lead suit, that suit can also have a winner, and that person makes a similar stack.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, a player has met their bid if in the piles they've created next to it from winning tricks, they are showing another card of the bid suit, and the points for the visible cards sum to exactly the rank of the bid card.  The player who met their bid and scored the most points wins.&#10;&#10;The game includes several &quot;advanced&quot; modules, such as special powers; a tie-break card; and a story-telling aspect where the winner of a trick is encouraged to share a memory of a family member of the lead suit.&#10;&#10;"

Each assault is a separate game based on a chit-pull system that can be completed in several hours.  Historically the Union bested rebel forces on both flanks because it fed enough reinforcements in to stem the gray tide But that is not to say that the rebels don&rsquo;t stand a chance. They do.&#10;&#10;FOG uses a chit pull system similar to John Poniske&rsquo;s Ball&rsquo; Bluff and Belmont designs.  Both games follow similar rules applying unique fire and movement, melee and order assignment. These are simple, rapid playing approaches to complex situations.  FOG clocks in at three to three and a half hours per game and provides high solitaire capability.&#10;&#10;The battles of Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Little Roundtop demonstrated Lee&rsquo;s determination to attack and envelop the Union Army of the Potomac. FOG does not attempt to recreate either grand assault in full, rather it presents the desperate three-hour finale that took place on the extreme ends in both cases These were the two instances when Lee came closest to claiming a Gettysburg breakthrough. &#10;Culp&rsquo;s Hill offers the Union prepared defensive positions but the liability of having reinforcements report to General Greene before joining the line. Little Round Top introduces artillery and sharpshooters and challenges players to exit or block the exit of Rebel forces between Little and Big Round Tops.&#10;&#10;Each game offers a beautiful Rick Barber map and a low counter mix. Regimental draw chits allow companies to move, volley fire or melee at the player&rsquo;s discretion.

Once you reach the putting green near the end of a hole, you switch to a putter die that tells you how many putts it took you to get the ball in that hole. Add up the total of each player's strokes/putts on that hole, and record it on the scoresheet. Then continue on the next hole.

The first to put out six fires wins the game. The fire locations are marked on the game board in order. The players roll the dice and move their fire engines towards the fire scene. The first player to reach the exact location of the fire has extinguished the fire and may advance one space on the success ladder. On yellow playing fields, an action card can be drawn to trigger an advantage for one's own fire department or a disadvantage for another fire department.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Each turn, a card is revealed that shows one or two hands and a combination of colored rings. As quickly as you can, move the rings from finger to finger to recreate that pattern before anyone else. The fastest player to do so wins the card, and whoever first collects five cards wins.&#10;&#10;Some constraints will make the task harder, such as treating one color as another or forcing you to switch rings without looking at your fingers.&#10;&#10;"
