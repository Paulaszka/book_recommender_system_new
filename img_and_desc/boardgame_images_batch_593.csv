The goal is for players to collect the most money. The game starts with players making piles of two cards that add up to $100. Once these starting piles have been made, the stealing can begin. You can steal a pile by putting a money card on top of the pile but the total of the top two cards must always equal $100. Slide the stolen pile to your side of the table. Piles can be stolen over and over again. A Thief card can steal a money pile. A Jail card can steal a pile with a Thief card. The player with the most money when the cards run out wins.&#10;&#10;"

It was inspired by the brilliant video game Hero Academy&trade; for iOS and contains similar gameplay mechanics. The combat system has been simplified to better fit the physical board game format.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;Players send units to attack enemy castles and defend their own. You win by destroying all enemy castles OR units.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: &#10;-The game board resembles a rectangular chess board. Players agree on a layout and arrange their castles and bonus tiles (extra attack, shields, or bonus castle damage).&#10;-Players maintain a 6-card hand from their personal deck containing units (mage, healer, knight, etc.), spells, and equipment.&#10;-On their turn, players choose 5 actions to perform (cast a spell, move a unit, attack, heal, etc...).&#10;-Part of the game is trying out different moves to find the best plan, so you decide when your move is final.&#10;-Players receive bonus spell cards when two of their units are destroyed (this balances gameplay and allows you to counter an opponent's momentum).&#10;&#10;Strategy elements:&#10;-Units have strengths/weaknesses and must work as a team.&#10;-Formations help reinforce attack/defense effectiveness.&#10;-Board location and unit placement is key (e.g. &quot;Is my Knight far enough away to avoid being knocked out?&quot; &quot;Is my Archer close enough to knock out the enemy Healer?&quot;).&#10;-Unit trading: killing enemy units can leave yours exposed...is it worth the risk?&#10;&#10;"

Quite popular on Polish market due to much lower price.&#10;&#10;Scriba is an extended version of Scriba Travel, because it provides two variants of gameplay. The first variant is exactly the same, but the second is quite insane.&#10;&#10;The first variant is similar to Scrabble (but there are some differences). Players use their 6/7/8 (this is up to the players) drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. The differences between Scriba (1st variant) and Scrabble are:&#10;- If you play all but one letter from your rack you get 20 points bonus.&#10;- You can stack the letters on top of the already played (like in Upwords), but only two levels of letters are allowed&#10;- There are negative bonuses on the board.&#10;- The player that ends the game receive 50 points bonus (because he played all his letters, we don't mind if he had one or two).&#10;- If a player passes, he receives minus 5 points.&#10;- The are tiles with no letter but with a black spot. This can be placed anywhere adjacent to already played tiles and is usually used to prevent from extending a particular word.&#10;- The are tiles with a curved arrow (wich looks like 'enter key') which allows to play a word half vertically and half horizontally.&#10;&#10;The second variant uses every rule from first variant with some additional rules:&#10;- The players use chips in four colors to place all the bonuses on the board wherever they want.&#10;- Whenever a player uses the bonus, he takes the chip from the board and places it in front of him. Every chip is worth 1 point during the final scoring.&#10;- The start player does not have to place his first word in the middle of the board.&#10;- After every move the player roll a d6 and draws that number of letter-tiles.&#10;- There are 12 big yellow chips which at the start of the game are distributed to the players in equal shares. Every chip is worth 10 points at the end of the game. Whenever a player plays exactly four letter-tiles from is rack, he can take one big chip from a chosen opponent.&#10;&#10;"

Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&#10;&#10;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&#10;&#10;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action.

Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.&#10;    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.&#10;    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.&#10;    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.&#10;    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.&#10;&#10;&#10;When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends.

Pirate cards can be added to the ship in specific locations, replace other pirates, or be removed from the ship entirely (with adjacent cards being pushed together to close the gap). A variety of other cards add another layer of interest and player interaction to the game. For each silver coin icon matched on the ship, one actual coin is taken from the treasure pile.

It's described by the designer as &quot;super-charged Monopoly,&quot; but it's most similar to Mario Party without the mini-games. The game board is printed on map paper, which allows it to fit inside the small box. After unfolding the board, the colorful box top becomes the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of the game board. Players take turns rolling two dice off of the box top; at least one die must end up on the game board itself, and neither can roll farther than the board's border, or the roll is invalid. They then move the sum of their roll. Every space has special effect that triggers either when landed on or when leaving the space. The goal of the game is to collect feathers, represented by paper money, in order to buy puzzle pieces. Puzzle pieces can be purchased when the player lands on two of the corner spaces, and passing the Start Together space generates an income of 25 feathers. Feathers can also be gained and lost in various ways.&#10;&#10;Aside from rolling off the box top, the main distinguishing feature of the game is that each player's pawn is represented by a pair of stacked poker chips. When landing on the Banana Split garden space, the poker chips are split up, and are subsequently treated as separate pawns. If they ever occupy the same space, other than the Banana Split space, they are recombined. Split pieces give more options when moving, and some spaces reward the player for having their chips either combined or separated.&#10;&#10;As in Monopoly, rolling doubles allows the player to move again, and rolling snake eyes sends the other player's chips to the Bird Cage (identical to Monopoly's Jail space).&#10;&#10;Description from Kickstarter:&#10;&#10;Super-charged Monopoly. Dice fall off box, the game travels in. White and black poker-chips get pulled apart and put together.&#10;&#10;To play simply learn to drop the dice off the box, and keep them on the game-board.   The very first corner space states, Divide Your Game Parts.  What made that work, are five No/Rest circles added to select spaces.  They take away the choice, of which game-piece to move.  Before I adding those circles, catch-22's would happen.   A different space states, Exchange Your Bank of Feathers.  It allows a player to come from behind at anytime.&#10;&#10;The inside of the box works great as a game-bank.   Each time around the board Eagle, Duck and Seagull feathers are rewarded.   The goal of CENTERPIECE, becomes a RACE to purchase nine-puzzle-spaces one at a time.  Have a bank of two-hundred feathers, have game-parts together.  Then land on the Start Sun space, or Bidgecage space to WIN.  Players keep score, with black and white pawns, under the box, at the games center.   Who's best at finding the best price for a numbered puzzle-space, while staying out of the Birdcage corner space.  For example to Rent A Horse, to get to the Half-Price space, or not.&#10;&#10;All together there are twenty-eight game spaces.  One last example of a game-space states.  Roll Doubles While Here, and spend three-turns at the Birdcage corner. Your game pieces, if divided, would be joined again.  Rolling doubles while in the Birdcage, lets a player leave early.&#10;&#10;Because the game-board paper was designed for new maps, it folds forever.  ( It was the most expensive part of the game.)&#10;&#10;CENTERPIECE = fast-paced FUN!!!  Tested on family and friends.   People will ask what's the fun all about?

Players take turns revealing one card, and as soon as four instances of a color are visible &mdash; whether in the center of the card, in the color of the word, or in the word itself &mdash; the first player to slap the correct color card claims all cards bearing this color. When all of the cards are face up, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.&#10;&#10;In &quot;Antipode&quot;, you place all of the cards face up, then everyone races simultaneously to grab (with one hand) pairs of cards in which the color of the word on one card matches the written word on the other and vice versa. Whoever grabs the most correct pairs wins.&#10;&#10;Color Clash includes rules for six games and two solitaire challenges, while ChromaTikTak includes twelve games and puzzles, some of which push you to play quickly and some of which push you to think.&#10;&#10;"

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.&#10;&#10;But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.&#10;&#10;Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play &mdash; leading to immense variety.&#10;&#10;Dominion: Special Edition includes the Dominion base game &mdash; with the coin cards bearing new artwork first seen in the Dominion Base Cards accessory &mdash; as well as the &quot;Black Market&quot; card originally released as a promotional item.&#10;&#10;Part of the Dominion series.&#10;&#10;"

Each vehicle has a number of design options regarding which weapons are selected, engine size and various offensive and defensive accoutrements such as extra armour, targeting devises, smoke dischargers etc. This means that players can create very different vehicles from the same chassis. &#10;With the infantry we have divided them into a number of categories such as Light Infantry, Assault Infantry, Warriors and Heavy Weapons. Each category has a defined profile, a set of stats, weapons and armour that help it conform to their definition. This means that each type of squad has a particular function on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Light troops for instance move fast across the battlefield are good at scouting out the enemies dispositions and also getting out of trouble fast. Assault troops are designed to get in close with the enemy - they have the armour and firepower to take the fight to their opponents. The Warriors role is obviously to make contact with the enemy and destroy them in deadly hand-to-hand fighting. And Heavy Weapons teams are designed to hang back a bit and support forward units with heavy long-range fire.&#10;&#10;Players will therefore need to learn how to use their troops to their best advantage as well as how to combine them with other squads in their force for maximum efficiency and effect. For instance, using light troops to identify targets, using heavy weapons to weaken and suppress the target and then sending in the warriors to finish them off at close quarters. Sounds easy? Not so in practise! What this simply means that it is not just a case of the dude with the biggest gun winning the day (although the game does have plenty of big guns!). The right troops have to be used at the right time in the right way.&#10;&#10;The game also includes a number of leader types. These are heroes with certain special skills that will boost the performance of the force. Some of these figures might be just great individual fighters, others may have leadership skills that can enhance the power of the rest of the force.&#10;&#10;What is very apparent to players is the amount of choice that they have in creating their force, from vehicle design to infantry squad selection and leader choice. A different army can be assembled for every game. &#10;Most battles will be fought over very challenging terrain. All manner of risks and rewards can be found - from hidden obstacles, explosive and flammable materials but also extra ammunition and weapons. The terrain always plays its part in games of Sulphur.&#10;&#10;Another vital component to the game is the use of Asset Cards. These are played and collected during the game to further enhance the performance of a force. Each card is specific to a certain troop type (for example light squad, leader, vehicle etc). Each card will award the player a special skill or piece of equipment that will benefit that squad (and hopefully encourage the player to use the squad to its maximum advantage). These Asset Cards can have great significance in the game and add to the players burden of command and decision making - but they are a lot of fun too, especially when they thwart the plans of your opponent.&#10;&#10;And from time to time there are the deadly and unpredictable incursions of Sulphur. The deadly field of  battle is made even more challenging by this unholy threat. Will the combatants form a temporary truce and turn their guns on this new and devastating threat or will they abandon their opponents, withdraw from the field and let them face the terror alone? The menace of Sulphur hangs over every battlefield like a cloud. Most times it does not appear - but the fear and unease that it generates is ever present&hellip;&#10;&#10;"
