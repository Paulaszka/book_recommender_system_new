The first essentially creates the path that the players will be required to tackle: in each Path phase, 4 cards are added in front of the leading rider and all those in the queue of the last rider will be eliminated.  If there are no tiles behind them, the first one will be eliminated and the rider on it will suffer a penalty.&#10;&#10;In the Dark Rider phase, on the other hand, the action passes into the hands of the mysterious antagonist who will act following the action diagram shown on his card depending on the result obtained by rolling the RIDE die. It should be noted that this disturbing element will not be present immediately in the game, but will appear the first time a Rider should pass on a Path card with his symbol.&#10;&#10;Should the Dark Rider not be present, the Events phase will take care of complicating the players' life: here a card will be drawn from the relative deck and covered place on the Path.  It will be revealed, and activated, should a player end his turn on that specific card.  Note that there is nothing to prevent different Event cards from hitting the same route segment: in this case, all effects will be applied.&#10;&#10;In the last phase, the players can take turns taking action.  After drawing 4 cards (or less depending on certain situations) they will be forced to play one.  Therefore, according to a precise schedule they will have to: apply the indicated effect and advance by a number of Movement Points equal to, or lower than, those provided by the card.  Having determined the card on which you decide to end up, you will have to apply any reported effects, reveal and activate the Events and, if possible, fight against the other Riders.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game will be to accumulate more points than the others and, not secondary, to stay alive.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

The game deals unflinchingly with the weapons with which this war was fought &ndash; terror cells, double agents, the forced resettlement of ethnic and religious groups &ndash; prompting uneasy questions about how governments obtain, hold, and use power.&#10;&#10;Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.&#10;&#10;Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.&#10;&#10;All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

340775,,"2 years ago, we introduced true &quot;Reverse Deck-building&quot; to the world in the form of Shake Up. Today and for the first time ever, we introduce the concept of true &quot;Shared Deck-building&quot; - Everyone plays on the same single deck with the same hand, and yes everyone has a part in building this same single deck.&#10;&#10;In the Azure Peninsula, civilization has not tamed the breathtaking yet deadly nature it offers. Isle whales would crush entire towns in their passing, and river wyrms swallow whole camps. Yet every so often, a tiny hamlet or a cosy little village would spring up atop a hill. In our story, the village chief has just passed on, leaving a chaotic mess of younger heads to run the place. The Tool Master needs stone to craft useful items for everyone, while the Culinary Chief feeds the group, the Scouting Lead goes out with his party to patrol and scour for materials, and the Commander protects the walls and its inhabitants.&#10;&#10;They are but a tiny settlement with limited people. How will the different leaders work together to utilize their resources? Too much of one resource will cause some leaders to not be able to do what they have to do, and too little of anything could spell doom for everyone. A single deck represents the village, and players take on the roles of the various leaders. They must balance their own needs with those of other leaders in order to survive and thrive amidst a harsh land. Every leader is important!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Disturbing stories that surround Bedeville can send shivers down your spine. One of them, often considered the most real, tells a tale of Mr. Carl - a grave keeper and a grim owner of a local theme park.Mr. Carl arrived in Bedeville back when life and happiness bloomed in every corner of this little town. As a juggler and later - grave digger in a nearby graveyard, he barely made the ends meet. How did he get the fortune that let him create a theme park? We will probably never learn. Some think that he made a pact with a malignant, and fun-loving Trickster. That&rsquo;s the only explanation for what happened next, including the nightmare, that led Bedeville to its downfall. Citizens were forced to leave this grim place while Mr. Carl ended up doomed to eternal torment. What kind of torment? Having his theme park be visited by &ldquo;unique&rdquo; guests like the undead from the nearby graveyard. Additionally, to make Mr. Carl even angrier, they&rsquo;re invited every night by the ticket seller, who opens the grounds of Bedeville Carnival when dusk arrives.&#10;&#10;This is where your adventure begins. As corpses from the nearby graveyard, you will visit the crazy attractions of the theme park. It doesn&rsquo;t matter when and how you ended up in this burial ground. Each night an eerie force makes you wake up from the eternal slumber and feel alive again. Each night you will discover new attractions and collect Souvenirs before they&rsquo;ll get grabbed by grave digger&rsquo;s mean cat called Fleabag. But beware! Mr. Carl can catch you anytime and chase you back to the cemetery.&#10;&#10;The game is played in consecutive player turns. Each player has the goal of collecting the most Joy Markers and Souvenirs sold in the local Booths. When all Souvenirs end up being sold to the players - the game concludes. The player, who at the end has the most victory points awarded for their Joy Markers and Souvenirs collected, becomes the winner.&#10;&#10;Every Player picks their favorite undead unafraid of any, even the most dangerous Attractions. Next, you draw the crazy Attractions that the characters will move through during the game. By visiting more and more Attractions and performing Actions from the Attractions you will attempt to outsmart your graveyard friends. By using Actions in a smart way a Player will attempt to hold their position on a specific Attraction. Only this way they will be able to buy Souvenirs next turn. At the end of each turn, a player draws one Trickster&rsquo;s token from the bag and checks what destiny has for them in-store. Attractions generate Noise Markers. The more Noise, the bigger the chance that the Attractions will make the grave keeper arrive and chase the player&rsquo;s character back to the graveyard.&#10;&#10;"

With each ship lacking fuel to get home, each player must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using the gravity of the dimension and what little resources they have in order to reach the warp gate that will take them home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship, and when those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Time is running out to save your crew and your ship! As a grim reminder of the cost of failing to escape, the frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route &mdash; but with careful card play, you can slingshot past these derelict craft and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!&#10;&#10;Gravwell uses 26 alphabetized cards to determine movement order and thrust; most cards move your ship towards the nearest object, but a few move you away from it. At the start of each round, players draft fuel cards, picking up three pairs of two cards, with only the top card of each pile being visible; you get some information as to which moves you can expect from the other spaceships, but you won't know which moves you'll be forced to make when you draft your cards!&#10;&#10;During a round, each player will play all of their fuel cards in the order of their choosing. During each phase of a round, each player chooses one card, then all cards are revealed and resolved in alphabetical order. When your opponents move in ways you didn't expect, you won't always be heading in the direction you thought you would! Each player holds an &quot;Emergency Stop&quot; card that they may tactically play only once per round to avoid such a situation.&#10;&#10;Whoever first reaches the warp gate wins, but if no one has escaped after six rounds, then the player who is closest to the gate wins.&#10;&#10;Gravwell: 2nd Edition features the same gameplay as earlier editions of the game, but now 40 fuel cards are included, which allows up to six players in the game at the same time. (Earlier editions maxed out at four players.) Additionally, ship ability cards are included that can give a unique power to each ship's captain trying to find their way home.&#10;&#10;"

The HYPE deck has the strategic depth of a trading card game while the TAG deck has the simple fun of a classic card game.

Each HYPE card has a number in the upper corner and you must at that number (or higher) on your hype meter to play the card. Many cards also have a bonus, granting an even more powerful effect the higher you get. But... when you flip your meter over and start moving back down, your dwindling hype prevents you from getting bonuses and eventually makes some hype cards unplayable. So you have to be crafty and a little bit cutthroat to win. The game ends when the first player gets back down to 1.&#10;&#10;Be sure to manage your hand carefully because you have to play a tag card to tag an an opponent at the end of each turn. If you can't, you have to call a time out which rewards the other players. In 3 and 4 player games, Hype Tag has a unique non-standard turn order which gives players a choice about who to tag. And this choice carries strategic implications.&#10;&#10;The game also include &quot;Sass&quot; cards that block and copy the actions of others, trait bonuses that reward certain styles of play, and Older Kids - special character cards you receive when you reach 10 on your hype meter - that grant powerful abilities aiding your descent back down to 1.&#10;&#10;It is great casual fun that also stands up to very intense tournament style play.&#10;&#10;"
