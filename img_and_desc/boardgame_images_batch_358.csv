Whereas Rail Baron has 28 rail lines represented, from the pre-mega-merger period (before about 1970), Chattanooga Choo-Choo II only has 27 of the same lines. Each line has it's own card, with cities served (see below) shown as well.&#10;&#10;Which one is missing? It is the Norfolk and Western, which on the Rail Baron board serves Norfolk, Cincinnati, and Columbus destinations. It is interesting that the present-day Norfolk Southern is one of the few &quot;Class 1&quot; super-major railroads coming out of the merger period, but the railroad it owes it's heritage to is the one missing in this game.&#10;&#10;Rail Baron has 67 destination cities on the board and in the payoff table. Chattanooga Choo-Choo II has only 25 of those cities included in the card deck. The destination cards show which rail lines serve that city. Cities cards are dealt to the players at the beginning. The object is to collect railroads (by bidding for them) such that at the end of the game, the player maximizes the connections with his cities.&#10;&#10;The cities chosen to be included are generally those larger hubs with multiple rail connections. Cities in Rail Baron that are only served by one or two railroads are eliminated in the Chattanooga Choo-Choo II deck.

But good days for these enterprises are coming to an end as more and more ships are taking longer routes avoiding dangerous Somalia's shores. Only if your company  will convince the public of being the most successful in freeing hijacked ships you can count on being chosen as ONZ official ship negotiator providing you with endless profit possibility. But beware, competition is not going to give up easily ... more and more ships are being captured.&#10;&#10;&quot;S&#197;&#130;ony okup&quot; is an bidding board game in which during a round one player takes on a role of Pirate and the other players roles of negotiators. Negotiators bid for the possibility to free the ship using sum of three resources available in the game: money, prestige points and troops (anti terrorists). Winner of the bidding round presents his offer to a Pirate. He can either accept the offer gaining all the money proposed (that later he or she can use to free ships from other players) or he can rise the price by using troops (acting as pirates this time). If ship is freed negotiator gets prestige points otherwise the ships stays on a board and becomes more valuable as the public pressure rises. Now the next player becomes a Pirate. The winner is a player with most prestige points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game won the contest for best prototype on Pionek (Polish board game convention)&#10;&#10;"

There's no guesswork; every piece is based on the most thorough study ever devoted to a wargame. It even features all the Soviet and Japanese forces that engaged in the Nomonhan Incident, along with the units of every nationality that fielded a military in the war. Indeed, this is actually a division-level game, and is even more detailed than the acclaimed AETO.&#10;&#10;APTO and AETO can be linked to simulate the entire Second World War more accurately than any other game ever produced. This is more than an AETO supplement; though, in that it features special rules for: elite pilots, atomic bombs, midget submarines, coast-watchers, tropical disease and more.&#10;&#10;Advanced PTO is the most realistic yet playable game on the subject; it includes admirals and generals, every type of aircraft and every capital ship that existed in the Pacific Theater, and even some refits.

Devacurse presents a universe rent asunder by the warfare of rival gods.  Once-calm seas roil with the venom of serpentine nagas, Yaksas leave villages burning in their molten wake, and fearsome Himmapan creatures bellow their fury at the world of men.  Noble heroes, stately Garuda warriors, cunning Monkey lords, and treacherous demons lead their forces into battle in this epic conflict drawn from the lush imagination of Southeast Asian mythology.&#10;&#10;Read on to learn about Devacurse&rsquo;s setting, and what this ongoing journal has in store for curious English-speaking gamers.&#10;&#10;Players take on the roles of Devas, divine entities commanding the elements of earth, wood, fire, metal, water, and wind.  You will need to master them to defeat your opponent, a god just as powerful and determined to rule as you.  Whether you incarnate directly on the battlefield as a hero or bombard your enemy from afar with devastating incantations, you will need wits as well as strength to survive.&#10;&#10;Bless your warriors, summon allies, and commit your forces wisely in the ultimate contest of skill and intellect.  In Devacurse there can be no middle ground.&#10;&#10;The winner will inherit a universe; the loser, cold oblivion.&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;&#10;Devacurse was born from the imagination of Dr. Eiamchan Srithanon and his design team, the 6 Devabrothers:  SrithaNa Eiamchan and Mr. Korn (rules team and card designers), Sarit Chareonpanichkul (art director and trophy model sculptor) and Veerawat Jangpetch (art director), Saranyu (story director and character designer), and Srichai Eiamchan (production).  SrithaNa, Korn, Veerawat, and Saranyu were still studying architecture at King Mongkut&rsquo;s University of Technology Thonburi (KMIT) at the time, and art director Sarit was brought in from outside to complete the team.  Dr. Srithanon and his friends had been avid card gamers for years, but after seeing fellow Thais playing endless Western and Japanese imports, they decided it was time to create a distinctively Thai collectable card game.  Their goal was amibitious - Dr. Eiamchan and his team wanted to create a card game that didn&rsquo;t just feature Thai themes or look Thai, but one whose game mechanics embodied Thai style.  Two years of development and playtesting followed, and in 2007 Devacurse came on the market with an initial base set release, Half Blood Deal.  This was followed in 2008 with the first expansion set, Vengeful Kindred.&#10;&#10;Devacurse immediately impressed Thai players with its high production values, elegant design, and lavish artwork, with many comparing its high level of presentation to that of Wizards of the Coast&rsquo;s Magic the Gathering.  Currently Devacurse commissions work from over 30 professional artists in Thailand.  Once players learned the rules, they were impressed again by supple game mechanics that rewarded tactical planning and captured the essence of Thai culture.  Specifically, the game strongly recalls the fantastical world of the Thai Ramayana painted on the walls of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, in the Royal Palace complex in Bangkok.  It also subtly incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist prayer and Samsara, the cycle of reincarnation, into the structure of play.&#10;&#10;The Devacurse card layout incorporates elements of Thai Buddhist and Hindu cosmology.&#10;&#10;Devacurse is a sophisticated and still-evolving piece of genuinely Thai pop culture in a country that is often swamped by Western and Japanese influence, imports, and imitations.  Dr. Srithanon and his team are committed to bringing the legends of their heritage to life in the game, and the results so far have been unique and beguiling.&#10;&#10;Devacurse is currently published only in Thai, and has therefore been limited to Thai audiences.  This website aims to open up the world of Devacurse to English-speaking gamers and enthusiasts of Thai culture and Southeast Asian myth.  In the coming weeks and months I will be putting up a complete English translation of the Devacurse rulebook, followed by English translations of all of the current Devacurse cards (Half Blood Deal through Vengeful Kindred).  There will be an in-depth review of the game, and other articles on a variety of subjects (card spotlight, deck design, strategy, back story) will hopefully follow.&#10;&#10;If all goes well, determined English speakers should be able to play and enjoy the Thai edition of Devacurse with the information posted on this website, until such a time as Devacurse is published in English.&#10;&#10;Enjoy, and welcome to the epic world of Devacurse.&#10;............&#10;&#10;more ....&#10;&#10;http://devacurseinenglish.wordpress.com  (English)&#10;&#10;http:// www.devacurse.com  (Thai)&#10;&#10;"
