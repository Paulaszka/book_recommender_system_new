The game materials content was a bit limited; you were given a list of the unit counters and a photograph of the map, which was a giant Stalingrad board with a few extra terrain features, especially in Finland.  The limited assertions in 2.1 appear to imply that the game was played using the rules for Stalingrad, though references in Stalingrad III to Divisional Stalingrad imply that you could also use the Stalingrad III rules.  Nonetheless, it really is a game, a bit under-presented like many other early games, such as Operation Gigantis (which eventually became Confrontation).&#10;&#10;The theme is the German invasion of Russia in World War 2. The goals and game play could be identical (except for the new map and new list of counters) with either AH Stalingrad or Poultron Press Stalingrad III, depending on the optional rules choice made by the players, because the optional rules choice was to use one rules book or the other rules book.&#10;&#10;If the game was played using the Stalingrad rules, the core rules were:&#10;&#10;Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one square) or retreat (two squares) after combat.  Units have one-square thick zones of control; movement directly from one square in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining square of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one square per turn movement), mountains (one square per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten square movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns.&#10;&#10;Stalingrad was the first board war game with the modern placement of rivers down the middle of hexagons, rather than the old-fashioned placement of rivers on hex edges, as also seen in Stlingrad II.&#10;&#10;"

The campaign marks the debut of Frederick the Great's military career, however inauspicious this was for him personally. The war began with Prussia taking advantage of a perceived weakness of the new and first Queen of Austria, Maria Theresa, when she assumed the throne. Bavaria, France, and Saxony contested Maria's claim to the Austrian crown, as well as having long disputes over their borders or policies of the Austrian empire. Prussia sought to claim the rich province of Silesia from Austria and in a whirlwind (for the time) campaign in 1740 seized virtually the entire province. Prussia's Allies took longer to mobilize their forces and work out the disputes they had with one another to form a coalition to defeat Austria and overthrow its new queen. A long era of war in central Europe was about to begin.

Taking turns, they form lines of these cards, but they can neither place the same color twice in a row nor have the cards in a row sum to more than nine. Each time a player plays a card, he takes one of the face-up cards as replacement to his hand.&#10;&#10;Making a row sum to nine gains you that row, and you skip your turn for the remainder of the round.

The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.&#10;&#10;Complicating matters (optionally) is that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.&#10;&#10;Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder.  The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&rsquo;s rating for the current &ldquo;search&rdquo;.  There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched.

These tokens can later be used to help with tasks.  However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances.

Roll the dice and move your plane from the airfield or along the flight path, if you land on another plane they go back to the nearest empty space. Rolling a six allows you to bring a plane from your terminal to the airfield and gives you another go. When one of your planes reaches 32,000ft (this does not have to be an exact throw) you remove it to your '32' spaces next to your terminal. The first to get all four planes to 32,000ft is the winner.&#10;&#10;Land&#10;Play works as above, but you start at 32,000ft and work your way down to the airfield, landing has to be an exact throw or you overshoot the runway.&#10;&#10;Take Off &amp; Land&#10;Choose which players are going to 'Take Off' and which players are going to 'Land' and place planes accordingly. Enter the flight path either way by the amount you throw with the dice. If you settle into airspace that is occupied by another player then your opponents plane must leave the flight path altogether and return to its starting position.&#10;Roll a six to get another plane on the flight path, after rolling a six place the plane six airspaces in. You do not need to throw the exact number when finishing. Then put your plane either at 23,000ft or in your terminal and airfield depending on whether you were Taking Off or Landing. The first person to successfully complete their flight with all their aircraft is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
