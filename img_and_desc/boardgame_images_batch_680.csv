It is but a stepping stone to your true calling. Your rightful dominion&hellip; over all the world!  Reign of Man is an empire management and territory control war game, for 2-5 players, that takes around an hour from start to finish.&#10;&#10;Summary: &#10;Reign of Man is a fast paced new take on the strategy war game that tips its hat to classics of the past while presenting a fresh and approachable combination of territory control, engine building and rapid dice driven battle resolution. Reign of Man moves along at a clip, as each player can only choose one action to take each turn, and it doesn&rsquo;t take all afternoon to play to resolution, unlike many of its predecessors. Players are all equally effected by global events, which everyone sees coming several turns in advance. This helps guide you to knew strategies and lend replayability without being punishingly random. Winning comes down to engine development and not just having all the land. Exactly how you win depends on how you rule your kingdom. The Legendfolk and March of the Damned expansion introduce a host of high fantasy themes and, like the core game, are brought to life by the incredible artwork of Erwin Arozza.&#10;&#10;Reign of Man - Legendfolk (included expansion)&#10;&#10;Legendfolk introduces a set of fantastical ancient races that exist in the world but aren&rsquo;t widespread enough for a grab at controlling it. They fear for their people and will offer their skills in return for protection. Players may contact them and dedicate armies from their available army pools to bolster their defenses, through a bidding process, in order to take advantage of their special abilities and units. This expansion can be played with 2 - 5 players in conjunction with the Reign of Man rules and components.&#10;&#10;Reign of Man &ndash; March of the Damned (included expansion)&#10;&#10;The world shudders as your people watch the dead rise under the command of great and powerful Lich Queens. Wicked beasts, they wield otherworldly powers and lay waste to our lands. Who will save us? Who will command our armies? The people await your mercy and your might. This variant can be played by itself or along with the Legendfolk. The Reign of Man rules apply to March of the Damned.&#10;&#10;Gameplay Overview&#10;&#10;Players begin the game with an empire mat that is somewhat developed and get right into the action of taking a single action each turn, in clockwise order.&#10;&#10;Basic actions are to:&#10;&#10;Develop your empire, building your engine by making improvements to your empire mat  &#10;Mobilize armies by moving them to adjacent territories, and in some cases trigger battles, resolved by the rolling of dice  &#10;Raise more armies by placing them on territories you control.  &#10;Starting in the third turn players will be effected by a World Event card each turn. You can always see these cards two turns in advance of their taking place, so they will drive dynamic strategic decisions. Each development category on your mat has a high rank ability that grants you victory points. As soon as one emperor reaches three victory points, the game is over and they win! The rightful ruler of all the world!&#10;&#10;Attributes&#10;&#10;Reign of Man rounds move lightning-quick because you can only &quot;do one thing&quot; on your turn. Even battle resolution moves quickly. There is no money. While player elimination is possible, it is very much not common.&#10;&#10;Designer Notes&#10;&#10;This game is a territory control war game and definitely tips its hat to some such classics of the past, but it doesn't play like most of those games. It's a much shorter overall play time and is more approachable. Turns are fast-paced and battles are resolved in no time. You won't suffer a slow grind to attrition. You won't have to sit at the table and finish a long grind to the inevitable, wherein you feel like you've already lost and there's no coming back. Victories are rarely won by player elimination, but are a race to prominence. We wanted to preserve the best parts of those classic games in the genre and fix the problems we saw germane to their most common mechanics. We love this game and sincerely hope you will too!&#10;&#10;"

While Turtles live in an empire based on manpower and industrial development, Frogs are ruled by an Evil King that assures the wellness of his reign through war and conquests. For ages Turtles were forced to rise the level of their military tactics to defend the borders from the brute force of the Frog army. Battle after battle, Turtle defenses weakened, giving Frogs a great opportunity. Now the Frog King is coming, with new technological warfare machines. The next assault could create a direct passage to the Turtle land. The time is right, and unexpected: Turtles are not warned about the Frogs arrival.

The game lasts 8 rounds.  Everyone starts with a hand of 9 Teamwork cards (1-9) and each turn plays one card that will indicate how much effort you are going to put into the project, and consequently what order you will get to choose the research cards on offer.  Teamwork cards are chosen and revealed simultaneously.  If both team members play the same card they automatically lose ! Then Teammates add up their total teamwork effort for the Team Total, and the Team with the highest Total chooses first with the player in that team who played the highest card taking the pick and keeping it for himself.  Then the lowest card player in the losing team goes next.

Better hurry, you are not the only one after the job!&#10;&#10;The game includes over 100 game cards, 10 General Store cards &amp; 6 custom shooter dice.

The tougher the bandit the more suit symbols will appear.  The player can roll and re-roll the 6 dice up to 3 times to try to capture the bandit by matching these symbol.  Jokers are wild and can be used as any suit. Skulls, if rolled, render the die out of play.  Once captured you can stop &amp; collect the bandit by moving them into you jail, or you may press your luck &amp; try to grab more bandits.  If you decide to continue on your hunt you get to re-roll all of your dice, minus any skulls previously rolled, for three more chances to capture the new bandit.  Lose any bandit on your turn &amp; you lose ALL the bandits collected this round!&#10;&#10;Each bandit has a reward amount for their capture as well as 1 to 2 reputation points to put towards your promotions.
