The winning card is the one with the highest value and of the same color as the first card played.  The winning card's owner collects the entire set and gets to be the starting player for the next round.  However, the owner of the card with the lowest value and of the same color as the winning card takes the highest value card in the set.  The game then continues with the next round of passing, playing, and scoring the cards.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cards have been played and collected.

Players assume the roles of rich influential men who try to make profits by exploiting and buying out the East German industry.&#10;&#10;The game is played over the course of 16 rounds, in which each player takes a turn of action.  After every 4 rounds, the effects of the players' actions are asserted on the industry and their profits and losses are tallied.  Depending on the space their token lands on, players can undertake four types of actions.  They can buy an East German operation, getting it for free by impersonating as a former owner (the result of a good dice roll) or outbidding the other players in the resulting auction.  Usually, the followup action is to lay off the workers of these operations (at the expense of the industry) to increase profits.  Players can also increase profits by taking the action to grab the grants for rescuing the ecology of the ravaged industrial lands.  The last action is to negotiate with each other to manipulate the market to their benefits through threats, bargains, and bribes.  During the course of the game, cards are drawn that allow their owners to influence the effects of their actions or to affect their opponents'.&#10;&#10;The game ends with the conclusion of the final (16th) round.

It combines both luck and skill. There are variants of the game from basic to advanced.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, players are given 12 cards (each with a number on from 1-12) and they shuffle them and place them face down. Each player turns a card over in turn and moves that many spaces - there are overtaking areas and opportunities to block. The car that reaches the finish first is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The advance level allows for more skill to be involved. Each player has their 12 cards and they choose which one to play. Therefore, you can be more tactical by blocking and attempting overtaking moves. You choose the number of laps, whether pit stops should be used etc. Once all players have used their cards, the process begins again.&#10;&#10;The board represents Silverstone and the cars are folded cardboard inserted into tabs.

There are red and blue cards that can bring good or bad luck. These have to be acted upon immediately.

Each player has their own 7x7 grid and a player screen to hide their boards from others, and tries to create the best score.

The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the Austrian Empire (modern-day Slavkov u Brna in the Czech Republic). Austerlitz brought the War of the Third Coalition to a rapid end, with the Treaty of Pressburg signed by the Austrians later in the month.[6] The battle is often cited as a tactical masterpiece&#10;&#10;The game is relatively small, with an 11&quot; x 17&quot; map and 100 counters. The map scale is 600 yards per hex, and each of the eleven game-turns represents one hour. There are four unit types in Battle of Austerlitz: infantry, artillery, cavalry, and dragoon.

The dice show the characters from the comic book Knights of the Dinner Table: 1 = B.A., 2 = Bob, 3 = Dave, 4 = Sara, 5 = Brian and 6 = Hoody Hoo!&#10;&#10;The theme is RPG characters dividing up treasure after defeating a dragon.  The score sheet lists 11 items, with six &quot;voting&quot; blocks for each item.

It's an interesting Yahtzee variant, where you roll the five dice three times on your turn, keeping any faces you want.  You then assign the faces on your own score sheet.  Once a player is done, the next player takes his turn, etc.  When all have gone, start a second round.  The first two rounds are public knowledge: if asked, you must tell how you voted on a given item.  The third round is secret, however.&#10;&#10;After three rounds, count up the votes for each character for each item.  There are tie-breaking rules.

A player can also win if his opponent has no legal moves (since suicides and passes are illegal).&#10;&#10;Games between skilled players will end up temporarily deadlocked, since the square Go board allows a &quot;four corners&quot; configuration where neither side can strongly connect. However, since players can't pass, they eventually must start filling in the internal liberties of their groups. The player who has made the smallest amount of territory will presumably get killed first, so building more territory than your opponent is a secondary (but extremely common) means of forcing a connection and the win.&#10;&#10;So, a gonnect game between similarly skilled opponents unfolds in two stages:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The board-filling stage where opponents race to connect sides until the position is deadlocked.&#10;     The eye-filling stage where opponents must fill in their own eye space or destroy their opponents. &#10;&#10;&#10;Although it shares many of the same tactics as go, some players feel that gonnect has a more interesting opening and endgame than Go. Most Go players, however, feel that the eye-filling stage of Gonnect is tedious, and that the game lacks the simple elegance of Go.&#10;&#10;"

In 2001, Alan Baljeu modified the game into its present form.&#10;&#10;The rules (from Wikipedia):&#10;&#10;&#10;     Black and white take turns placing stones on the line. Unlike Go, this placement is compulsory if a move is available; if no move is possible, the game is over.&#10;     No stone may be placed in a location occupied by another stone, or in a location where a stone of your own colour has just been removed. The latter condition keeps the game from entering a neverending loop of stone placement and capture, known in Go as ko.&#10;     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of enemy stones to no longer have any adjacent empty spaces--liberties, as in Go--then those stones are removed. As the above rule states, the opponent may not play in those locations on their following turn.&#10;     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of your own colour to no longer have any liberties, the stones are not suicided, but instead are safe and not removed from play.&#10;&#10;&#10;Play continues until a player cannot place a stone on their turn.

12182,,"Rather than being a plate-appearance-by-plate-appearance statistical simulation using real players' statistics, like Strat-O-Matic, Brett Ball is a pitch-by-pitch tactical simulation using archetypal players for each team's lineup.&#10;&#10;Each team's lineup consists of an identical selection of 9 batters falling into one of five broad categories: high average, low power, extra speed; high average, high power; decent average, decent power; low average, low power; and (optional) pitcher.  There's also a selection of pinch hitters, one from each category (except pitcher), and a pinch runner.&#10;&#10;The player on defense starts the action by rolling a pair of dice; if the total is between 2 and 5, it's a 'hittable' strike (the lower the number, the easier it is to hit); 6 or 8 (except 4-4) are foul strikes; 7 is an unhittable strike; 8 (4-4 only), 9, and 10 are hittable balls; and 11 and 12 are unhittable balls.  If it's a hittable pitch, the offensive player decides whether to swing; if they do, they roll the pair of dice, and consult a chart to determine the results.  Base runners can attempts steals and (sometimes) advancing an extra base on a hit; the defensive player can call pitch-outs if a runner is on base; and the batter can be made to hit-and-run, sacrifice bunt, or even suicide squeeze.  The usual rules of baseball apply (3 outs to an inning, 9 innings to a game, etc.).&#10;&#10;"

Vessels from the Baltic Sea carried lumber, wool, iron, and hemp while vessels from the Black Sea delivered silk and spices from the Far East.  At the center of it all was the port city of Venice, the &quot;Queen of the Adriatic,&quot; where merchant families earned fortunes from the trade.&#10;&#10;As the head of a Venetian merchant family, you will begin the game with a warehouse and a few ships carrying trade goods.  Sponsor local businesses to manufacture raw goods into valuable luxury goods and sell them to local Aristocraticci for money and favor.  Compete against other families for raw goods and prime real-estate.  Do you place your new draper business in the draper quarter where it will be more profitable, or beside the campo with the beautiful statue to earn your family more prestige?  Raw goods are cheaper at the Pirate wharf, but if the Pirates get enough money, they will set sail and rob everyone's ships of their most prized goods!&#10;&#10;"
