It is no longer just people or nations that are subject to exploitation, but entire planets and moons. As the CEO of one of these mega-corporations, in Charon, Inc. you will vie against CEOs of other corporations as you exploit the planet&rsquo;s resources and colonize Charon, the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto.&#10;&#10;You will stake claims to the various mining regions of Charon, acquire resources for building facilities, use special actions (fair and unfair) to gain advantages over other CEOs, and build your empire to achieve victory in this fast-paced game of planetary domination!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;The board shows Charon divided into several regions. Each round, seed the regions with a mix of gems. Players start with a hand of building cards: at the start of each round, everyone puts one into a common pool. At the end of each round, you get additional cards.Players' bidding flags start out 1 in each of the special power areas. Go around bidding till each player has just one flag unspent. Bid by moving a flag from its space to a location on the board -- in a region, on a border btwn 2 regions, or on an intersection (corner) touching 2-4 regions. After all bids placed, use the special power where your last flag stands -- that is a pretty cool twist, where you have to decide which special power you want to try for (but you only get it if you're alone on that power; or if there's 2 of you in a 5er game!). Then resolve each region: the player with the most flags in/around it wins all the gems. Ties broken by seniority, where a flag is more &quot;senior&quot; if it affects fewer regions (center then edge then corner).&#10;&#10;After all gems collected, players (in turn order) use their gems to build cards from common pool and/or their hand (but may never build cards with same number). May trade gems (3:1?) to get the colors you need, and may only save a limited number of gems from turn to turn. Some special powers change trade ratio and holding limit.&#10;&#10;After 5 rounds, player who built the highest sum of buildings wins.&#10;&#10;"

It is closely related to the game One-hundred and ten (110) also described below.&#10;&#10;The game may have got its name from &quot;forte&quot; which is Latin for strong which describes the 5's in the deck. The origin of this game is thought to be Ireland.[citation needed] In the 1920s, the game became Forte Fives when it moved South into the Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts and New Hampshire with French Canadian immigrants. Today, Forty-fives continues to be very popular in the Merrimack Valley. It is played with a standard deck of 52 cards (sometimes with jokers).&#10;&#10;&#10;Taken from the Article: 45s - Merrimack Valley&rsquo;s Original Card Game - as published in Merrimack Valley Magazine:&#10;&#10;***&#10;&#10;So much about the card game forty-fives doesn&rsquo;t add up.&#10;&#10;If in the right suit, the 5 is the best card, a jack beats a king, and a 2 can be better than a 10 &hellip; but only when it wears black. For the uninitiated, it just gets more confusing from there.&#10;&#10;Even the name of the game is ambiguous. Some say the name forty-fives refers to the four 5s in the deck, others say it has to do with a Canadian version of the game, in which the goal is to reach 45 points (the Canadians call our version &ldquo;120&rdquo;). Then there&rsquo;s the theory that forty-fives is derived from &ldquo;forte&rdquo; &mdash; meaning strong &mdash; the 5 being the &ldquo;mightiest&rdquo; card. And is it written &ldquo;45s,&rdquo; or &ldquo;forty-fives&rdquo;?&#10;&#10;Through all the confusion, however, it all makes sense to legions of forty-fives players around the Merrimack Valley. A game rooted in 19th century Ireland, forty-fives is as popular as ever across the Valley in 2012, whether it&rsquo;s played for fun, in a league, at a fundraiser or even on a computer.&#10;&#10;The following rules summary was taken from www.the45scardgame.com &#10;&#10;Rules (Merrimack Valley Style)&#10;&#10;Objective: Partners try to win tricks and prevent their opponents from doing so. The first team to reach 120 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Scoring: Each trick counts for 5 points, and the highest trump in play is an additional 5. After the hand, each team counts what they have taken. If the bidder's team has taken at least the amount of their bid, they score all they have won. If this team fails, the amount of their bid is deducted from their score. The other team in either case always scores what it has won in tricks.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game: The team to first reach a total of 120 points wins the game. If both teams reach 120 in the same hand, the bidding team wins the game.&#10;&#10;Players: This game can be played with anywhere from 2 to 10 players, but in this version it's 2 vs. 2 (partners).&#10;&#10;Cards: A regular deck of 52. The highest trump is the 5, then the Jack, then and Ace of Hearts (no matter what suit is trump). After that it goes Ace of suit, King, Queen, and then it black it goes 2 through 10 and in red 10 through 2 (both&#10;cases skipping the 5).&#10;&#10;The Full rank in the trump suit is the following; &#10;From highest to lowest:&#10;&#10;Hearts:&#10;5, J, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2&#10;&#10;Diamonds:&#10;5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2&#10;&#10;Clubs:&#10;5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10;&#10;Spades:&#10;5, J, Ace of Hearts, A, K, Q, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10;&#10;The Full rank in off suit is as follows: (the Ace of Hearts is not shown since it is always a trump and always the third highest card);&#10;&#10;From highest to lowest:&#10;&#10;Hearts:&#10;K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2&#10;&#10;Diamonds:&#10;K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A&#10;&#10;Clubs:&#10;K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10;&#10;Spades:&#10;K, Q, J, A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10&#10; Dealing: Each player is dealt 5 cards in batches of 3 then 2. After the initial 3 cards to each player, 3 are dealt to a kitty followed by 2 more to each player.&#10;&#10;Bidding: The bidding starts with the player to the left of the deal and continues clockwise. Each player in turn may either &#10;bid or pass. Bids are made in multiples of 5 up to 30, with the minimum opening bid being 15. No suit is mentioned during &#10;the bidding process until all bids have been made. The highest bidder names the trump suit.&#10;&#10;Drawing: Each player discards as many cards (up to 4) as he wishes from his hand. The dealer then restores each player's&#10;hand to 5 cards, starting with the player to his left. Cards are dealt all at once to each player (no 3-2 method).&#10;&#10;Playing: The bidder makes the opening lead. The hand is played out in 5 tricks. If a trump is lead and you have any trump &#10;cards, you must follow suit.* If an off-suit card is led, any card may be played. A trick is won by the highest trump or the highest card of the suit led if no trump are played.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Reneging exception: The three highest trumps (5, J, Ace of Hearts) have the privilege of reneging when a lower trump is led. For example, if the trump 6 is led, a player holding any of these three top trumps without lower trumps may throw off-suit instead of following suit (if he has lower trump also, then he must play a trump). But there is no reneging a higher trump. For example, if the trump Jack is played, the holder of the 5 may renege, but not the holder of the Ace of Hearts.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Eastern variants stay closer to the beginnings of the game, which featured a number of short-range sliders and leapers, but the power pieces still seem to be long-range. What if long-range pieces did not come to be so dominant? Suppose the short-range pieces of chess' infancy became more powerful by gaining additional short-range moves? Great Shatranj examines some potentials of these pieces, offering 5 different pieces that slide 1 square or jump 2 squares. Each player has up to 8 leapers on the board, giving the game a noticeably different flavor.&#10;&#10;The game is played on an 8x10 board and is played with standard chess rules, except as modified by the specific piece movement rules. Great Shatranj is a short-range Capablanca [actually Carrera] Chess variant.

During the first phase each player participates in a 15 rounds auction to attract Senators to their respective factions. Each Senator awards direct victory points as well as tribunes (paws) in the Senate, where players try to get majorities in the different parts of it. Each Senator also provides a special and unique power to be played only once per game.&#10;&#10;During the second phase the players enter a new 15 rounds auction, bidding for titles of the Cursum Honorum to grant their previously attracted Senators. But it is never so simple, as important senators do not accept but important titles. All the titles provide direct victory points, new tribunes and a special power that sets off when attached to a Senator.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game each player scores their majorities in the Senate and lose victory points for each Senator of their own without an attached title.&#10;&#10;The auction process includes the possibility to play veto cards, that will deeply change the outcome not only of the auction but also of the game.&#10;&#10;"

The two players try to place the wooden blocks on the seesaw determined by dice in order to achieve the victory conditions. There are three rule versions, each aimed at different age groups of children. In the simplest form the player choose an animal block and then rolls the die, the player then places the animal on the colored square in the seesaw that corresponds to the color of the die. The player whose end of the seesaw goes down first wins. In the second version the players first roll a die and then decide which animal to take, thus they need to assess when to use the heavier animals and when to use the smaller. The third and most advanced rules state that the winning condition is for the other players seesaw to be the heaviest (ie. the lighter side wins), making the game more strategic and suitable for older children.&#10;&#10;"

The original edition includes 50 of the all-time great runners and is supplemented by a 2008 Beijing Olympics edition adding 12 more runners, for a total of 62 current and all-time great runners.  Runners include all men's Olympic champions from Charley Paddock in 1920 to Usain Bolt in 2008.  Game includes factors such as fitness, injuries, false starts, weather.  Timing options enables comparison to world records.&#10;&#10;Each race consists of a series of six die rolls for each runner, building on the success (or lack thereof) on each of the prior rolls.  Each runner has a separate rating for the start, 10-30 meters, 30-50 meters, 50-70 meters, 70-90 meters, and the finish, as well as injuries, form, false starts.  Approximately 30 different venues, rated for speed (fast, slow, medium), are included, as are options for a campaign game.&#10;&#10;This is strictly a sports replay simulation game, with no strategy options other than runner and course selection.  Game is published by Owzat Games under license from Lambourne Games.&#10;&#10;Another description:&#10;&#10;At first glance the 100 Metres track event may seem an odd choice for a sports replay game. Around 10 seconds of explosive action, nothing in the way of in-race tactics (if you discount the physiological warfare that takes place as the runners line up and get to their marks, more akin to two boxers eyeballing each other before a fight than to an athletics meeting), no 'decisions' for the replay gamer to make, just pure unleashed speed from starting blocks to tape. But an athletics sprinting coach will tell you differently.&#10;&#10;Each part of the race, and the training manuals usually divide the 100 Metres into four distinct sections, Start, Pick-Up, Acceleration and Maximum Speed, require varying disciplines and techniques, and world-class sprinters all have their strengths and weaknesses, so this is what we have tried to focus on in this simulation, hopefully bringing to life the running characters of some of the All-Time-Great sprinters of the last hundred years. We have extended the training manual concept of four different sections into six, taking the runners progressively to 10m, 30m, 50m, 70m, 90m and 100m and within those six Sections each athlete's ability will vary to re-create his running style. And ability too, we hope. And here we must insert a caveat. In athletics to a degree not applicable to other timed sports performances have improved dramatically as training methods, diets and track surfaces have evolved and here we are trying to compare Charles Paddock with Maurice Green, Jesse Owens with Donovan Bailey.&#10;&#10;To make this simulation 'work' we have had to use a benchmark, time wise, and up-grade the performances of athletes from earlier era to this level of performance. Because we felt that users would want to be able to get close to the current World Record (in the right circumstances with the right athletes) we have geared the simulation to 2001 season performances, assuming in doing so that the great sprinters of the past would have travelled that much quicker with all the (legal) advantages that their contemporary 'rivals' enjoy today. At the end of the day, of course, it is our judgement in all such matters, you may well disagree with that, and we can only say in our defence that we have been as objective as possible after lengthy and detailed research.&#10;&#10;"
