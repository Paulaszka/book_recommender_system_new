Basically the positional shape of the holes is a five times five grid with corners removed:&#10;&#10;&#10;5 ooo&#10;4ooooo&#10;3ooooo&#10;2ooooo&#10;1 ooo&#10; ABCDE&#10;&#10;&#10;The dark player has seven dark shafted game pieces to control. The light player has seven light shafted game pieces to control. Each game piece is formed as a stick which will fit nicely into any of the holes. Each piece has coloured caps at the end in six combinations:&#10;&#10;1.) yellow / orange&#10;2.) orange / red&#10;3.) red / purple&#10;4.) purple / blue&#10;5.) blue / green&#10;6.) green / yellow&#10;&#10;Game rules give the hint that these form a circle of colours. This information might help and can be used to find logical game strategies here.&#10;&#10;The seventh piece being special is&#10;&#10;7.) white / black&#10;&#10;Colour white is used being a 'wild' (joker). It can be used as a legal replacement for any colour mentioned before.&#10;Black is basically a blocker not representing any colour.&#10;&#10;Players take alternating turns. When a game piece is placed in a hole one of the coloured end caps is obviously not visible anymore. Placing a game piece the non visible colour must be announced loudly and clearly enough to the opponent while setting the piece.&#10;&#10;On his first turn a player must place one of his pieces into any free hole. After the first turn a turn consists of one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;1.) Play another own offboard piece into another free hole, or&#10;2.) Turn any one of your already played pieces upside down in the same hole (announcing the non visible colour towards the opponent clearly and loudly), or&#10;3.) Move any one of your played pieces to another hole (but not turning it upside down)&#10;&#10;The object is to get three of the same colour in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) and the first player to do so wins. Since each player's set contains only two caps of each colour (as listed above), at least one of the three-in-a-row might has to be an opponent's piece.&#10;&#10;The 'wild' game piece can only be played as soon as all other six pieces are already set before. This way you can build and win creating a three-in-a-row using own and/or opponent's white game piece as well. The black colour can not be used in a three-in-a-row constellation since it is used as a blocking piece only.&#10;&#10;In general each player can only move game pieces with a shaft of own colour. But any game piece can be used to form the three-in-a-row to win.&#10;&#10;Initially you draw by lot who goes first. In consecutive rounds the previous loser takes the first turn.&#10;&#10;You might find similarities in game play like in Quarto (published in 1991, using opponent's pieces as well to form the winning row) and Memory (published in 1959, remembering the hidden colours is definitively helpful).&#10;&#10;In contrast to Tau the newer Calypso does not include the aspect of a Memory game any longer. The colour which is not visible in Tau (and has to be announced each time) is still visible in Calypso due to the other construction of the game pieces.&#10;&#10;"

Each player has a hand of Gun cards and Run cards. In a two player game each player starts with six Gun cards and six Run cards. During the game the players place one Gun card and one Run card facedown in front of him. The other player does the same. When both players have their cards facedown on the table the player with First Shot reveals his Gun card, while is opponent reveals his Run card. Then compare the cards to ensure a shot can be made. If player A reveals a Head Shot Gun Card and Player B Reveals a Crouch Run Card - the attack from player A cannot be made, the Run card avoids his shot. The play proceeds to player B as he reveals his Gun card to compare to player A's Run card. If player B reveals a Chest Shot Gun Card and player A reveals a Jump Run Card, he jumps into the shot! Player B gets to make a shot and rolls the dice, as indicated on the Gun card.&#10;&#10;After rolling he compares the numbers rolled his Gunslinger card and dishes out the damage to player A!&#10;&#10;Play continues until one or both Gunslingers are dead, with zero health left! The goal of Wild Guns is to be the last Gunslinger standing.&#10;&#10;Looking for a party game? Wild Guns is a great party game and can play with up to ten players.

At the start of the game, findings and discoveries (tiles connected to one colour) are distributed on the site, face up. In a next step, all findings are covered with the dust of time - terrain tiles on top of them, thus creating multiple layers of tiles. Only after this, colours are assigned to the players - hopefully thy remember some of &quot;their&quot; findings.&#10;&#10;Each player plays a team of archaeologists trying to excavate in particular those findings which match his own research assignment (colour). In trying to achieve that, however, fragments of roman documents might be discovered, earning the player additional points.&#10;&#10;At a player's turn, he performs each of 4 actions:&#10;- Move his expedition manager 1 - 3 spaces around the border of the site (to more promising sectors). His position determines the spaces of the site which can be reached by archeologists (neutral colour).&#10;- Now the player has 5 movement points to move one or more neutral archeologists, either to the sector determined by his own expedition manager or to some bad position for the opponents.&#10;- The 3rd action the site is explored. Two terrain tiles with archeologists on them are lifted and the things nderneath are now visible. They are (mostly) not directly available.&#10;- Finally, the player can perform an excavation. To get the several findings visible, you need to place one or more archeologists around the space, depending on the depth of the zone.&#10;&#10;Findings of your own colour are directly put into the museum, more worthy findings are replacing ones with lesser value.&#10;Findings of an opponent`s colour are not that easily excavated. You need allocated points or some dice luck to get them.&#10;&#10;Since mostly a finding is not discovered and excavated in the same turn, players have to be careful not to discover findings, which can be easily &quot;grabbed&quot; by their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player manages to excavate all of his assigned findings (winner of the game). If nobody manages to do so, the  game ends, when a player reaches the end of the &quot;expedition track&quot;, where successful excavations and discoveries are registered, and the player with the most allocated points wins the game.&#10;&#10;The advanced game offers fences to make it harder for opponents to excavates findings discovered by other players.&#10;&#10;"

Townsfolk frequented the marketplace and various goods traded owners.&#10;&#10;The war had its impact on the nation in the 1940's and there was shortage in food as well as other products, which lead to that the range of goods was reduced in stores as well as in the marketplace. Trade in the black market became usual especially when the ration cards were taken into use. The nation recovered in the 1950's and the belief in the future got the trade started once again.&#10;&#10;In the game the players try to accomplish various tasks and bring goods from the market stands to the stores located around the marketplace at the same time as they are looking for the missing whistle of the marketplace guard.&#10;&#10;During the game the players receive rewards for accomplished tasks, such as new skills, which allow them to move on to more difficult tasks. However, the life at the markeplace is not that easy. Good and bad crop years, the rising population, the war, economical success, the belief in the future and different events in the society have their impact on the prices and the players' possibilities to carry out tasks.&#10;&#10;This is an exciting and educating game for 2-4 players, in which local history and the memories of the elderly townsfolk of Vaasa are interwoven into an innovative boardgame.&#10;&#10;The board has two sides, one easier and one harder. The game is suitable for both young and more mature players.&#10;&#10;"

There are 36 picture cards and 50 question cards in the game. The picture cards are placed on the table face up. Then a random question card is drawn (by a player who can read, otherwise the players do not necessarily have to know how to read yet) and a player tries to find quickly as possible one or more cards matching the question card. Usually the question relates to some detail in the picture cards (for example: find as many animals as possible with a tail!). The player marks the found cards with a piece and scores points as shown on a timer (a special timer included in the game). The player with the most points in the end wins.&#10;&#10;"
