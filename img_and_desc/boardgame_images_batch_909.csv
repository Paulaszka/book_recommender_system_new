There are many very good rule sets aimed at a specific period in the hobby which provide a detailed simulation of warfare in that period. These rules have been designed to provide the player with challenges based around the manoeuvre and the management of their units in a quick play format while still maintaining a feel for the period. An army within the game is typically 20 units as side broken down into distinct command groups. A unit is a single base. The rules use 100mm equal to one range/movement unit and a unit has a footprint of 120mm wide by 30mm &ndash; 80mm depth depending the formation and unit type. The rules have been designed to provide capability options at the unit level, while still presenting the dilemma to the player that they cannot complete all the traditional phases (shooting, moving, charging and reforming) during a turn with that specific unit. These rules instead of using a traditional system of very distinct detailed weapon factors and micro-managed movement rates, they provide a game framework that looks at the different unit&rsquo;s capabilities compared to that of the unit&rsquo;s opponents for the period. This enables the player to apply their own knowledge of the historic period to represent the way a specific unit should perform with in the game. The rules also do not use the IGUGO turn approach, but instead each action, (reform, charge, move and shoot) can be done in any sequence and up to twice in a turn. This keeps both players engaged throughout a turn sequence. A unit has a limit of two actions in any turn. The players take it in turns to complete these actions by unit. Also, the rules do not focus on detailed weapon factors and actions within a specific game turn time frame, but use the approach: &ldquo;Was the specific unit any better or worse on the battlefield for the period?&rdquo; For example, all units could have used volley fire, but was this specific unit any better/worse at than anyone else? The rules manage this through a unit being given a selection of capabilities. The rules make a difference between the plug and socket bayonets. This is handled by the unit completing a distinct action to counting them fitted. This means when a plug bayonet is fitted, the unit cannot shoot. This formation is called &ldquo;Foot cavalry defence&rdquo;. This also covers the use the of foot squares as an anti-cavalry defence. The rules have to make a comprise and when a unit is claiming &ldquo;foot cavalry defence&rdquo; they also count as a deep formation even when a unit is in line with bayonets fitted. All units break at the same point, regardless of if the unit is veteran, regular or militia. What is managed within the rule set is how quickly or slowly a unit reaches that point of failure. Generals are used for command and control only. Units must be organised into command groups. An army for the game is organised into a number of these command groups with an overall army commander. Generals can only command units within their group and the army commander can command any units across all command groups. Typically, a command group is a brigade, division or corps depending on the scale you have adopted for the army. Games can be played over a two-hour time limit with a scoring system based around the number of units that one side has managed to kill. The rules reward aggressive play; thus, hopefully avoiding a static game. For a specific historical battle use the objectives of the actual battle to decide the winner. These rules cover the period from the end of the dominance of the Swiss Keil to the end of The Mahdist Wars in the Sudan.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

The goal is to get rid of your cards before your friends &mdash; and do as much damage as you can while you go.&#10;&#10;The deck consists of 96 cards, numbered 0-5. You can play one card higher or lower than the card on top of a play pile, including your on your own pile, and those numbers wrap, so you can play a 5 on a 0 and vice versa. The &quot;0&quot; card is special, though, in that it counts as damage (negative points), counted at the end of the round, so it's best to try to play them on other people's piles while defensively keeping your pile as far from 0 as you can.&#10;&#10;The app is there to tell you when to play, give you random challenges, and generally make your life a panic-inducing nightmare (in a fun way!). The app will randomly (but evenly) assign turn order and occasionally force all players to compete in quick, frantic mini-games on the device &mdash; often when they least expect it.&#10;&#10;The first person to get rid of all their cards and tap the button in the middle of their screen gets the most Space Points, with fewer points being given to each player as they finish. Once all players are done, they are asked to count their damage (cards marked &quot;0&quot;), and then the app will calculate their scores for the round.&#10;&#10;Rounds typically last about 3-6 minutes, and the player with the most Space Points at the end of 10 rounds wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

From September 1939 until the surrender of Japan, the high seas were a global battle zone filled with mighty battleships, nimble cruisers, silent hunters, and flat-tops bristling with planes. Before our eyes, we witnessed the changing of warfare on the high seas as the thunderous old guard fell to air power and submarine Raiders prowled the open waters and the carrier showed its true diversity and adaptability.&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder not only allows players to re-create the Atlantic or Pacific theaters of the war but to see how challenging the entire picture was for their leaders. How do you protect a globe from German raiders? How desperate was it for Britain when France fell and they were left to fight Germany and Italy alone on the high seas? What is the right balance for the Soviet fleet split between four distinct fronts (Baltic, Black Sea, Arctic, and Pacific)? If the Mediterranean force weakens for the allies, from where do they draw ships? Does Japan strike quickly or play for attrition when they arrive on the halfway point? Will America fight in two fronts, three, or four?&#10;&#10;In Seas of Thunder, players will experience the tension of too much sea to cover with too few ships, the frustration of being caught unprepared, or the intensity of a vital stand contesting a high-value sea area. Victory is neither sudden nor guaranteed. In each battle, a flight of Catalinas, the lack of ASW, the improper distribution of air power, or even a missing minesweeper could be the difference between success or failure.&#10;&#10;What's in the Box&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder may not have every ship in the conflict, but it has the ones you know.&#10;&#10;1 Mounted Map (Double-Sided with pre-Pearl Harbor scoring on one side and post-Pearl Harbor scoring on the other)&#10;&#10;1200+ Combat Ship counters (Capital ships down to Destroyer Squadrons, Submarine Grops, and Mine-sweeping Flotillas)&#10;&#10;132 Convoy &amp; Utility counters&#10;&#10;14 Port Cards (1 per side for each of 7 scenarios)&#10;&#10;Combat Sequence Cards for tracking combat&#10;&#10;Plus sundry dice, rules, scenario details...the usual.&#10;&#10;Seas of Thunder is every bit a full-force strategic-level representation of the conflict on the high seas during World War 2. Players have to manage a global disposition of their warships with frequently too much ocean to cover and not nearly enough ships to cover it.&#10;&#10;Each nation has access to the historical ships that sailed in the conflict. Each country's fleets have advantages and disadvantages that are unique to them.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
