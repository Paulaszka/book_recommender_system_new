Players take turns during 4 seasons per year for 4 years, using predetermined commands during each season. Those commands are Move, Deploy, or Attack. Once per year, each daimyo may use one special skill, which amplifies the power of one of their commands. At the end of each year, players tally up their total Castles, Cities, and Fortresses and are awarded Honor based on that total.&#10;&#10;The game is over after 4 years, and the player with the most Honor wins.&#10;&#10;In single player, the board is set up with significantly more troops, and the player must battle through all of them to completely conquer 5 Regions within 4 years. This race against the clock also acts to help players understand the Actions and General Cards.&#10;&#10;Edit: There are now additional multiplayer rules for playing the game out until only one player is left. This is an optional way to play, and makes the game much longer, but is still as strategic and even more desperately gratifying when a long-term plan comes together through alliance, deceit, and careful planning. Another optional rule sets the board up with all daimyo present even in a less-than-8 player game.&#10;&#10;Each faction in the game is asymmetrical, and each has its own 4 special skills, called General Cards. The factions include:&#10;Oda - Beginning in south central Honshu, the Oda clan has powerful General Cards that allow him to wage war heavily and assign his armies to the most crucial battlefronts.&#10;Uesugi - The Uesugi clan's attacks are bolstered by powerful generals, and his tactical movements and deployments insure that his armies are where they need to be.&#10;Takeda - While the mighty Takeda war machine has deceptively light attack powers, their troop movements and deployments make them extremely able to defend their hard-won gains.&#10;Hojo - The Hojo employ shinobi, which allows them to completely fool their enemies. While an enemy may think the Hojo are weak on one front, their armies can immediately arrive on the opposite end of their kingdom, shocking enemies into submission.&#10;Miyoshi - The Miyoshi use deception and surprise tactics to hit their enemies where they're weakest. Their powerful navy insures their ability to suddenly appear on any coast at any time.&#10;Mori - The Mori clan uses cunning to thwart their opponents. Their swift advance through unoccupied territories and their ability to fight on multiple fronts at once make them a headache for any enemy to stop.&#10;Date - The Date clan can assault enemy castles with heroic actions, and their ferocity makes neighboring armies wither. Beware the city of Sendai, as the Date will fiercely defend it.&#10;Shimazu - From the southern tip of Kyushu, the Shimazu wage war with their enemies to the North and East. The Shimazu are supported by the people, who rush to join their cause.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Paraguay entered the war in defense of Uruguay while Argentina allied with Brazil. Uruguay itself, once conquered, switched sides and declared war on Paraguay. Thus was born the Triple Alliance. Despite having a small population, little territory, and few resources, the Paraguayans fought with unexpected tenacity.&#10;&#10;First, they embarked on daring offensives, then they were forced to fight massive defensive battles, taking an unsustainable number of losses. After seven years of arduous fighting, the Paraguayan army participated in its last battle at Cerro Cor&aacute;, the only town left to be conquered by the Alliance. At the last stage of that desperate battle, Paraguayan President Solano L&oacute;pez committed suicide while cornered by Brazilian soldiers. Material and human losses were astronomical on both sides. It is said that more than 90% of the male population in Paraguay died during that colossal war. Even the victorious countries were brought to the brink of exhaustion &ndash; to such an extent that Brazil is, to this day, still in debt.&#10;&#10;Surprisingly, this war has never been represented in a game of its own. It is high time to bring this conflict to the forefront of the wargaming scene, not only so that fans of the genre can have the chance to recreate this conflict and explore different strategies, but also so that the general public can become more informed about such an important historical event in a simple way. For this reason, War of the Triple Alliance prides itself on two basic principles: historical depth and simple rules.&#10;&#10;The War of the Triple Alliance confronts the players with the dilemmas faced by the generals of the opposing sides. Paraguay starts with a strong army that can advance into Argentine and Brazilian territory, but does not have enough replacements to sustain a war of attrition. The allies (Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay) must contain the Paraguayan onslaught and gain time by giving as little ground as possible, because as time goes by their armies will be more and more numerous, and they will be able to present battle.&#10;&#10;There is a moment when the strategy for both sides change completely: when the allied player accumulates enough troops to outnumber the Paraguayans, he begins a race to conquer Asunci&oacute;n and other important cities before the end of the game, while the Paraguayan player will try to slow down his advance or perhaps even stop it by relying on the fortifications that protect the ascent up the river.&#10;&#10;The game incorporates cards to make room for events that, while not strictly military, influenced the course of the war. Players must decide whether to gain immediate benefits in the form of new combat units, or whether to plan their strategy for the long term and prefer to put victory point cards into play or to modify the duration of the game. This increases the variability and excitement of the game, as well as enriching it by adding historical depth. Players have a more detailed explanation of card events in the rulebook.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game will be the one who economizes his forces better, uses his cards better and has been able to manage the timing of the game more wisely.&#10;&#10;The War of the Triple Alliance is a perfect game to enter the world of wargames. The rules are simple and intuitive, specifically designed to avoid tedious intermissions and the battles are resolved in a patterned way so that in each round the players are clear about their options. However, this apparent simplicity does not prevent players from having to make decisions on the edge, and experienced players will find the game very challenging: will the Paraguayan player launch himself southwards, trying to reach the strategic cities of Brazil or Argentina, or will he prefer to send his armies to Mato Grosso in the north, with the aim of completely eliminating a front and getting a good handful of cards that will shorten the game in his favor? Likewise, the Allied player has many decisions to make: Will he have enough temperance to avoid entering a decisive battle before accumulating enough troops? Will he advance along the most direct path to Asunci&oacute;n, storming the fearsome fortifications on the Paraguay River, or will he prefer to bypass them and begin a long campaign of conquest?&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;&bull;    1 double sided (English/ Spanish) 25.6&rdquo; x 19.6&rdquo; game board (mounted)&#10;&bull;    54 cards&#10;&bull;    2 starting cards&#10;&bull;    73 Paraguayan unit counters (including leaders)&#10;&bull;    89 Allied unit counters (including leaders)&#10;&bull;    4 Capital markers&#10;&bull;    3 fortress markers&#10;&bull;    4 victory point markers&#10;&bull;    54 control markers&#10;&bull;    3 red dice, 2 green dice, 2 blue dice&#10;&bull;    1 Battlefield Display&#10;&bull;    1 Rulebook English&#10;&bull;    1 Rulebook Spanish&#10;&bull;    1 Playbook English&#10;&bull;    1 Playbook Spanish&#10;&#10;MAIN CHARACTERISTICS&#10;&#10;&bull;    It only takes 2 hours to recreate this massive conflict.&#10;&bull;    Simple rules make the game&rsquo;s concepts easy to grasp for all types of players.&#10;&bull;    The game&rsquo;s card selection system forces each player to make interesting choices.&#10;&bull;    Quick and intense games with special attention paid to the details of the map and illustrations of the armies.&#10;&bull;    Historical accuracy.

Will you manage to attract more visitors than the other players?&#10;&#10;Pretpark Tempo is a card-drafting game with a unique twist. Cards can be played as an attraction or as a potential visitor.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two phases. The first phase lasts two rounds. Every turn each player chooses two cards form their hand and then pass the remaining cards to an adjacent player. All players simultaneously show which card they play as an attraction, place it in front of them and activate its special ability. All build attractions stay in play in front of each player to form their own theme park. Attractions all have a type and a theme which contribute to attracting visitors in the second phase of the game. The second card chosen is placed face-down in a shared pile which is called &quot;the visitors' row&quot;. All visitors in this pile will make their appearance in the second phase of the game to choose a theme park to visit.&#10;&#10;Whenever one or more players have no cards to pass to an adjacent player - the round ends. A new hand of cards is dealt to each player and a new round starts. After two rounds the first phase of the game comes to an end.&#10;&#10;In the second phase of the game the visitors in the visitor' row are revealed one by one. All visitors have a preference toward a certain theme and type of attraction. Players compare their theme parks to find out who has a majority in attractions that are preferred by the visitor to decide which player attracts the visitor. After all visitors are assigned you count how many visitors came to visit your park and add bonus points for your attractions with certain special abilities. The player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Pretpark Tempo is a contest for majorities. Therefore, it is essential to keep close track of what your opponents are building and make well-considered decisions during the drafts.

To do this, you&rsquo;ll mark off one of the four &ldquo;uses&rdquo; of that piece on the reference side of your play sheet, then you&rsquo;ll fill in the spaces where they piece &ldquo;landed&rdquo; after you &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; onto your playfield from the top edge.&#10;&#10;Every turn - before or ater you place the rolled piece - you may place one &ldquo;at will&ldquo; piece. If you do, mark off the &ldquo;at will&rdquo; dot for the piece you want to place, then drop it on your board like a rolled piece. You may do this once for each of the six pieces. Note that you get a score bonus (up to 21 points) for your unused &ldquo;at will&rdquo; pieces at the end of the game, so choose wisely!&#10;&#10;Once everyone&rsquo;s placed their rolled and at will pieces, roll the die and start a new turn. The game ends when a player reaches the top of the board (the 15th floor) or if you roll the die and that piece has already been used four times.&#10;&#10;Your score is your single highest-scoring floor. A floor scores points equal to its level, multiplied by the number of filled spaces on that level &ndash; if your 7th floor has 9 filled spaces, it scores (7*9) 63 points. You also score a small-to-moderate bonus for unused &quot;at-will&quot; pieces: 6=21; 5=15; 4=10; 3=6; 2=3; 1=1. High score wins; play another turn if tied.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Territory is set in a classical fantasy landscape where there are several tribes exploring the surrounding realms they find themselves in: magnificent and ancient landscapes from a past that is long forgotten. Champions will explore realms, seek out Relics, and cast Spells to combat other tribes in their quest to uncover the mysteries of the realm.&#10;&#10;Players play the game with a deck consisting of Champion cards, Relic Cards, and Spell cards. Players also have a small separate deck called a 'Territory Deck'. The object of the game is to be the first person to get 18 points. Players get points when they destroy an opponent&rsquo;s Territory, Relic, or Champion from play.&#10;&#10;Territory is a turn-based game where players place champions on their Territories and Relics in between their Territories during their turns. Players also may play Spell cards during their turns which help improve gameplay conditions. During a player&rsquo;s turn, in a distinct phase called the &lsquo;Combat Phase&rsquo;, Champions attack their opponents' Territories and Relics.&#10;&#10;"

To blurt out the opposite of the correct answer with no time for thinking. It&rsquo;s harder than it sounds! Who can keep it going the longest and who blanks out completely?&#10;&#10;Game-play: Begin play by choosing one person to read the questions in the first round and one person to answer. The answerer should keep answering one question after another as long as they answer correctly (that is, incorrectly). Answers must come quickly, without hesitation. It's up to the reader to decide whether the answers are fast enough, but a few seconds is a good rule of thumb. Answers that take too long are considered a wrong answer and play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;The reader continues by asking the new answered questions from the same card, picking up with the next question. When all questions from a card have been asked, draw a new card from the pile. A new reader can take over at any time.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest number of correct questions in a row is considered the leader. If another player beats their record, they are now the person to beat. Play for a set number of rounds, and the person with the highest score at the end wins.&#10;&#10;"

Following the US intervention in April, the unit was deployed to &#196;&#144;&#225;&#187;&#147;ng Nai Province to protect the Bien Hoa Airbase. The 173rd was a &ldquo;showcase&rdquo; unit that embodied what was to have been an international effort to combat the spread of Communism in South Vietnam. From the start the unit was engaged in battles with the National Liberation Front&rsquo;s 9th Division for control of the province.&#10;&#10;In November two battalions, one from the 503rd US Airborne Regiment and another from the Royal Australian Rifles, were deployed to once again &ldquo;search and destroy&rdquo; the elusive Viet Cong. The offensive was dubbed Operation Hump, as many of the participants optimistically felt that once this fight was over they would soon be going home. This time, however, the Communists elected to stand and fight as their brethren had done further north earlier at the A Shau Valley. What resulted was one of bloodiest and violent fights to that point in the war, sowing the first doubts among the US and Allied forces that perhaps victory for them was not &ldquo;just around the corner&rdquo;...
