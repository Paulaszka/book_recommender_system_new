For that, he or she builds and sails a fleet of both fishing boats and war galleons, by cleverly using the resources received in the beginning of each play: winds and coins. In addition, each almirante has three opportunities to use a god card.&#10;&#10;Each play starts by receiving 6 winds and a variable amount of coins. Winds allow you to move your vessels: you need 1 wind to sail a fishing boat to another field, and 2 winds to do the same with a heavier galleon. Coins allow you to build new vessels: fishing boats cost you 2 coins, while galleons cost you 8 coins. You can trade these two resources, if you are willing to pay a conversion fee.&#10;&#10;You then move your vessels. Sail your fishing boats to the shoal fields to fish and earn coins on your next turns (2 coins per each of the 6 shoals players compete for). Sail your galleons to meet opponent vessels in order to fight battles, or go for the center to conquer it. Battles are always won by the almirante with the most galleons on that field. Some defeated vessels are sunk and some of them may flee.&#10;&#10;If the time is right, call upon the gods! Each almirante chose 3 god cards from equal pools of 8 before the game started, kept them secret and can now play each of them once - but only once. Play Aeolus and he will grant you extra winds, or maybe play Ares and he will sink an opponent's vessel...&#10;&#10;Your play is now over. Are your galleons dominating the center of the ocean?
