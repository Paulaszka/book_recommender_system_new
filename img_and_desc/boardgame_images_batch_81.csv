9297,,"From the publisher:&#10;&#10;On behalf of the all-powerful pharaoh, the best architects of their time are building pyramids as burial grounds for the divine king. However, a battle between the master builders erupts: who constructs the biggest, most beautiful and magnificent pyramids? Envy and conspiracy are the order of the day and thus the architects make life difficult for each other.&#10;&#10;Each player tries to erect as many high-quality pyramids as possible. The player whose turn it is receives a new building card. He then can swap cards with the other players. He or she may then lay down cards to a pyramid or continue building at a pyramid already in progress. A pyramid is created when it consists of at least two rows of cards on top of each other. Each row consists of building cards with the same number. The row on top always has fewer cards than the ones below. The result is a continuous row of numbers from top to bottom.&#10;&#10;When it's their turn, players have to decide if they want to have their pyramids evaluated. The cards will then be taken away and the number of points marked down. Apart from the building cards, there are &quot;thieves&quot; with whom one can steal cards out of other player's pyramids, &quot;tax collectors&quot; who steal hand held cards and the &quot;pharaoh&quot; who can prevent these actions from taking place!&#10;&#10;"

Well, Goal Line Stand is &quot;Scrimmage done right.&quot;  This is a game of tactical American football played on a hex grid field with each player represented by an individual counter.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is the movement system, which is complex and, IMHO, realistic.  Player counters can occupy a hex center, a hex side or a hex corner (vertex).  Players spend movement points to move forward (straight or diagonally), backward (ditto), or sideways.  Players can be facing in 1 of 12 directions.  However, not all types of movement and facing are possible at all times - it depends upon where the counter is located (hex center, side or corner), and upon the position played and game situation.  Some movement bonuses are available.&#10;&#10;Each player is rated for: mobility, power, blocking, tackling, rushing, running, passing &amp; pass receptions.  Substitutes are available at some positions.  A player may be in 1 of 2 stances: decelerated (as at the snap) or accelerated.  In an accelerated stance, a player can move much farther but has less maneuverability.&#10;&#10;There are extensive rules governing illegal movement locations and player contact.  Blocking, tackling &amp; rushing are resolved (after contact) with percentage dice and a variety of die roll modifiers.  Movement after contact differs depending upon success or failure of the attempt.&#10;&#10;Fake and real handoffs are possible.  Forward and lateral passing (fake and real) is handled in a realistic (and, again, complex) manner.  Passes may be lobs, lofts or bullets - each is handled in a different way for passing accuracy calculations and the chance of a deflection or interception.&#10;&#10;Like Scrimmage, Goal Line Stand ignores the kicking game.  Fumbles and penalties are not accounted for.  Four learning scenarios are provided and, in my experience, are necessary to grasp this unique game system.&#10;&#10;The game still suffers from a problem inherent in the concept - moving each player in 1/2 second intervals means it can easily take an evening to play 4 downs (between experienced players).  That said, it is an interesting play for true football fanatics.&#10;&#10;"

Depending on which action they take, they can then draw colored or black bidding cards.  Finally, at the end of their turn, all players must move a commissioner.  The commissioner&rsquo;s path is tracked, and once they have moved across the map, bidding immediately occurs in the districts the commissioner landed on in that trip.  Players use the bidding cards to bid on a specific lot, and must only use cards of the same color as the lot.  Black cards may be added in to any bid.  The winner can then build their skyscrapers on that lot or declare a building stop.  The player that declares the building stop scores a point for every skyscraper in the district.  Then, the district scores as normal, but the points received are halved.

9375,,"From the Introduction:&quot;The Energy Crisis Game is an instructive introduction to the complexities of energy management. Get involved in the challenge of planning our nation's energy reserves&quot;.&#10;&#10;The Game Equipment consists of the following: a mounted Gameboard; a tri-folded Rules sheet; 1-(6)-sided DIE; 60-Ration Cards; 1-Coupon Disbursement Packet; 6-Various COLOR Ration Coupon Cards; 20-Barter Certificates; &amp; $2,140 in various denominations ($10s,$50s,&amp;$100s).&#10;&#10;The OBJECT of the Game is to Collect(through buying, selling, bartering, or auctioning), one of EACH of the SAME Color Ration Coupons which are portrayed upon their COLOR Ration Coupon Card. There are various spaces on the gameboard which indicate when a Player can: Collect an amount of Money; Sell, Buy, or Choose a Ration Coupon for some amount of money, BARTER with some other eligible Player, Collect another BARTER Certificate, and on the Supply &amp; Demand spaces-an AUCTION will take place with the Player landing there acting as Auctioneer. There are 2 LARGE Sections of the gameboard designated the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; and &quot;Coupon Disbursement Center&quot; with a &quot;canceled Ration Coupons&quot; place for when there are less than (6)-Players participating. On each of the COLOR Ration Coupons Cards, there are (3)Sections denoting INDUSTRY, CONSUMER, &amp; GOVERNMENT requirements.      &#10; To Start the Game, each Player chooses a Color Pawn and a COLOR Ration Coupon Card, which DOES NOT have to BE of the SAME Color as their PAWN, and then picks one of the (4) corners of the BOARD to begin from. The Players are NOT allowed to perform any action depicted in the CORNER space they begin IN.  &#10; Before starting the Game, MIX &amp; place ALL 60 Ration Coupons within the Packet. Then PICK someone to be the Treasurer and then 3 Ration Coupons are picked from the Packet and placed FACE-UP in the Energy Market Section of the gameboard. The Players are EACH given $200 and starting with the Treasurer(banker), randomly pick (5) Ration Coupons from the Packet, placing ANY identically corresponding ones on his OWN Ration Coupon Card. This is performed until EACH Player is left with (5) Ration Coupons in their hand.&#10;&#10;Then the DIE is rolled by EACH Player with the HIGHEST Rolling Player going first, RE-Rolling the DIE and MOVING in a clockwise direction from where they Started, &amp; then performing any Action as dictated by the space they've landed on. This is performed on every TURN so the ORDER in which Players MOVE and CONDUCT any ACTIONS can be different each TURN. When a Player Lands on the Supply &amp; Demand space, they MUST then Auction ALL (3)Ration Coupons one at a time, in the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; and can even participate in the Auction, then the next Player can take their Turn. Once the Auctions are completed, then the &quot;Energy Market Place&quot; is replenished with (3)MORE Ration Coupons picked randomly from the Packet. When a Player lands on a Barter space, he is considered to be the &quot;Head Broker&quot; for any Barter offers. Bartering can only be conducted between the &quot;Head Broker&quot; and another Player as long as THAT Player has a Barter Certificate and once concluded, then a Barter Certificate is given up by the BARTERING Player but NOT the &quot;Head Broker&quot;, and placed back with the &quot;Bank&quot;. The &quot;Head Broker&quot; can listen to ALL eligible offers and even REFUSE them if they are insufficient to his desires. There are further detailed RULES for Auctioning and Bartering contained in the rather concise RULES sheet.&#10;&#10;"

9391,,"Challenger II: Ultra Modern (miniature) wargames rules&#10;               For battle group level games 1950-1995&#10;&#10;These rules I hope balance playability with the complexity of modern warfare and cover the use of most of the weapon systems in use or likely to be used in the next decade.&#10;The sequence of play is designed to give a fully integrated move and fire system between the players and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of Anti-Tank Guided Weapons. The system is akin to many boardgames and once learned flows as quickly as any alternate move system.&#10;This second edition highlights the increasing use of sophisticated fire control systems as well as other electronic aids on the battlefield, the use of many of which are covered by optional rules.&#10;The main difference from the first edition is in the handling of armour penetration, with the increasing use of composite and active armours. Each armour factor on a vehicle is still 25mm of actual armoured effectiveness at QO slope being taken into account in the thickness, but a 0 factor now represents armour upto about 15mm on light vehicles. The penetration value of weapons is however nearer their true value and a new set of penetration tables and effectiveness charts are used. HESH or HEP are not the super round that it appears in some rules, it has a maximum effective engagement range of 800m, after that you need to start lobbing it using the direct area fire rules. Modern infantry fire stresses volume rather than accuracy and I have therefore considered it a form of area fire and combined it on the same effects table as artillery. In this edition I have also taken the opportunity to reduce the infantry scale to that of a section as was done with the companion Firefly WWII rules.&#10;Helicopters are treated as very fast vehicles and are highly effective but fragile anti-tank vehicles, the full range of their capabilities are covered. Aircraft are an important part of the modern battlefield, but I have limited their impact on the game to direct support of ground elements, although with an increased effectiveness over the first edition.&#10;&#10;Wargames Research Group 1950-1985 Rules for Armoured Warfare&#10;Not a Challenger Expansion&#10;1980 Ultra Modern Army Lists and Organisations&#10;1982 Ultra Modern Army Lists and Organisations Second Edition&#10;&#10;1983 Challenger Revised Edition&#10;&#10;1984 Battlezones - Scenarios for the Ultra Modern Period&#10;&#10;1985 Ultra Modern Army Lists and Organistation Volume 1&#10;The Central Front &#10;Nato Warpac &#10;European Neutrals&#10;&#10;1985 Utlra Modern Army Lists &amp; Organisation Volume 2&#10;Middle East&#10;Africa&#10;Far East&#10;Latin America&#10;Intervention Forces&#10;&#10;1986 Digest No. 3 - Challenger / Corps Commander&#10;Engineering Equipment Data&#10;Engineering Lists&#10;Engineering Scenarios&#10;Equipment Data Update&#10;Army List Update&#10;Challenger Rule Amendments&#10;Challenger Close Assault Rules&#10;Coprt Commander OMG Reinforcements&#10;Armoured Recovery Vehicles&#10;The Australian Army&#10;&#10;1988 / 1989 Challenger II&#10;&#10;1989 Digest 4&#10;Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Rules&#10;The Central Front&#10;NATO&#10;Warpac&#10;European Nuetrals&#10;&#10;1989 Digest 5&#10;Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Ruels&#10;Middle East&#10;Africa&#10;Far East&#10;Latin America&#10;Intervention Forces&#10;&#10;1989 Modern Aircraft Handbook - Aircaraft Details &amp; Weapons for Challenger II&#10;1992 Revised Modern Aircraft Handbook - Aircraft Details &amp; Weapons for Challenger II (Ammendments + Challenger 2000 Modificaions).&#10;&#10;1992 &#10;Challenger 2000&#10;1994 Challenger 2000 Modern Equipment Second Edition Part One&#10;1998 Challanger 2000 Modern Equipment Second Edition Part Two&#10;&#10;"

The arrow comes hurtling out of the dark and the sergeant is bowled over backwards by the impact.&#10;&#10;But don&rsquo;t worry folks! The arrow is usually stopped by the sergeants pocket book/Water canteen or photograph of his mother. This is surely the stuff that the Hollywood western is made of - and we hope that this is what &lsquo;Pony Wars&rsquo; is also made of!&#10;&#10;Forget Realism! Throw accuracy to the four winds! We&rsquo;re not playing &lsquo;Once Upon a Time in the West&rsquo; now! Just put on yar yellow neckerchief, mossey out in yer yellow stripped trousers, boot yer Winchester and climb into the saddle.

We used it quite a lot before wargaming became serious). The rules are not legally binding, merely suggestions and you won&rsquo;t find every single situation that may occur in this volume. You may have to make a few decisions yourself. If you don&rsquo;t like the result the rules are giving then change them &mdash; we don&rsquo;t mind. The idea is to enjoy yourself &mdash; do what you will.&#10;The basic concept behind the game is to allow an unspecified number of wargamers (from one upwards) to fight a battle WITH ALL THE WARGAMERS BEING ON THE SAME SIDE (as officers of the U.S. army). Your opponents, the Sioux nation, will look after themselves. The game is ideally suitable for use at a convention where experienced players can teach the rookies (either gamers or the public) the basic rules without any concealed motives &mdash; they&rsquo;re on the same side! Each new command arriving should be allocated to a person picked from the observers, that person taking the name end rank as appropriate to the command. If the character is killed then the player leaves the game. Thus a continually varying client&egrave;le is established.&#10;Alternatively, a small group of wargamers can have a great game. Each takes the name and rank of a number of officers. Any new coming commands are either given to new players (if available) or allocated to one of the existing players. There again, &lsquo;Pony Wars&rsquo; makes a great SOLO GAME! We provide suggestions &mdash; you do what you want!&#10;&#10;The game is designed for an eight foot by six foot table and uses 15mm. figures. There is no reason what so ever why the game should not be adapted for a different size of table&#10;&#10;"

9398,,"From the Intro to the 7th edition rules&#10;The first edition of our original ancient rules appeared in 1969, and their adopted for the British National Wargames Championships of that year. Despite competition from many would be rival sets, succeeding editions have been used in every important convention worldwide since then, and are used by an overwhelming majority of ancient wargamers. Their mechanisms have become a wargames standard used for every conceivable historical period, including some for which WE consider then unsuitable!&#10;&#10;The seventh edition went to the printers in late 1985, and in the seven years since has almost completely taken over from previous editions. Feedback from play by several thousand customers has made it possible to provide free update sheets available in return for a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. A few of the amendments blocked minor loopholes, most clarify meanings and some incorporate goal ideas for improvements suggested and justified by players. All such changes to date are incorporated into the text of this printing of the rule book as Version 7.5.&#10;&#10;Seventh was a revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, change from previous editions. It places much more emphasis on realism, the problems of command, terrain and natural conditions, and seeks to distract players from excessive pre&mdash;occupation with weapon and amour differences important only if &ldquo;all things are equal&rdquo;. It is the function of the general to ensure that things are NEVER equal! We also take the view that a putative difference in weapon characteristics that cannot be shown to have influenced tactics in, or the result of, at least one historical battle is likely to be spurious. The tendency sung rule writers to show off their knowledge rather than produce the simplest realistic simulation is natural but unhelpful.&#10;&#10;The unanimous conclusion of the users is that seventh is far more realistic than other sets and greatly widens the gap between good and poor tacticians. They applaud the end of the &quot;fire work display&rdquo; with units whizzing off in all directions without getting in each other&rsquo;s way the increased mobility out of and the reduced maneuverability in proximity to the enemy the need to take conditions, terrain and the chance of a surprise into account when planning, the way the fatigue rules force a proper use of reserves, the way rebased troops no longer fall over in the box, and not least, the discomfiture of rule lawyers.&#10;&#10;Since its introduction, seventh has been used in the great majority of tournaments around the world, and even passed the fearsome test of the Milton Keynes 36 hour sleepless marathon event. Tournaments normally use the full rules with terrain choice, weather, unusual deployments and unreliable generals without these causing any difficulty or complaint of unfairness. A public demonstration game at Northern Militaire with one player per side each using 3,600 points of 25mm figures on a 6 foot x 4 foot table with plenty of terrain finished with a decisive win in something over two hours. This implies that increased realism has not been achieved at the cost of &ldquo;playability&rdquo;. Gums now play &lsquo;inch quicker.&#10;&#10;The major difficulty faced by players transferring from the previous editions is one of imagination. It DOES help to plan as if you wore commanding a real army rather than trying to analyze the rules to deduce goal tactics. Cannon mistakes are to leave cavalry at the rear of a marching column instead of scouting in front, keeping the general safe instead of in a position to see, letting an unreliable general continue disobedience instead of correcting him, ignoring terrain difficulties when deploying, with consequent traffic jams when moving out, accepting waver tests instead of avoiding then like the plague, deploying front and rear lines too close so that they became entangled, and leaving front line units to become exhausted or be overwhelmed instead of reinforcing or withdrawing then in goal tine. Victory with seventh edition goes to the player who has best learned the skills of real historical generals, not he with most grasp of the minutiae of the rules.&#10;&#10;Finally, although 7th is simpler than its predecessor and much simpler than its rivals, it is necessarily complex and needs large numbers of figures, a full sized table, and two or mare hours to play. For those occasions for which it will not suit, we recommend our other rule set for the period, the very successful &ldquo;De Bellis Antiquitatis&rdquo;. DBA allows much quicker games with far fewer figures on a 24&rdquo; square terrain, incorporates a campaign systen and army lists, and is especially suitable for beginners, the young, jaded elders, large multi-player gases and odd moments&#10;&#10;"

9400,,"Realistic game of modern naval warfare, without getting the player bogged down into too any technical details.&#10;&#10;It is appreciated that modern naval vessels are equipped with highly sophisticated electronics and weapons systems, but their prime object is still to destroy enemy shipping or incoming missiles. It is therefore assumed that Ship&rsquo;s Captains and Gunnery Officers will be aware of the best means to fight off incoming attacks and will use all available missiles and gunnery to its best advantage, as they close to tactical battle range.&#10;&#10;A percentage system has been adopted and therefore a lair of percentage dice will be needed to play the game. The dice -one red (10&rsquo;s) and one white or black (units) are always thrown in pairs (e.g. an 8 on the red dice and a 2 on the white or black dice represents a throw of 82%). All figures in the tables are basic percentage chance of hits or detection, after this has been amended by the tactical factors which may apply, the final score is arrived at. A throw of this percentage or less is sufficient.

Swedish Game Production Combat Series No. 1.&#10;Production qualities are fairly low but the 17&quot; by 12&quot; map is workmanlike in 5 colors and the counters are clear with Swedes in light blue and Russians in green.&#10;The Russians are on the defensive in prepared positions but are surprised by a sudden Swedish attack through the marshes on the flank of the position. The Swedish units are much better than their opponents but there are few of them. The fight is therefore fairly evenly matched.&#10;The Rules use a standard sequence of play of Move, Defender fires, Attacker fires, Melee and then Rally. Losses are taken to attack strength necessitating the use of loss markers but stacking is limited so the stacks do not get too high.&#10;Special rules include Leaders, Pontoon Bridges, Surprise, extra reinforcements etc.&#10;Same rules as Peter the Great by the same Designer&#10;&#10;"

9407,,"Defiance - The Battle of Xuan Loc (11 April 1975) - Combat Series No. 2 - A Vietnam War Game (designer Perry Moore) by Swedish Game Production.&#10;&#10;Defiance - The Battle of Xuan Loc includes a three-color map, 130 die cut counters, typeset rules and charts, and ziplock bags for counter storage. The game achieves accurate simulation by means of special rules like: Close Assault, Cluster Bombs, Off-Board Artillery, ARVN desertion, CRT shifts for Leader and Armor units, Optional 'what if' Order of Battle, Air Support, Artillery Barrages. Also included are a Historical Background and Designer's Notes for full playing enjoyment of this unusual battle of the Vietnam War.&#10;&#10;During the closing days of the 1975 North Vietnamese Offensive, four NVA divisions were pitted against a small ARVN force, dug-in astride the rugged hills near Xuan Loc - a town of 30,000 people located along one of the key roads into the capital, Saigon. Advancing in strength down the coastal highway were the NVA 5th, 6th, 7th and 341st Divisions, massed with artillery and T-54 tanks. Defiantly blocking their way were the ARVN 18th Divisions and 3rd Tank Brigade. The battle which followed was unique in many respects for the Vietnam War, involving units of divisional size, devastatingly effective ARVN airpower and sophisticated US-made CBU-55 Cluster Bombs. For nearly 2 weeks, the ARVN held Xuan Loc and counterattacked against impossible odds. It was an engagement describable only as 'heroic and gallant' on the part of the South Vietnamese defenders, being one of the few places where the ARVN, though outnumbered, stood and fought with a tenacity which stunned their opponents. So epic was the stand of the ARVN that the entire South Vietnamese Army, previously routed, grew confident again. News reporters were flown in from around the world to witness the battlefield strewn with NVA corpeses, repelled in assault after assault with heavy losses. Game Rating (Based on independent test group results): Complexity - Moderate, Balance - 50% - 50%, Realism - 7, Excitement - 9, Overall - 6.5, Play Time - 3-4 hours.&#10;&#10;The end of the Vietnam War - April 1975. The US have pulled out and the South's armies are crumbling before the North's advance.&#10;The components are functional with a 17&quot; by 12&quot; map and about 100 counters. The map is in 4 colours and shows the area around Xuan Loc including Bien Hoa Airbase. The counters are light green for ARVN and dark green for NVA. each counter is a Regiment or Brigade.&#10;The rules are detailed and cover most aspects of modern war without getting too complicated. Special rules include Leaders, Headquarters, Fortifications, ARVN Desertions, Cluster Bombs etc. &#10;From the Designer's Notes: the game &quot;is truly a slugfest. Both sides have a road to victory.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Players discard cards until a mouse card is discarded.  The mouse card has one to three paw prints on it and the following player discards that many cards.  If one of them is a cat card then the player who played the cat card earns a mouse chip and puts the entire discard pile at the bottom of his card pile; otherwise the player who played the mouse card gets the discard pile (but not a mouse chip).&#10;&#10;

To achieve this it was necessary to generalize certain areas for the sake of playability this, whilst not giving absolute realism (which can never be achieved in a game), resulted in a very fast and enjoyable game. The rules are not designed for a single ship v. single ship combat, as it was considered &ldquo;highly unlikely&rdquo; that in any future Warpac/NATO conflict a solitary NATO ship would come across and fight a solitary WarPac warship. The more likely course of events 1s for the WarPac (Soviet) navies to sail (by devious routes) to prearranged rendezvous points several days before hostilities are due to commence. From there the &ldquo;Task Forces&rdquo; prime function would be to disrupt the American reinforcement of Europe; to intercept and destroy the Vital oil cargoes in the Arabian Gulf, off the African coast and in the Indian Ocean; to prevent the transfer of allied warships into and out of the Mediterranean, and to harass the US Pacific Fleet (with the idea of drawing forces from the Atlantic to keep the Pacific Fleet &ldquo;in being&rdquo; to counter any threat in the Pacific) A further option open to the Soviets would be to use the obsolete Kynda class cruisers to bombard US coastal cities with their long range missiles, compelling the US to keep back warships to protect their own coasts.&#10;&#10;In any of the above scenarios the Soviets would use their ships &lsquo;en masse&rsquo; to achieve their objectives. It was with those actions in mind that these rules were written, to enable the Wargamer to fight through the Atlantic convoys, to endeavor to keep the oil flowing or to fight for the glory of the revolution and crush the wicked capitalists (even if it costs you your life comrade). It is hoped that the users of these rules do know something of modern warships and win use this set as the basis of a campaign involving a number of wargamers as it is only when there are large numbers of ships involved that the maximum enjoyment can be obtained.&#10;&#10;Scale&#10;1 move = 2.5 minutes&#10;1 inch = 1km&#10;2mm/turn = 1knot&#10;&#10;"

The active player has ten pairs of cards face-down in front of him.  He picks up cards and listens to other players perform the sounds depicted on the side that he cannot see.  With every second card picked up he either receives a negative point for drawing an unmatched pair or gets to pick up a matched pair.  Play shifts to the next player once all of the cards have been picked up.&#10;&#10;
