The board is composed of 24x32 squares (18mm) (on a folded A2-sized map) and portrays the geography and transport system of the time. One player assumes the role of Confederate President Jeff Davis and deploys the gray armies (represented by numbered gray cardboard squares) to defend the new Confederate nation. The other player assumes the role of Union President Abraham Lincoln, and deploys the blue armies (represented by numbered blue cardboard squares) in an attempt to crush the rebellion and recapture Confederate territory and cities.&#10;&#10;Players take turns to &ldquo;move and fight&rdquo; as they manoeuvre their armies around the map. The game begins in the year 1861 and has the potential to continue until the end of 1865. Each year is made up of 4 Game Turns (except for 1861 which has only 3 Game Turns) with games typically taking 2-4 hours to complete. Victory points are awarded for winning battles, destroying armies, capturing towns and achieving specific objectives. The Victory Point Ladder shows who is winning at any stage of the game. A player wins the game by garnering sufficient victory points or achieving a winning objective such as occupying their opponent&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;The game fits into a slim, lightweight white plastic A4 box colourfully decorated. The box contains a folded map, blue and grey numbered army pieces, 3 game charts, a die, round town markers, a 20 page comprehensive rule booklet and a 3 page &quot;Let's get started&quot; rule booklet. Access is also provided to information regarding: strategy and tactics, the historical basis behind the rules and the map, the thinking behind the game's design and suggestions for optional rules to enable players to create more challenging game variants. For example,turning the army markers upside down creates a &quot;fog of war&quot; where although players can see their opponent&rsquo;s armies, their strengths are concealed. Historical and geographical accuracy has been attempted, however, no prior knowledge of the civil war is needed to play.&#10;&#10;Specific features of the game include: ease of play, the game feels like an elaborate version of checkers / draughts played out over complex terrain. The blue Union armies can engage in sea-based movements to launch invasions. The game is sufficiently flexible as to allow experienced players to adjust the basic rules, eg to change movement allowances or army strengths to make games more challenging.&#10;&#10;"

You are a politician who tries to gather enough money and influence to become the next president. Of course, you depend on the work of others to get the needed influence. You start with a set of 10 cards (7 of them are &quot;fatherly friends,&quot; which give you 1 money each and 3 of them yield 1 influence each (VPs)). Each round you draw 5 cards from your deck and use one card for the turn order to place your workers. The workers go to the different offices in the government building to buy new cards for you, get influence or to carry out other actions. Each round there is one more space in which you can choose to place your workers. On the game board is a row of cards which you can choose to buy and each round the empty places in this row are filled from a deck of cards divided into 4 different &quot;Ages.&quot; The last cards of the deck are Doctoral degrees which you can buy with your money; these give you 1 VP for each unit of money spent.

It is a 2 or 3-player game and can be played with a Series: Shibumi set. The winning conditions vary slightly for the 2 and 3-player games; however, the game play is the same for both versions.  Naturally, team play is also possible.&#10;&#10;At game&rsquo;s end, a pyramid of 29 marbles is created, which resembles an Inca temple. The peak level is not used.&#10;&#10;The board starts empty. Players choose a color and take the corresponding marbles. Player turns proceed clockwise. Herein, the order is assumed to be White, Black, and possibly Red.&#10;&#10;Starting with White, using the phase order below:&#10;1.    A player may move any free marble on the board to any adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) hole or 2x2 platform which is on the same level as the marble.&#10;&#10;A free marble is any marble that does not support two or more marbles in the level above it, and will not cause to move any marble that was moved or placed on the previous player&rsquo;s turn. This includes tumble-downs. And,&#10;&#10;2.    A player must place one of his or her marbles on any empty space or 2x2 platform on the board. This completes the player&rsquo;s turn.&#10; Any marble that was relocated, tumbled down or was placed is temporarily locked for the following player&rsquo;s turn. The virtual Shibumi Sandbox implementation at  igGameCenter at http://www.iggamecenter.com/, has moved marbles marked with a plus sign. Nice and convenient. For physical game board play, players will have to keep tract of their last moves by recording them.&#10;&#10;When the Inca temple is completed, each player sums the sizes of the smallest of his or her connected groups on each of the four faces of the pyramid. Each of the four faces will yield only one number. For example, if on one face of the temple, a player had group sizes of 1, 1 and 3, the player would only score 1 for that face. The marbles on the pyramid&rsquo;s rising edges are considered part of both of the adjacent faces making them strategically important because they are potentially counted twice!. However, an isolated edge marble can ruin a player&rsquo;s score.&#10;&#10;For a 2-player or 4-player game, the player or team with the highest sum wins. If there is a tie, remove the outer faces to reveal the inner pyramid. The player or team with the most marbles in the inner pyramid wins the game.&#10; For a 3-player game, the player with the highest sum wins. If there is a two-way tie, the player with the lowest sum wins. If there is a three way tie, remove the outer faces to reveal the inner pyramid. Players score the inner pyramid by counting all their visible marbles once each. The player with the highest inner total wins. If there is a two-way tie for the inner totals, the player with the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;"

The game was designed during the 2010 Global Game Jam in Philadelphia, PA. last year's theme was &quot;Extinction&quot; so we decided that the English language has been deteriorating rapidly so we needed some new words. Being big fans of party games we wanted to make a social game, hence the three player minimum. After almost a year of play-testing and messing around with the mechanics we really want to print this game and get it out there.&#10;&#10;What comes in the initial deck?&#10;&#10;The deck comes with a box with instructions printed on the back. 108 cards in the deck. 12 cards are the decision cards (hopefully to be replaced by DICE) 94 cards that each have two word parts listed on either the yellow or orange side. The final 2 cards are our special thanks and stuff like that cards.&#10;&#10;How do you play?&#10;&#10;LangGuini is played by one player being selected as the first to deal/judge. The player selects from one of the 12 decision or &quot;dice cards&quot; (hopefully to be replaced by DICE if we get enough pledges) to find out how many word parts and what color(s) will be used. After selecting from that portion of the deck the dealer selects the word part cards and uses the parts to spell out a word of their own design. After laying out the cards the dealer pronounces the new word for the other players to hear. Then in clockwise fashion the players explain what they think is the definition of the word. After all players define the new word the dealer becomes judge and decides who wins that round. The winner keeps the cards that were used and then takes the role of dealer/judge until they pick a winner and so on. The player who wins XX (number of cards, we play to 15 usually, take a break and start again) WINS the game.&#10;&#10;"

A peaceful victory with propaganda bonuses is the preferred outcome for either side.&#10;&#10;Be the first super power to place their Event Marker onto the Victory space at the end of the Event Track before the opposition and before the DEFCON level reaches one.&#10;&#10;Rules summary.....&#10;&#10;1. Roll for initiative. Both sides roll a single 6 sided dice the highest score wins initiative for that turn.&#10;&#10;2. Place Agency Focus Marker. The winner of the initiative roll chooses one of the four Agency Focus Actions at the top of his side of the game board and moves his Agency Focus Marker from its agency home space to the chosen action space. These bonuses are added to the Spy Dice rolls in the next part of the turn where a score of 5 or 6 is deemed successful. The player that lost initiative then chooses his action (he may not duplicate the action chosen by the winner of initiative for that turn) and places his marker.&#10;&#10;3. Roll Spy Dice. Both sides roll all of their available coloured Spy Dice. Dice that have been placed within the Kremlin or The White House during previous turns may not be rolled again and remain where they are until the end of that round. On turn one both players will have 3 dice to roll.&#10;&#10;4. Agency Focus bonuses are applied. The chosen Agency Focus Bonus is applied to any one of the rolled Spy Dice, starting with the player who won initiative in step one.&#10;&#10;5. Spies infiltrate places of power. Successful spies (those dice that scored a roll of 5 or 6 with any bonuses applied) are deemed to have successfully infiltrated their chosen place of power i.e. Kremlin for U.S. spies or The White House for soviet spies and are placed into the appropriate area on the game board.&#10;&#10;6. Repeat steps 1 to 5. These steps are repeated 3 times or until either player has placed all 3 of his spies into the appropriate spy placement area. The first player to do this is deemed the winner of that round and moves his Event Marker one place closer to the Victory space. Players must raise DEFCON level by 1 if indicated by text above event track. If both players fail to place all 3 of their spies into their appropriate spy placement areas then an intelligence stalemate is declared and the DEFCON Marker is raised one level.&#10;&#10;7. Return Spies and Agency Focus Markers. All 3 Spy Dice are returned to each player and the Agency Focus Markers are returned to their Agency Home Space ready for the next round.&#10;&#10;8. Repeat steps 1 to 7 until one side places their Event Marker onto the Victory space and reads the printed outcome or until the DEFCON level reaches one indicating the start of a worldwide thermo nuclear war and both sides lose.&#10;&#10;"

Some ('straight') cards move a piece forwards so many squares, other ('bent') cards mean the piece must make a 90 degree turn as part of its move. Three special cards exist: '69' can be treated either as a straight six or a bent nine; '8' allow two pieces to be moved a combined total of eight spaces forward; and '1' allows a piece to move one square forwards or sideways. Opposing pieces not on safety square which are landed on are 'bumped' off onto an unfavourable start square.&#10;&#10;The main game involves dealing out the deck between the players who can then pick which card to play each turn. If the game has not finished, the discards are shuffled and dealt again. A version for children involves picking cards at random to play each turn.&#10;&#10;"

Each round is played as a 5-on-5 battle.&#10;&#10;The collectible aspect comes in the form of different Slingers and different medallions (both battle and power boost) &ndash; all in various levels of rarity.&#10;&#10;"

After the 1st game, the winner of the previous game goes first.  Play proceeds clockwise.&#10;&#10;Begin the Game: Place all dinosaurs in the Dino-Bath.  Roll 1 die and go forward the spaces indicated on the die, then follow instructions on each of  the rocks.  There is only 1 die used in this game.&#10;&#10;Only one dinosaur can occupy any space on board at one time.  The only place that more than one dinosaur is allowed to occupy, is the Dino-Bath.&#10;&#10;Dino-Bump: When you land on a space that is already occupied by another dinosaur, that dinosaur goes back to the Dino-Bath and your dinosaur stays on that space.  This move is called a Dino-Bump.&#10;&#10;On a Safe rock, however, you are safe from a Dino-Bump.  See additional rules for Safe rock.&#10;&#10;How to Win&#10;&#10;The first player to enter the Dino Cave is the winner!   You can only enter the Dino Cave with an exact roll of the die.  If you roll a number that is greater than the number needed to enter the Dino Cave, do not move forward.  Wait until your next turn and try again to enter.&#10;&#10;The rule is different, however, for the last Dino Jump rock.  From here, if you roll a 1, then you enter the Dino Cave.  If you don&rsquo;t roll a 1, then go back number on die.  See additional rules for Dino Jump rock and Last Dino Jump rock.&#10;&#10;"

The game's theme calls to mind constellations and stellar navigation.&#10;&#10;Utara makes use of several dice that in each face says either North, East, South, or West. The fifth face has a Sun and the sixth face is Moon. You can use any number of dice to play, with a minimum of ten dice per player. More dice will allow higher scores, possibly longer games and require more space to play.&#10;&#10;Give the playing surface directions, meaning north, south, east and west. Players roll their dice on the playing surface at the same time. Pick one player to start randomly. The player chooses a die with a cardinal direction in it, and moves it in the direction of its face up. When meeting another dice, collect it and change directions to match the new dice face. Continue in this manner until you go out of bounds. Then the next player does the same thing and so on.&#10;&#10;The game ends when no more North, East, South or West dice remain. Each player scores one point for every die in their collection.&#10;&#10;It is best to play a few rounds of Utara, once for each participating player. The player who had the fewest points in the previous round should take the first turn in the next round, so they have an opportunity to catch up. Points are tallied over a series of rounds to determine the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Designer David G. D. Hecht describes it as gentle, and fairly short game.&#10;&#10;18PA includes 16 companies, including local companies, land grant companies, and public companies with different rules for managing them. Rules include merger of small companies to NYC, mining city with mining rights, public companies acquiring local companies, and land grant companies profiting from building of tracks.&#10;&#10;(DGDH edit, 22 January 2014)&#10;&#10;The game now has seven major companies, of which six start as 5-share companies and the seventh--the NYC--forms as a 10-share company by merger at the start of phase 4. The land grant rules have been almost entirely eliminated, except that four of the six companies available at the start have a doubling token, similar to the ones in Bill Dixon's 1850.&#10;&#10;There are also nine smaller companies which are a hybrid between privates and minors. Three of them are the predecessors of the NYC, and the remaining six can merge with any connected company, again after the start of phase 4.&#10;&#10;"
