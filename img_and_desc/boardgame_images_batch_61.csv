Your mission is to shoot down your opponent's two aircraft. You are fully armed with missiles and cannons. But your opponent is equally prepared. Plan each move carefully to avoid being hit.&#10;&#10;Fly to the left, right or straight to get in position to fire on the enemy. Once you're locked in on a target, fire away. A hit will cause damage to the plane or may disable it completely.

This lit the fierce anger of the Big Shadow, that made the world fall into the prison of the eternal alternation between light and darkness, and destroyed the Tribe. But the shaman escaped the vindicative rage and painted on a sacred and inviolable rock, with few primitive signs, the secret to win the dark power of the Big Shadow.&#10;Many and many ages are passed since then. Six glorious Predestined tribes, heirs of the ancient Tribe, decide to face the challenge with the Big Shadow. Their names: Tralon, Orgos, Ab-Diar, Naum, Zark, Groden.&#10;Now, you are the chiefs of those tribes. You have to reach the sacred rock, find the Ancient Sequence, transmit it to your Shaman and defeat the Big Shadow, with great honor. But the path for the sacred rock is long and dangerous. Right outside the village you'll wet yourselves in the Circle of the River of Life, where you can get the gifts of the Language, but you'll have to fight the Salamanders and the Rages, moved by the Big Shadow, to be able to get to the successive Circle, the Land of Chaos. Here you'll be lit with the ancestral frenzy, you'll fight with spears and hatchets the chiefs of the other tribes. Only if you were brave you'll be able to go to the Circle of the Initiation Sea, where you'll learn how to communicate with other tribes. With this you'll finally have completed your Table of the Language and you'll be able to enter the Final Circle: the Knowledge. Here, if you won't get burned by the fire of knowledge, you will be able to read the Ancient Sequence, go back to your village, say the remembered formula and, if it correct, win the game.&#10;But warning: the Big Shadow will try every path to stop you or even win the challenge by covering the whole Circle of Knowledge with its dark presence.&#10;&#10;As you have read the game is divided in several parts, each of which has a different objective, that, when reached, will allow players to go to the next part. One of the player is the Big Shadow, and plays against all the others.&#10;Pretty nice but very long game with few standard mechanics and well made components.&#10;&#10;"

There are about 100 cards, each with 6 words on it, one placed vertically, the others horizontally (crossword-like). The players each take one card secretly. On their turn, they can ask the opponent for a letter. As answer they get all occurrences of this letter in a coordinate system, just like the one of &quot;Battleship&quot;. Then the next player can ask a letter. If they think, they know some words, they can guess them before asking for a letter. If correct, they can guess another word, until they are wrong or decide to ask for a letter. To help the players, all words on one card are related to the same theme. The first player to find all words on the opponent's card gets as many points, as the difference to the number of correct words the opponent has found out is, e.g. if the looser has found four words, the winner gets two points. Play proceeds until one player has ten points.&#10;&#10;The English version of the game is called Battle Words. It was published by William Maclean's Games.&#10;&#10;"

The major varieties of Preference are Croatian, Austrian, and Russian and there are variations of each as well.  Generally a three player game, a fourth player can play by having the dealer of each hand sit out for the round.  Following is a brief description of the Croatian version of the game, and below are links to rule sets for the Croatian, Austrian, and Russian versions.&#10;&#10;Each of the suits has a predetermined value:&#10;Leaves = 2&#10;Bells = 3&#10;Hearts = 4&#10;Acorns = 5&#10;&#10;The dealer deals out all 32 cards - 10 to each player and 2 to the &quot;talon&quot; (crib).  Each player in turn bids one of the suits for trump, or can bid the value 6 game where the declarer(bid winner) can attempt to take no tricks and the other two must try to force him to do so, or the 7 game where there is no trump suit. The highest bid becomes the declarer, takes the two cards from the &quot;talon&quot; and discards two, and then must take 6 tricks to succeed in the game he bid for or a higher one.  The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.  If only one player is opposing, he may request the aid of the other non-declaring player in an attempt to make the declarer fail in his bid, but takes all the bonuses or penalties for doing so.  Non bid hands means a double scoring round in the next hand, and &quot;kontra&quot; may be offered to double the stakes of a hand a player is confident in making the declarer fail (and can be &quot;rekontra&quot; and &quot;sukontra&quot; or doubled and doubled again and again!).&#10;&#10;The players start out with a set number of points (usually 100 each) and the game goes until the total of all three players equals zero.

They routinely ignored pretty much everything having to do with astronomy, physics, and mathematics, and since my background is technical I found that hard to swallow. The main problem with just about every science fiction game I ran across was too much fiction and not enough science. We put a lot of hard science into the system's design, simplified as much as possible to be playable, to try to put some of the science back in, rather than having it just fiction.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

As leader of a tribe of Java Men, can you gather enough food to keep the tribe alive? Can you conjure up good medicine to make the tribe grow? Can you avoid natural disasters and the depredations of other hungry tribes? And, if the answer to all these questions is &quot;yes,&quot; can you persuade the tribe to let you try? Find out now; play Java Man.&#10;&#10;Java Man features die-cut counters, four-color map, rules booklet and player record sheets packaged in a rugged, 4-mil zip-lock bag. Send check or money order for $5.00 per copy, or ask your local retailer for Java Man.&#10;&#10;From the game's back-cover blurb:&#10;&#10;Java Man is a simulation game of tribal politics and survival in the pre-historic, pre-agricultural, pre-civilized era. Each player attempts to control a single tribe, to ensure the survival of his tribe, and to boost it along the road to civilization. Towards this end, players work to control the normally random movements of their tribes across a hexagon grid representing a typical area of the pre-historic world, so as to avoid or destroy hostile tribes, contact friendly tribes, and gather as much food as possible.&#10;&#10;The success or failure of previous actions influences a tribe's willingness to obey a leader's orders. Tribes may be ordered, among other things, to go on the warpath against other tribes, to strip the immediate area bare of food, or to conduct mystic rituals, which may have dire results. A unique aspect of this simulation is that, theoretically, a player may win by ordering nothing at all. Of course, victory is more likely if the leader seizes control of the tribe and leads it boldly into the future... or perhaps into a tar pit.&#10;&#10;"

Comito's comments in the rulebook: &quot;A game is one man's view of a particular subject, and is only as good as the author's research and experience. I designed this game from the viewpoint of a professional soldier who has spent 6+ years in the infantry, including two combat tours, and who has been an instructor in small unit tactics and map reading. My training has been in all aspects of infantry combat, and my research has included not only books but interviews with combat infantry veterans of WWII . . . The game is, honestly, an attempt to combine a miniatures game and a boardgame together. Most of the rules are written from a boardgame viewpoint, but can be readily applied to miniatures.&quot;&#10;&#10;"
