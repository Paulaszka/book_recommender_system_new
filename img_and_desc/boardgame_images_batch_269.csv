The first step is to set out your equipment and select a person to be Banker. The Banker pays off all bets for any agreed number of plays or time limit at the completion of which another player acts as Banker.&#10;All numbers on the layout do not have to be sold. For example, only two or three people may participate in a single play. The profit percentage is exactly the same as if all numbers were covered. &#10;When all bets are down on the layout, the Banker gives the cage a turn which raises and drops the dice at the opposite end of the cage. The three numbers on the top surface of the dice are the winners. &#10;If a bettor's number appears on one die he receives the return of his stake plus a like amount (even money). If it appears on 2 dice he is rewarded with the return of his bet plus twice the amount bet (2 to 1). Three like numbers rewards the players with thrice the amount bet plus the bet (3 to 1).&#10;Lowe's CHUCK-A-LUCK is an exact duplicate of the regulation casino game.

By applying influences and manipulating controls over the various factions, they attempt to pave their way to victory in order to attain the high office of the tribune.&#10;&#10;From the mind of the highly acclaimed designer of Die Macher, Karl-Heinz Schmiel, the gameplay in Tribune  is a combination of worker placement and set collection.  Each round, the players take turns by positioning their followers on the board to garner cards, achieve objectives, and/or attempt to take over factions.  In order to gain control of a faction and to utilize its benefits, one must play a set of cards from that specific group.  That person will remain in command of the faction until someone else stages a successful take-over by having another set that is either of higher quantity or higher sum of values.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved when a player has met the required number of objectives as specified on the victory condition card selected at the start of the game, which is dependent on the number of participants.  Alternatively, you can choose to forego the use of a condition card and play with the point-value option.  In this variant, the game ends when someone has collected a certain number of the faction markers, and the winner is the one with the highest scores as determined by the points assigned to each achievement.&#10;&#10;"

Mechanics are like Monopoly, but the curious thing is the topic... Players are dope dealers trying to buy and sell all kinds of drugs and at the same time they have to avoid police.&#10;&#10;This board game is set in an underground fantasy world. It concerns the buying and selling of so-called &quot;soft&quot; narcotic substances. The aim is to be able to pass the &quot;go&quot; with 2 &quot;Charas&quot; pawns, in a complex circular path by amusing vicissitudes and it won't be easy because, in addition to the other players who have the same objective, they will have to deal with the Police who monitor the game path.&#10;&#10;"

Every player gets a Hat Card, 5 (random) Craft Cards, and 3 Bravo Chips. The Heckle Cards are placed in the middle of the playing area, and the StoryTimer is handed to the player who is going first.&#10;&#10;The game starts with the first player reading aloud one of the 53 included storylines. There are three phases to play:&#10;&#10;Phase I: StoryTelling&#10;The player holding the StoryTimer creates (speaking out loud) the next part of the story (typically a sentence or two). Play moves around the table, with each player creating and speaking a new addition to the story. During this time, if a StoryTeller uses one of the elements on your Craft cards, you place it next to your Hat Card. Bravo Chips can also be tossed to StoryTellers who do a particularly good job.&#10;&#10;Phase II: Discussion&#10;Anyone who played a Craft Card points it out to the others. If no one object, it goes on to that player's Hat Card and will be a point at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Phase III: Recitation&#10;The player holding the StoryTimer gives a Recitation of the story so far. Other players can toss Bravo Chips for a Recitation well done. The StoryTimer is passed to the left, everyone draws back up to 5 Craft Cards, and we go back to Phase I.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players vote to assign awards (most creative, most hilarious, most surprising, most dramatic). These go into the recipients' hats.&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the most points in his or her hat.&#10;&#10;A couple notes about the cards are in order. Craft Cards contain elements of the StoryTellers Craft, which means that players score points by either using or recognizing good storytelling. There are also Heckle Cards which are common to everyone and can be tossed to stop things from getting out of hand.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.liveoakgames.com/storytellers&#10;&#10;"

Studying the &quot;personal description&quot; given by the dice in the tumbler, you can help Paul track down the crooks in a thrilling chase. Who will be the best assistant policeman and the quickest at catching the right crook?&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a game in Haba's range of tumble-dice games, which include dice inside a sealed tumbler with a clear plastic dome. This game has 3 six-sided dice, two of which are essentially D3s, with 3 different faces repeated once. There is a die with dots (1, 2 or 3 dots), a colour die (yellow for the beach, green for the park and blue for the town) and a crook die (Policeman Paul, a chubby crook, a woman crook [on 2 faces] or a crook with a loot bag[on 2 faces]). Besides the dice and the rules, there's a large wooden piece representing Policeman Paul and a deck of 27 cards, showing all possible combinations with crooks of the three dice.&#10;&#10;The 27 cards are placed face up on the table around the Policeman Paul piece. A player shakes the tumbler. Depending on what the dice in the tumbler show, players try to claim the corresponding cards on the table. If the crook die shows the Policeman Paul face, the other dice are ignored and players try to grab the Policeman Paul piece - the successful player gets to choose any card on the table and place it in front of himself. If the crook die shows a crook, the players try to cover with their hand the card showing the corresponding number (on the die with dots) of that kind of crook in the venue specified (by the colour die). Players can only use one hand and the player who successfully covers the correct card with his hand gets to place the card in front of him. Players who wrongly grab Policeman Paul or cover the wrong card can make no further attempt to claim the right card that turn. Cards in front of players can be captured by other players if the same combination of dice get rolled again.&#10;&#10;The first player to claim five crook cards wins.&#10;&#10;"
