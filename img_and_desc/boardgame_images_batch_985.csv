It is playable as a stand alone game or used in combination with the original Ecologies card game. Designed by a biology teacher, the game includes 77 unique organisms, 7 biomes, and beautiful vintage Victorian art. (108 cards total). Gameplay is rooted in authentic science, as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students. While it is scientific enough for the classroom, it is also strategic enough for any game night.&#10;&#10;This game is a sequel AND an expansion. When using the game as an expansion, you can customize the deck to include cards from both games, including cards you love and excluding ones you don&rsquo;t. Some players love aggressive &ldquo;take that&rdquo; mechanics, while others find them stressful. Some players love particular healthy ecology bonuses, while others feel they are overpowered. With multiple decks, you can create a customized experience to fit your group. If you&rsquo;d like to maintain the same game length and feel, we recommend choosing 10 factor cards and 7 different biomes.&#10;&#10;Players build and maintain food webs in diverse environments. Healthy ecologies reward you with bonus powers and perks. Watch out though, as others may decide it&rsquo;s easier to disturb and degrade your ecosystem than nurture their own.&#10;&#10;Cards are arranged with plants on the bottom and predators on top. Players negotiate trades and use biotic and abiotic factor cards to affect their webs and the webs of players around them. It is a race to get to 12 victory points, with players using different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or disrupting other ecologies.&#10;&#10;The points system is based on ecological trophic levels. The producers (plants) are worth less and as you make your way up the pyramid organisms are worth more, as it takes a lot of energy to sustain them. In real life only roughly 10% of the energy makes it from one level to the next, meaning you have to have acres of land and hundreds of animals just to sustain one apex predator.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The theme is one of breaking in to a security system via lockpicking and computer hacking. Designed for the Looney Pyramids family, Lockpick requires a Zark City deck (or other five-suited deck from with values from 1-13), 15 pyramids in five colors, and two dice: a standard D6 and a specialized color die.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the card deck is separated into five piles by color with space left below each pile to form a column. Space for a discard pile goes off to the side. Each turn, the player begins with an empty hand and rolls the two dice. The numeral on the D6 determines how many cards the player must draw, and the color die determines what color pile the player must draw from. With these cards in hand, the player must now distribute them among the columns beneath the color piles, using a mancala-style distribution that wraps around and will cause newer cards to cascade down, partially covering previously-placed cards. Any three-card sets that are created within the columns are now removed along with the colored pyramid that sits above that column.&#10;&#10;Once a color pile is depeleted, subsequent die rolls of that color allow the player to remove a matching color card from one of the columns and reposition it at the bottom of any column desired, thus allowing for the possibility of sets being created through the joining of two previously unconnected groups of cards within a single column, along with the rare opportunity for two sets to be formed at once. Victory is achieved when a player has successfully defeated all 15 security measures (represented by the 15 pyramids). Defeat occurs when all the cards have been depleted while there are pyramids still standing.&#10;&#10;"
