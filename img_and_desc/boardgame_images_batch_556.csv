Armed with a Spellbook and with the aid of the enchanted Element-Stones, the sorcerers summoned fantastic Creatures and magical Spells. A wizard who had no more pages left in his Spellbook would eventually have lost the magical battle of wits.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent's card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he puts the top card of his or her deck on his Discard Pile (or Archive). If a player is unable to draw a card, he loses immediately.&#10;&#10;Elemental Clash: The Master Set is the ultimate deal well-suited for beginners, while still interesting for the veterans. It contains 80 different cards, over 270 in total, carefully selected by the designer from all previous sets of Elemental Clash. The &quot;Master Set&quot; also features updated, state-of-the-art illustrations done by an international cast of talented artists.&#10;&#10;"

Players take the part of battalion and company commanders, the highest level of command which could exert a significant influence on the course of the battle once it had begun. After becoming familiar with the rules, players should be able to recreate actions in some of the great battles of the war such as the Marne, Ypres, Gallipoli, Verdun, the Somme, Passchendale, the Argonnes Forest or the Kaiserschlagt.

Players divide into two teams. One team selects the category and presses the start button. An audible timer beeps a count-down while the person holding the device tries to get their team to say the word or phrase on the screen. If they are successful, they hand the device to the next person on the opposite team. The goal of the round is to not be holding the device when the timer goes off -- though those last furtive seconds can get dicey! When the timer goes off, the opposing team gets a point and (based on what version of the game you are playing) may also have a chance to steal the phrase for an extra point. The first team to reach seven points wins!&#10;&#10;The primary differences of this game from its progenitor is the implementation of the electronic device, timer, and substantial word lists. The electronic edition has also spawned several spin-offs and sequels. As of 2013, &quot;Electronic&quot; was dropped from the name, leaving it as simply Catch Phrase, effectively replacing the original.&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Catch Phrase!&#10;&#10;&#10;"

A shibumi object may appear simple but will reward the viewer with hidden depths as it is explored over time. Shibumi is simplicity hiding complexity.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&#10;The Shibumi set is not a single game but many games; it is the simplest of game systems. The set includes a square board with 4x4 holes and 48 white, black and red balls (16 each).&#10;&#10;Balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls. Conversely, if a ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. If a ball is not pinned then it&rsquo;s free.&#10;&#10;EDITIONS&#10;&#10;Published by nestorgames, it is presented in 3 editions:&#10;&#10;- Ninja: Small, light, portable. It includes a black and small cotton bag, a blue foam board, 19mm plastic balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games.&#10;&#10;- Samurai: Big, solid, strong. It includes a big white bag, a laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic board and 25mm phenolic resin balls (same material as snooker balls) in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a sheet with rules for 7 games. Optionaly 3 bowls for the marbles can be purchased.&#10;&#10;- Shogun: The executive edition for the big boss. It includes a big laser-cut 8mm thick 'ice' acrylic box with 4x4 holes on its lid, a big white bag, 25mm phenolic resin balls in 3 colours (16 each of white, black and red), and a pendrive with rules for many games. You will be able download future games and computer versions into your pendrive as they become available.&#10;&#10;The phenolic balls are absolutely exquisite as they are:&#10;&#10;- Light: around 15 grams each.&#10;- Round: each ball is perfectly spherical without blemish; they stack and drop correctly every time.&#10;- Warm: both in temperature and in the nice snooker ball &quot;clack&quot; they make when struck together.&#10;- Tough: they won't chip or crack and seem pretty much indestructible.&#10;&#10;They look and feel fantastic. When you pick them up you just want to keep fondling them.&#10;&#10;HISTORY&#10;&#10;Games and puzzles based on square pyramidal stackings have existed at least since Edouard Lucas' cannon-ball stacking problem of 1875. The most famous 4x4 square pyramidal game is Pylos (published by Gigamic). Shibumi is different due to the third ball colour, drop mechanism, different numbers of players, lack of a board gutter, and the fact that it's a system for playing many games rather than the embodiment of a single game. Some Shibumi games may be playable with a Pylos set but many will not.&#10;&#10;Shibumi game system concept by Cameron Browne 2011.&#10;&#10;GAMES&#10;&#10;This is the official geeklist of Shibumi games:&#10;&#10;Official Shibumi games list&#10;&#10;Please feel free to create your own game for this system!&#10;&#10;The names of these games all start with &lsquo;SP&rsquo; because they're Square Pyramidal games:&#10;&#10;"

Over the course of five rounds, you'll decide when to keep searching for more treasure and when to snatch any loot you can and run away.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with one gold as booty. Each round lasts multiple turns, and at the start of each turn the active player draws a coin from the bag to determine how the current pile of loot would be split should players make a grab for it, e.g., if this fortune coin is gold, a player can take the loot if he's the only one to grab for it. Players then use a coin in their stash to secretly decide whether to grab for loot or stay the course and hope for more treasure in later rounds. After players (potentially) plunder the loot, the active player flips the fortune coin, adding it to the loot if the skull side lands up or placing it aside in the monster pile if the monster appears; when three monsters of the same type have shown up, the round ends and all remaining loot returns to the bag.&#10;&#10;If a player holds booty worth 25 or more during the game, he wins immediately.

Of the 60 spaces, 40 are labeled &quot;3&quot; and the remaining 20 are labeled &quot;6&quot;, values which only apply during Phase 2.  Each player or team has 30 pyramid pieces available to play.  Play consists of two phases with an option of playing only one phase for children.&#10;&#10;In Phase 1, players alternate turns and attempt to make as many triads as possible, scoring three points for each turn in which one or more Triads are made.  A placement which results in multiple Triads being formed still only scores three points.  Triads consist of three playing pieces in a row in any direction - diagonally or orthogonally, including a stack.  Playing pieces may not be stacked more than three high.  Score is kept in real time via a scoring track and moving plastic marker along the edge of the board.&#10;&#10;In Phase 2, Triads are removed.  If the removal of a Triad reveals numbers on the board, those numbers - three or six - are added to the player's score.  If a Triad stack is removed, the single revealed number is doubled.  If a player has a Triad available to him to remove, he must remove it, even though it's to his strategic disadvantage.  If he cannot remove one, the other player or team plays until he has an available move or both players have no Triads that can be removed.  Keeping track of number placement when laying Triads is strategically wise.&#10;&#10;"

Each round involves one set of partners bidding on a trump suit, cards are played around the table as the bidding team tries to win the required number of tricks. Between rounds, a battle map is updated with results. The goal is for one team to capture the center hex on the map. Depending on board position and hand results, partners may earn 'reinforcement' draws in future rounds to make their hands stronger.&#10;&#10;Partners may discuss board position between rounds, but within a round they must anticipate other player actions. Some example decisions: &quot;My partner has this trick so far - should I play trump or save it for later?&quot; and &quot;My opponent called trump - should I draw some of it out?&quot;&#10;&#10;Differences between Dwarven and traditional Euchre include fantasy-themed cards, the battle map, sorcerer wildcards, and reinforcement draws. The rules contain example play and a two-player version.&#10;&#10;"
