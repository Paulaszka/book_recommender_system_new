If the pitcher catches the ball, it's an out; if not, the batter gets a single, double, triple, or home run, depending on where the ball left the stadium.&#10;&#10;"

From Madonna and mullets to moonwalks and Monday Night Football, this party game isn't about what you know, but how you show it.&#10;&#10;Here's how it works: Each turn, the opposing team draws a clue card and assigns points to each of the five activity choices, according to how hard they think each one will be. If they pull the &quot;Red Bull&quot; card, they may think drawing it is easy, so they'd give it one point. But acting? Hard. Five points! Now it's up to you to decide: Will you go for the easy points and draw, or go for the big points (and glory) by acting it out?&#10;&#10;Each turn you get to choose to act, draw, hum, sculpt, or use letter cubes to get your team to guess the clue.

It is low-tide and the waterline will recede (= a tile is turned over) whenever a moon symbol is rolled. New oysters are put on the new beach tile. After all tiles have become beach, it is high-tide: each moon symbol rolled means that a tile has to be turned over again. When all tiles have become water, the game is over.&#10;A player rolling an oyster may look under an oyster: if it is empty, he puts it back, if there's a pearl, he takes the counter. If he rolls the arrow symbol, he also looks for an oyster but puts an additional oyster on one of the beach tiles. The player with the most pearls gets a pearl card. The player who first has three pearl cards after consecutive plays, receives the crown card and may call himself the pearl king.&#10;&#10;"
