14716,,"The Universal Combat System is an expandable miniatures battle system. The UCS is a system of combat rules meant for any number of players in an infinite amount of settings. The players determine what kind of universe their games will be set in, whether it's classic fantasy, sci-fi, or even modern warfare. The UCS provides the basic template for the game, and the players work out the details of what types of units will be involved in the campaigns. Players can then adjust certain rules to fit the setting and units they have chosen for their games.&#10;&#10;"

It is also possible for the players' characters to start doing drugs themselves, which in the game mostly has positive effects (doing speed allows you to roll two dice for movement instead of one, for example). Not surprisingly, the game has received a lot of criticism for glorifying drug abuse. So... avoid the police, getting shot, getting AIDS and becoming a heroin-addict and you might just make it to India!&#10;&#10;"

It then wends its way, 2D6 at a time, through obstacles such as committee hearings and filibusters, and when it succeeds in passing one chamber, it starts over in the other. After approval of both Senate and House, it makes its way 1D6 at a time toward final signing.&#10;&#10;Players get one Parliamentary Procedure Card at game start, and may pick up Congressional Record cards along the way. Some of these have instructions (go forward or back x spaces), but others are &quot;negotiable&quot;.

The number of cards, from 1 to 3, each player selects, and when they are revealed, depends on the speed of his/her dragster, which generally increases from the start line. As dragsters collide with each other, they are knocked off course, and may rebound from the &quot;walls&quot; of the track. Each dragster has a supply of mines and missiles, as well as a certain amount of power for shields to deflect hits.

The other players all play highway patrol men trying to catch the bandit in action as he sets out to commit robberies and get back to his hideout. The patrol men are also given cards to randomly determine their starting locations on the board. The game includes a board with 3 spinners on it, the bandit always uses spinner #1 which gives the most possible movement. The spinner used by the patrol men is dependent upon how many players are in the game. The more players the slower the spinner.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game for the bandit is to make 3 robberies, returning to his hideout between each of them. The bandit must announce which type of crime he is committing giving the patrol men an idea where he may be. The patrol men have to end their movement on the bandit's location. The patrol men have special items they can use in their search for the bandit such as road blocks and the use of a helicopter.&#10;&#10;"

Players decide before the game starts whether they will read through all four before replacing each card or not.  Each question has multiple choice answers and is worth a number of points specified on the card.  Each correct answer allows the player or team's token to be moved that many spaces.  24 seconds is recommended as the time limit for answering.  Some spaces on the board have special instructions that must be followed (lose a turn, move ahead two, that sort of thing.)  Variant games are also suggested in the rules, such as rolling the die (provided with the game) to determine movement instead of taking the point value from the card.&#10;&#10;"

There are 34 tiles, each containing four squares and either red or yellow colored walls.

Unlike Double Morphus, the maze is not three dimensional.&#10;&#10;Each player has 3 guards and a trover.  The object of the game is to collect all energy points of a player's given color, or to capture the opponent's trover.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player may move all of his pieces 10 squares each.  Guards may move orthogonally only, and trovers may move both orthogonally and diagonally.  Only trovers may collect energy points.  Guards serve to block movement.&#10;&#10;Energy points may be spent to &quot;morph&quot; a maze tile by sliding it into an adjacent empty square.  Each point spent allows two such morphs.  Tiles containing a trover may not be morphed.&#10;&#10;To capture an opposing trover, it must be immobilized by a combination of enemy guards, walls, empty space, or enemy energy points for one full turn.  A trover can force itself past an enemy guard by surrendering either an energy point or the life of a friendly guard.&#10;&#10;"

The black has large numbers, while the red has a much smaller fleet of faster ships.  Speed is very important, since faster ships can retreat from combat from slower ones unless attackers move in from all six adjacent hexes. The red force also has battlecruisers, which have the speed of a cruiser and nearly the combat strength of a battleship. There is a blue fleet for a third player, identical to the red fleet.&#10;&#10;In addition to spaceships, there are several types of ground forces with which to contend for control of systems.&#10;&#10;The map has star systems scattered across it, and many nebulae, which slow movement.&#10;&#10;"

Three special six-sided dice are used; each dice has three red letters (an &quot;L,&quot; a &quot;C,&quot; and an &quot;R&quot;) along with three black dots.  Players start with three chips.  Each rolls the dice (never any more dice than chips) and distributes chips according to the roll, either to the player on the left, the center (pot), the player on the right, or no action if a black dot is rolled.  Play continues clockwise.  Players without chips can stay in the game because the rolls of others may give them some chips (hence the name of the game), but must pass on their roll.&#10;&#10;Never Say Die, published in 1959, was republished almost exactly in 1992 as LCR.  There are two rules in Never Say Die that are missing in LCR.  First, players may permanently &quot;retire&quot; any number of chips over three that they own as individual winnings.  Second, the winner of the pot in Never Say Die is the player who holds the last chip not in the pot and who rolls a &quot;C.&quot;  It's possible that a player will hold the last two or even the last three chips not in the pot; in this case she may be fortunate enough to roll nothing but &quot;C's&quot; and work all her chips to the center to win.  If the player holding the last chip rolls a dot, she keeps rolling until she gets a letter.  The winner starts the next game.&#10;&#10;This boxed game included a plastic dice cup (with snap-on lid), three dice, 24 large chips, and instructions.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    LCR&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each player controls five Arthurs and a host of other Arthurian characters in a heated attempt to grab and retrieve the sword before any other player succeeds in this task.&#10;&#10;On the surface, the game appears to be a very simple wargame, combat being quickly resolved without any dice as characters fight each other. The key to the game, however, is that two players are always taking turns at the same time, the turns being regulated by &quot;turn tokens&quot; that pass around the board. When one player finishes his or her turn, the turn-token is passed to the next player who does not already have one. If one player is a slowpoke taking his turn, then the other turn-token passes around the table, allowing other players to take turns. This forces players to take very fast turns, usually about 5 seconds each, allowing the game to move along with the intensity of a video game. Games usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, even with three to six players.&#10;&#10;Special rules resolve potential conflicts that could occur when two players try to perform actions simultaneously where priority is in question, resolving quickly and simply.&#10;&#10;No player ever quite gets knocked out of the game due to loss of characters; Arthurs always &quot;rejuvenate&quot;, returning to your pile of pieces (your &quot;village&quot;) that can enter the board. Characters start at a chosen entry space at the edge of the board, and move to the center to grab Excalibur, returning the Sword to their entry space to win. Each of the 5 character-types (Merlin, Lancelot, etc) have their own unique abilities, but everyone starts with an identical set of pieces.&#10;&#10;There are also two variants in the rules, allowing players to vary the game by going after the &quot;Accoutrements of Kingship&quot; instead of the Sword, or by gathering a number of gold pieces scattered around the board so as to &quot;buy the kingship&quot;. Tokens are included for these variants.&#10;&#10;The game is very intense and fast, requiring players to think on their feet and make fast realtime decisions; if you are a big fan of slow, deep thinking, strategy games, you might look elsewhere.&#10;&#10;"

Soviet units have been treated in a unique way, in that the second step strength of a two step unit varies and is unknown to all players until the unit is reduced. For example: a 3 strength infantry unit's second step may reveal itself to be: two, one or * (annihilation!). Soviet leaders are treated in a similar way, with ratings of: 3 (Zhukov only), 2, 1, 0 and *, being revealed to all players only at the moment of battle. Leaders have combat strength and command control ability equal to their rating, and they keep units in supply up to the number of hexes equal to their rating. A leader with a rating of 1 exerts command control into adjacent hexes, a leader with 0 has no combat strength but gives supply to units in the same hex and a * leader is removed before combat, thereby having no effect. Only German panzer corps have a second turn phase, allowing them to exploit breakthroughs. The turn sequence changes in Winter for the Soviet counter attack.&#10;&#10;"
