Each player chooses two cards, then passes the remaining cards to the left. All players reveal their cards at the same time, then decide whether to use 0, 1, or 2 of them in personal rows of cards. When you start a row, you can use any card; to add a card to an existing row, that card must be higher than the row's highest card or lower than the lowest one. A player can have at most three rows of cards. Discard any cards you don't use.&#10;&#10;Players repeat this drafting, passing, and playing process until they have played ten cards. The first round ends, and players now receive 3 points for each blue card in their rows.&#10;&#10;Players then receive a new hand of ten cards to start round 2, once again choosing two cards and passing the rest, but now to the right. Players continue building on the rows that they already have, scoring 3 points for each blue card and 4 points for each green card at the end of round two.&#10;&#10;For round three, players have ten more cards and pass cards to the left once again. At the end of this round, players once again score for their blue and green cards, while also receiving 7 points for each gray card in their rows. Additionally, each player scores for their pink cherry blossom cards, with these cards having a pyramidal scoring structure: one card = 1 point, two cards = 3, three cards = 6, etc. Whoever has the highest total score wins!&#10;&#10;"

You do this by keeping fairies in your alliance that gain you favor points. Each card represents a single fairy from one of the five families. Each family has a unique power that enables you to improve your alliance and thwart opponents. Each round, you choose a single fairy, playing it into your alliance tableau, then resolve the family power. Easy, except that with all those powers, fairies don't seem to stay in one alliance for long. They tend to be...fickle.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to set up before the game, players decide which five fairy suits to use in the game from the 22 suits included in the box. In each round, you are dealt three cards; you look at them, decide on the order in which to stack them, then pass that stack to another player. You'll receive a stack in turn, which is in effect a &quot;press your luck&quot; deck created by an opponent. You look at the top card, then decide whether to keep it or discard it and draw the next card, which you can also discard in favor of the third card. Once the &quot;press your luck&quot; draw is complete, each player has one fairy card in hand, which they play into their alliance, then resolve in order starting with whoever played the card with the highest favor.&#10;&#10;After the fifth round, players score each fairy suit in their alliances, and because fairies want equal influence in an alliance, scores are based on an inverse scoring curve:&#10;&#10;&#10;     1 card of a suit: Score its favor value.&#10;     2 cards: Score 0 points.&#10;     3-4 cards: Lose points equal to the card of this suit with the highest favor.&#10;     5 or more cards of a suit: Score the summed value of all these cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;The player with the highest favor score wins.&#10;&#10;"

Each one builds on previous discoveries, called prerequisites, and paves the way for new discoveries.&#10;&#10;During a game, you will build together the &quot;Discovery Tree&quot; by each placing cards in turns. Discovery allows you, with a same deck of cards, to play several different types of games (from beginner level to expert). Depending on the type of game, the goal can be either to be the first to empty your hand (games with no points), or to collect the maxim number of points (you earn points each time you place a card).&#10;&#10;In all games, each player starts with 5 cards. During your turn, you can place a card in the Discovery Tree if all its prerequisites have already been placed, or if it has no prerequisite (the starting cards). Once placed, a card benefits all players who can then use it as a prerequisite to place their own cards. The game ends as soon as the stack is empty and a player empties his hand.&#10;&#10;Discovery is thus a semi-collaborative game which, like the evolutionary process, combines both collaboration and competition.&#10;&#10;The Antiquity deck can be played as a stand alone game, or as an extension of the Prehistory deck (2019 edition).&#10;&#10;Discovery is a game for adults and kids, from 6 years old, and ideal to play with the whole family. It can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players. Game plays range from intense and fast 15 minutes, to long strategic game (~60 minutes), depending on the type of game and the number of players.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Grow too quickly and you won't be able to sustain your empire, grow too slowly and other players will surely beat you to the finish.&#10;&#10;With no guidelines restricting player interaction, each of the players is highly encouraged to interact with one another through diplomatic talks. Alliances, war, declaration of friendships, trade, treaties, shunning, the list goes on. Players must bear in mind however the repercussions of their choices and how they may affect other players.
