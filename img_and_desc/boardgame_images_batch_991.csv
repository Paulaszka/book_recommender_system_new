During the Draft, players will take turns drawing and drafting basketball players to form their basketball team. Each basketball player has a skill level (1-6) for each of the shot attempt skills. The higher the skill number, the higher the chance of that player scoring on their shot attempt.&#10;&#10;Once their teams are established, players will begin play. Players will shuffle their player decks and draw the top 5 basketball player cards to form their lineup. They then will choose one player from their lineup to put into the scoring position.&#10;&#10;Next, one player will reveal the Shot Attempt Card and reveal what shot the players will attempt. Both players will roll their basketball die and compare the number rolled with their basketball player's skill number of the shot that is being attempted. If the player's skill number is equal to or exceeds the number the player rolled on his/her die, then the scoring attempt is successful. The player gains the number of points the shot attempt awards (1,2, or 3 points). Players then move their scoring marker on their player scoreboard.&#10;&#10;Players will repeat this process until the Shot Attempt Deck is depleted. This completes a quarter. The game consists of 4 quarters. After all 4 quarters, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

All morning long, the men in gray have pressured the Union cavalry. Help finally arrives in the form of I Corps commander Major Gen. John Reynolds. He rides up to the Lutheran Seminary, where Buford is directing the battle from its cupola. Reynolds calls to Buford, &quot;What goes, John?&quot; The cavalryman simply points to the long lines of advancing Confederates and says, &quot;The Devil's to pay!&quot; Reynolds then asks, &quot;Can you hold?&quot;, to which Buford responds, &quot;I reckon I can.&quot; Reynolds ends the exchange with, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ride out and see all about it.&quot; And with that rather brief, mundane conversation began one of the most important and iconic military engagements in history &ndash; the Battle of Gettysburg.&#10;&#10;A Most Fearful Sacrifice is an epic two-player wargame with over 15 square feet of playing area and 526 playing pieces depicting the fighting that occurred during all three days of this decisive clash. The game utilizes a new ACW operating system called the Black Swan system, which is closely related to the popular Blind Swords game system first introduced in the game The Devil&rsquo;s To Pay! by Tiny Battle Publishing. This version of the system is specifically designed to handle larger-scale battles yet keep rules overhead low. Players can simulate huge encounters in a reasonable amount of playing time. This is accomplished in one way through the use of card draws rather than chit pulls. Also, players will trigger activations by Corps instead of by lower-level formations but they still have tactical decision-making choices by needing to determine which Divisions get activation priority. Though at a grander scale, this system maintains a tactical feel about it and still emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of war &hellip; the Fortunes of War, the Friction of War and the Fog of War. Players will be challenged to deal with a constantly developing battle situation, never quite sure of what the Gods of War will throw at them, and thus they must always be prepared to deal with historically realistic &ldquo;black swan&rdquo; events.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;Unit Counter illustration provided by First Legion Ltd.&#10;&#10;"

It is based on the classic mechanics of wargames, which implies the presence of a playing field, divided into hexagons (with different types of terrain), game pieces reflecting combat units and the use of the so-called &quot;Battle Table&quot;. Combat pieces-tokens move around the game map, spending their &quot;movement points&quot; - the more &quot;movement points&quot;, the higher the speed of the unit. The main characteristic of the unit is its &quot;combat strength&quot;. When troops enter a battle, then, depending on the &quot;combat strength&quot; of the units participating in it, a column is selected in the &quot;Battle Table&quot;, on which players roll a die, which is used as a random number generator. The more the player has gathered strength in battle, the higher his chances of success.&#10;&#10;In Battle players will control &quot;armies&quot; roughly corresponding to the troops of France, Russia, Germany and Great Britain in the second half of the 19th century - the opponents will have approximately more or less the same number of chips, However, each army has its own small characteristic national &quot;flavor&quot;. Having become familiar with the game principles, the player can almost easily join the world of the historical tabletop wargame by turning to more complex game developments. In them, already dedicated to specific historical operations, it will be possible to lead &quot;real&quot; armies on historically accurate maps and try to achieve specific military goals that faced the real commanders of that era.&#10;&#10;We are confident that as a result, our game will be interesting to everyone.

It's an asymmetric tactical RPG for 3 to 6 players, with a modular board. Players have limited actions to prepare &amp; cast spells, manage their hand &amp; resources, and survive the maze.&#10;&#10;LORE - SETTING:&#10;Players are power-hungry sorcerers in search of a long lost divine scroll of power. They will need to foil their opponents and the dangers of the maze to find the key, retrieve the artefact and race back to the exit; knowing that anyone left behind could be waiting on their way back.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;Players will attempt to retrieve the Scroll at the end of the dungeon and make their way back out with it. However, they must first find the Relic (key) among the hidden items randomized on the Treasure tiles.&#10;&#10;SETUP:&#10;Players start by choosing their game mode: Battle Royale or Team battle (or Cooperative, coming in an expansion). The game is played in 4 phases of 3 turns each, for a maximum of 12 turns.&#10;&#10;At first, players set the tiles to create the board, using a recommended or custom layout. Treasure tiles (items to collect) and Wall tiles (restricting movement/targeting) are safe to walk on, but most tiles bare Runes that will damage the players health &amp; mana.&#10;&#10;They then select their characters, using the starting deck provided or customizing their strategy (for experienced players). Each begins with the same number: a free spell, 7 spells in-hand, 1 trap card in hand, and 1 trap card in their personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;Players then order their 4 Divination cards, each offering them cumulative bonuses during one of the game's 4 phases. And once the turn-order is decided (by drawing numbered tokens), the first player can enter the maze. The game begins.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Players aim to find the Relic among the hidden items, going to each Treasure tile and getting stronger in the process. With the Relic in their possession (secretly or not), they can take the Scroll from the shrine. But any item can be stolen from other players, so escaping with it will be challenging.&#10;&#10;Players have 4 actions available per turn (moving up to 2-3 tiles, preparing a spell, casting any number of prepared spells, using an item, healing health or mana, etc.)&#10;&#10;Mostly, players use their actions to prepare spells in advance (one action by level, up to 3); or to cast one or more spells they had prepared, so players will always need to anticipate their future needs. Spells are used to attack, move yourself or others, heal, or disable opponents. Only a disabled opponent can be looted.&#10;&#10;Trap cards (Tenacity cards) can be used for free in reaction to a spell targeting them. Once used, it is removed from the game. Each player has two Tenacity cards (one in hand and one in the discard pile at the start of the game).&#10;&#10;Except for your free spell, all used spells are then discarded. However, a tenacity track goes up with every health or mana lost or spent, allowing you to retrieve cards in your personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;If a player falls to 0 HP with mana remaining, it's not over just yet. Next turn, they'll be disabled and will need to exchange their mana for health. But more rarely, if a player falls to 0 HP &amp; Mana, they'll die for good; winning is now out of reach, but as a vengeful spirit with limited actions, the player still has a role to play (either haunting its murderer or helping its team).&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player gets back to the starting portal with the Scroll in hand. So, select your character, build your strategy around their unique playstyle, and rush to the scroll or wait to steal it. In the end, only one Maegan will get the Scroll.&#10;&#10;"

You as the base commander must operate the protection system and take control of the missiles and two Plasma cannons. Each Plasma cannon has a limited firing capacity, a max range and an overheating protection system. The Federation has explained that it looks as if there will be [5] waves consisting of groups of asteroids heading towards the Moon base with four waves of asteroids per group. Each asteroid will be represented by a d6 die. You must protect the moon base and keep each of the three bases from being destroyed.&#10;&#10;Victory conditions:&#10;Your goal is to protect the Moon base at all costs.  You must save at least 1 base with a shield value of at least one.  A total victory would be all bases saved with full shield values of six each.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

329315,,"A competitive Scrabble-esque word game for two players or teams. Players take turns being the &quot;forming&quot; and &quot;defending&quot; side over four rounds. Each round the forming player randomly draws letter tiles one at a time and places them on the grid starting from the center. Each new letter played must either form a complete word, or marked with one of ten pawns as an incomplete word. Each incomplete word must have a possible word declared for the unused letters. After every five letters played the defending player has a blocking tile available to prevent progress of the forming team. Each forming phase ends when the forming player either plays a complete word that uses a corner space, or gets three strikes. Strikes are accumulated for being unable to play a tile, declaring a word that would not fit in the area, or playing an illegal or false word. After each phase, players score points for each letter used in complete words only, and possibly double their score if they end on a corner that corresponds to the round being played.&#10;&#10;"
