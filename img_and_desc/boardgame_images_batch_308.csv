Here, the battlefield is an extension of the political arena. Many historical movers and shakers support or oppose their presidents&rsquo; war plans. Will Mr. Lincoln save the Union? Will Mr. Davis succeed in sundering one nation and creating another? How will you direct their political support?&#10;&#10;Lincoln&rsquo;s War is a card-driven game using cards to activate generals, but in Lincoln&rsquo;s War, activation numbers are also political currency or PC. PC not only activates generals but promotes worthy commanders, purchases war material, forces indecisive commanders to act, and represents support for the war. A decisive PC point spread is an advantage in winning the game but driving an opponent to 0 PC (and 0 Congressional support) at the end of a turn will ensure victory, even in the face of defeat.&#10;&#10;Unique features include a diceless combat system, seditious characters, and immobilization tokens. The combat system requires players to husband resources and congressional political support to ensure victory. Seditious characters oppose their respective Presidents&rsquo; handling of the war and sooner or later will erode a president&rsquo;s vital political support. Immobilization tokens reflect damage in the form of casualties, as well as hesitation, confusion and even insubordination.&#10;&#10;Lincoln&rsquo;s War contains:&#10;    1 22&quot; x 34&quot; map&#10;    1 color rulebook&#10;    1 color play and background booklet&#10;    162 Operations Cards&#10;    2 countersheets&#10;    2 player aid cards&#10;&#10;Lincoln&rsquo;s War was designed by John Poniske with the assistance of Mike Joslyn, and features the artwork of Niko Eskubi and map artwork by Mark Mahaffey.&#10;&#10;(source: MMP website)&#10;&#10;"

This is a two-player operational level game depicting the battles in the Crimean peninsula of the Soviet Union during 1941 and 1942. Beginning in mid-October 1941 and ending in January 1942, it completes the year 1941 in this series of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. And it includes 1942 scenarios of the continued fighting in Crimea until the historical fall of the great Soviet naval fortress Sevastopol in July 1942.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS&#10;&bull; One 22x34 inch map (map Q)&#10;&bull; Four 11 x 17 Scenario Cards&#10;&bull; Two double-sided Soviet Set Up Cards&#10;&bull; Two Axis Set Up Cards (one double-sided)&#10;&bull; One 11x17 inch folded Chart Card with Combat Results Table, Terrain Effects Chart, movement charts, artillery and Non-Op HQ charts&#10;&bull; One 11x17 inch folded Chart Card with &ldquo;How to Read Units&rdquo; information, air combat, AA fire, interdiction effects, overrun and combat related charts&#10;&bull; One 8.5 x 11 chart card with Super-Heavy Artillery Inset Effects Table.&#10;&bull; Two Air Unit Status/Unit Rebuilding Cards (one Soviet [beige] and one Axis [gray]).&#10;&bull; Two Cards containing Scenario 3,4 and 5 Victory Conditions&#10;&bull; One 8.5 x 11 card with naval charts and tables&#10;&bull; One 8.5 x 11 Card with Turn Record track and Weather Table&#10;&bull; 740 die-cut &frac12; inch counters in two full counter sheets and two half counter sheets&#10;&bull; One ten-sided die&#10;&#10;THE GAME&#10;&#10;This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, waffen SS, NKVD, militia, base units, naval units, and more. You have reinforcement options to tailor your army to fight a full campaign with many historical variables.&#10;&#10;As we have indicated with each game, all games in this series share the same game mechanics. Veteran East Front Series (EFS) players will find much here that is familiar. Such mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away, and for them we have clarified many game procedures. For those who are new to the series, examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.&#10;&#10;All games of the EFS series are built to fit together side-by-side for possible combined play. We recognize that space is at a premium for some of you, so consider that all of the eight scenarios in this game require only one map or less; yes, just one map! Newcomers should try this game as a sample of the whole series.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Crimea includes several special features not found with all EFS games. Since the game revolves around Sevastopol, we include a special inset map to depict in detail the fighting at that important naval fortress. Much gaming will directly involve the inset, so we have streamlined previous series rules dealing with an inset map. We have also streamlined the naval rules, effectively rebuilding them. This in turn allowed us to rebuild the Odessa scenario found with the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series. There, and later in Crimea, the Soviets used amphibious operations to move battle lines forward. If an amphibious operation is not going well, the Soviets could declare an Evacuation. At Sevastopol the German player will be using his super-heavy artillery, including the world&rsquo;s largest artillery piece, Dora, historically seen in the final game scenario. The design notes include an essay on these wonder-weapons.&#10;&#10;Barbarossa: Crimea challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?&#10;&#10;THE SCENARIOS&#10;&#10;1) Learning Scenario: The Tartar Ditch. The German 11th Army has just received orders to enter the Crimea but to do so it must first clear the narrow Perekop Isthmus. This was the first battle for the Crimea. This is a small scenario but it teaches important lessons in precise game unit positioning - exactly what one would expect for historical positional warfare.&#10;&#10;2) Odessa: Hero City. This is a bloody example of siege warfare. The Romanian army shows exactly why it was so ill-suited for such an offensive, while the Soviets struggle to balance their forces from sector-to-sector and endure delays of reinforcements coming by sea. This rebuilds the scenario found in theArmy Group South game using new research and this game&rsquo;s improved naval rules.&#10;&#10;3) Crimea: The Road to Sevastopol. This begins in mid October 1941. The Germans almost certainly will break through the main Soviet defense line, so the Soviet player has to know when to break away from the action and run back to fresh prepared positions, a tactic typical of game play in other series games. The German player also chooses secret victory conditions. He will either drive south to Sevastopol or southeast to Kerch, forcing the Soviet to balance his defense of both.&#10;&#10;4) Sevastopol: The First Battle. With the Germans committed to Sevastopol, can the Soviet divert enough German attention elsewhere to save the fortress? In the meantime, the deeper the German pushes into the Sevastopol inset map, the better his chances for long-term victory.&#10;&#10;5) Crimean Campaign. The campaign scenario puts scenarios 3 and 4 together to feature a punch and counter-punch game strategy. The Soviet player relies on his naval units to rapidly shift the threat. The German relies on his infantry to consolidate gains.&#10;&#10;6) Kerch: The Party Boss Attack. Ever wonder why Mandated Attacks exist in this game system? In the middle of winter 1942 one of Stalin&rsquo;s cronies thought the armies holding the Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea were not sufficiently motivated to defeat the fascists. He personally bullied the local Front commander into do-or-die attacks. This scenario exemplifies the insanity of political expectations trumping battlefield realities. Can you find a weakness in the Axis line?&#10;&#10;7) Kerch: Operation Trappenjagd. Now it is the German turn to attack in the Kerch Peninsula but their champion knows how to attack. This is a brilliantly planned German attack, one that pays handsome dividends. Can you repeat Manstein&rsquo;s success? As the Soviet can you defeat Manstein&rsquo;s attack?&#10;&#10;8) Sevastopol: Operation Storfang. This is the last picture show in the Crimea and it will be bloody. Truly, the best is saved for the last as the Soviets fight for every last hill, fort, and farmhouse. They went down fighting and their sacrifice earned them great honor in the history books. It was close. The German plan of offensive was sound and it met each challenge the Soviets posed. Can you duplicate Manstein&rsquo;s cold calculations and earn your marshal&rsquo;s baton?&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE     2 days per turn&#10;MAP SCALE     5 miles per hex; inset map 1.6+ miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE     Division/Regiment; Air unit 40-80 aircraft&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS     1-4&#10;&#10;(from GMT website, components list from Playbook)&#10;&#10;"

There are 6 colored monk pieces, a Williams piece, and an Anson piece, all set up in different locations at the start. All monks start with 10 suspicion points and 5 clue points. Players are each randomly assigned one monk color (keep secret!). Each player receives 3 cards (which show either a monk, a location, or Williams/Anson).&#10;&#10;There are 7 rounds (days), each with 24 hours. Each day starts by revealing a random event tile in effect for that day. Then, players take turns playing cards: monk card = move that monk to a different location; location card = move any piece to that location; Williams/Anson card = move either of those pieces to any other location. Cards also have a number (0-5): add as many hours to the clock, unless you spend previously collected chits to reduce the number (by 1 per chit spent) -- spent chits added to the line of chits next to the board. If you move past 2400 hours, the day ends. Draw a card at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;When a monk is moved to a location, if there is no piece of their color, increase their suspicion by the sum of (both) chits present. If there is, take that chit and reduce the monk's suspicion score by the number on that chit. If it was the last chit, add 2 chits from the line next to the board.&#10;&#10;If Williams moves to a location, add/subtract 3 from each of the clue scores for all monks present there. For Anson, it's +/- 5 suspicion points.&#10;&#10;When the day ends, that player takes the event tile (=2 clue points against their monk at end of game). Convert suspicion points to clue points by ranking most to least (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 clue points); ties &quot;generous&quot;. Reset suspicion points to 10 for all monks.&#10;&#10;After days 1, 3, and 5 players reveal one color they are NOT.&#10;&#10;Day 7 is different: players simultaneously guess which monk other players were assigned. For every correct guess, that player's monk receives (substantial) additional clue points (number of points varies based on number of players).&#10;&#10;The player with the fewest clue points against their monk wins the game!&#10;&#10;"

Threats include cats and dogs, rats, stoats and weasels, long line fishing, plastic waste, developers, infertility and virus. Protection measures are laid down on families on the table and they protect against some of the threats. Conservation actions allow a variety of different actions such as exchanging cards with other players, picking up an additional cards and neutralizing threats.&#10;&#10;Each round finishes when one player goes out by playing all the cards in their hand onto the table. Points are scored for going out, for each bird in the families on the table and for having protection measures in place on those families.
