Each player starts with five cards in hand, and on a turn a player either (a) draws two cards or (b) draws one card and plays one card. In addition to the Wild Crow card, which can do just about anything, cards come in five letters, each with a special power that takes place when you play that card:&#10;&#10;&#10;    M &ndash; Misplace: Take one card from a player's murder &ndash; that is, his collection of cards on the table &ndash; and add it to your hand.&#10;    U &ndash; Uncover: All players reveal their hands and you take any one card and add it to your hand.&#10;    R &ndash; Reap: Draw one additional card.&#10;    D &ndash; Drain: Choose one letter.

Life was simple and peaceful in the village until a series of brutal murders.  The horrific nature of the killings left no question that werewolves had infiltrated the village. The villagers had little time to determine who the beasts were.  The werewolves were cunning, and used the paranoia to help the village tear itself apart.  Which side prevailed?&#10;&#10;Black Forest is a cooperative board game for 3 to 5 players.  Players win or lose together as members of the village.  However, one player is secretly a werewolf, trying to defeat the other players.  In order to win, the villagers must ascertain which player is the werewolf, and eliminate all of his or her villager tokens in the Court House.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into two phases.  In the Day Phase, players take turns placing their Villager tokens on village spaces (like the Fields, where they earn gold; the Market, where they can buy market cards; the Seer, where they can hire the Seer to have a vision on another player, and possibly gain clues about the player's role; or the Court House, where players vote to eliminate a Villager token belonging to one of the players).&#10;&#10;In the Night Phase, players are dealt a hand of Night cards, and must choose one and pass the rest, until they have a card chosen for each player in the game.  Cards are then assigned and revealed.  The Night Phase is where the werewolf player tries to eliminate Villager tokens from the game, but also when the villagers try to fortify against werewolf attack.&#10;&#10;After every other Night Phase, there is a Harvest, where the players must have enough gold to make it through.  If enough Villager tokens have been eliminated that the Harvest cannot be successful, the werewolf player wins.  Villagers can also win by upgrading all 12 Village tiles, but this involves spending gold that may be necessary for the Harvest.&#10;&#10;"

It&rsquo;s an area based system covering the entire campaign from the initial landing by Anglo-Spanish forces (at the invitation of the rebel Toulonnais) through to their evacuation of the town as their ships came under threat from the batteries of the previously unknown Napoleon Bonaparte.&#10;&#10;Operation points are at the heart of the system and combined with an innovative combat, loss and movement system generate a vast number of decision points for the players. Chrome comes in the form of spies, gendarmes, multi-national forces (and associated cooperation issues), reconnaissance, variable reinforcements and much more. The game covers an area from Ollioules in the West to Sollies in the East and from Mount Farron in the North to Cap Cepet in the South.&#10;&#10;&#10;"
