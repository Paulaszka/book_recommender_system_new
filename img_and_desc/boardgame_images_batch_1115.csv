But at the end of the day, the first player to fifteen points can celebrate a well-earned victory.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;There are a variable number of rounds, with each player, during their individual turn, able to perform any two of the following actions:&#10;&#10;Bring a data block into play &#10;Move a data block along a route&#10;Carry out a cyber-attack&#10;&#10;The core of the game are the Location tokens.&#10;Each location token bears the name of a location on the board where there is an Internet Exchange. &#10;From time to time, players either leave these locations or have to reach them to deliver their data blocks and gain the points they need to win the game. &#10;Players need to find a container where they can put the tokens, shake them well, and then pick them out one by one as the game progresses.&#10;Data are represented by wooden cubes; they move along the routes on the playing board towards the locations that host Internet Exchanges.&#10;&#10;In addition, players can place a digger (only one) on any route after finishing their turn and before the turn passes to the next player.

The night before, on 9 July, American and British airborne troops had already dropped into enemy territory behind the planned beach landing zones to occupy important positions. This was to prevent or delay timely counterattacks by Italian and German troops on the day of the landing.

Similar to Uno, players must play their cards to the discard pile as quickly as possible. But the cards must be played in order: Pang&gt;Ping&gt;Pong&gt;pang and so on. Players play as quickly as they can in no turn order, but a player cannot play twice to pile; another player must play a card before they can play again. The first player to shed their hand wins the round, and winning three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;There are also special cards such as double cards like PangPing which counts as player two in a row, and Skip, which lets you skip a card in order: Pang&gt;Skip&gt;Pong.&#10;&#10;"
