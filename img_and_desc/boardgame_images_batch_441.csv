This game represents a small-scale battle between two brave armies of Myrmidons, both trying to eliminate the rival. All of them look alike, but not all are equal. They vary in speed, strength and defense, and players must discover each other's weaknesses during the battle in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;The base game contains 12 myrmidon pieces (two each of six different types), a 6x7 checkered board, and a cotton case.

The action takes place into two different worlds: the celestial world, represented by a Taiji (Yin Yang); and the terrestrial world, represented by a map of Japan. The players represent kami and their mission is to give life to the earth. To achieve this, they will play counters, which represent vital energy (ki), in the two different worlds.&#10;&#10;Each player can play one counter par turn, but they have cards which represent shintai, that is to say temporary incarnations. With them, they can gather and spread more energy into the world. Furthermore, at the end of the game, the most powerful kami wins, that is to say, the player who gained the biggest number of shintai - or cards.&#10;&#10;By playing counters on the map of Japan, the players will spread the vital energy to the terrestrial world. Each city that is attained brings extra cards to the players and unlock new cards. The game actually finishes when the all the map of Japan is covered with counters. However, the players fail their mission if they finish the stack of cards before that point.&#10;&#10;By playing counters on the Yin Yang, the players enter the celestial world and challenge the dark powers, which may be helpful to restore the balance of power if counters are scarce. The Yin Yang is a secondary board inside the game box, which contains an ultraviolet lamp : when turned on, this lamp reveals the symbol of a moon on the counters, which was invisible before. The ki thus changes into kigetsu, &quot;moon energy&quot;, which allows to start a cosmic-scale battle.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

The maximum number of bombers a single Umpire can handle is about 10.&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;For a small rules set, this has some intriguing and innovative features.

These rules are intended to fill in the gap left by commercial sets, and enable you to fight actions in which each vessel is an 'individual.'

Managing your cards requires strategy, planning, resource consideration, sacrifice, and making the right card selection to replenish your hand.&#10;&#10;Players can choose to discard their cards to travel the game board and earn experience. They can use their cards to put together combination attacks against creatures in a quest to earn experience. The third option is to use cards to heal themselves when life gets too low. The game play is dynamic and competitive with other player disrupting plans and having plans of their own. You will need to manage your cards and maneuver your opponents to win the game.&#10;&#10;Goal: The goal of each player is the have the highest experience total at the end of the game. Experience is earned by using cards to either travel over the players color on the game board or by using them to damage a creature within a quest.&#10;&#10;Box: Wealth beyond belief is promised to the bravest and most acclaimed adventurer who can purge Dark Lion Pass of its frightful dwellers. However, everyone knows that the pass cannot be cleared by a lone adventurer.&#10;&#10;You join a group of adventurers that agree to work together to clear the menace from Dark Lion Pass and share the treasures and glory that come from accomplishing such a grand feat. The agreement is a loose alliance&hellip; each adventurer seems to be attempting to steal the glory and hoard the best treasures.&#10;Are they attempting to be the bravest adventurer and keep all of the reward for themselves?&#10;&#10;During the adventure you will try to gain as much glory as you can by stealing the treasure and doing the most damage to the creatures that lurk in the passes. You may also manipulate the path that your party takes to enhance your glory even further in Crossroads at Dark Lion Pass.&#10;&#10;Can you manage all of this with the limited resources at your disposal?

The basic idea is that there is a battle to control and capture a starship by a boarding party moving down the corridors and rooms of the ship. One side controls the attackers, who are mostly composed of the eponymous 'Starship Marines', and the defenders, usually less well armed crewmen, with perhaps a smattering of Marines to stiffen the defense. The deck plans can either be drawn out or built in 3D, depending on your preferences and time available. The scale of toy soldier is 25mm or 1/72, and any make of figures can be used [...]&#10;&#10;The minimum you need are a few toy soldiers, some dice, a large sheet of paper with a deck plan on it, and the rules. A typical small game takes about a hour or so (longer if you like arguing about rules). The largest game we know of, to date, involved some 60 people, hundreds of toy soldiers, and many very very big sheets of paper.[...]&#10;&#10;"

A player must be aware at all times of what his opponents are doing, what cards are in play, how many plants/prey are available and who will be first or last in the turns to come.  The gods are fickle and hunting is always uncertain at best, so to be smiled upon by the die of fate is a must.&#10;&#10;"

(A printable 2D version of the board is provided, with coordinate numbers in each square.) This printable gameboard is laid out as a 4x4 arrangement of 16 &quot;levels&quot;, each level being a 4x4 2D chessboard. Alternatively, 4 3D 4x4x4 gameboards set up in a row are usable. The game is available on Zillions, in a version by L Lynn Smith.&#10;&#10;Piece moves are translated as directly as possible from 2D to 4D, with some adaptations for play balance. So a rook now can move not only north-south and east-west, but up-down and side to side, too, for a maximum of 8 possible directions. Bishops move diagonally within each level, and may also move diagonally from level to level, which simplifies the move somewhat, changing the bishop from a fully 4D piece to one that is 2D+2D. This change makes the game much easier to play.&#10;&#10;The knight, on the other hand, rivals the queen in power, because it is the only piece in chess that already moves in 2 dimensions. On a 4x4x4x4 board, it can reach up to 2 dozen spots. The queen combines the moves of rook and bishop, and the king is a one-square queen in movement.&#10;&#10;Pawns are the most changed, moving 1 square &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;sideways&quot; - 6 locations in all, and capturing as it moves. This allows 2 pawns to support each other, a useful feature on &#10;a 4D board.&#10;&#10;The game is won by checkmate, which with the held king rule, can be achieved in the standard fashion, or it can be forced on a bare king by a king and 2 major pieces, from any legal positions on the board. The held king rule allows a king moving onto the other king's current &quot;level&quot; to pin the enemy king in that level. This solves a major problem in higher dimensional chess, that of mating the opponent on a 4D board, which has so many ways to escape.&#10;&#10;"

Are we playing ships captains or fleet admirals? In general naval wargamers tend to assume the role of admirals whilst demanding a level of detail more appropriate to a 'game of captains.' For most periods this isn't too much of a problem as the numbers of ships tends to be relatively small, and there are fleet level rules with appropriate levels of abstraction for most periods. However, ancient naval warfare seems to be one period where all available rules operate at the ship level. Obviously this makes battles such as Salamis, with hundreds of ships involved, difficult to handle. I wanted a set of rules that could be used to recreate these enormous battles whilst placing the placing the players truly in the roles of admirals and squadron commanders. At this level the fate of the individual ships, other than those on which the commanders themselves are embarked, is unimportant. Hence, &quot;Greek Fire and Roman Fury&quot; was born.&#10;&#10;&quot;The basis for these rules is a theory that the naval battles of antiquity were fought in a style that was essentially similar to typical land actions. Therefore, in these rules, the respective fleets are represented by squadrons rather than individual ships, which are maneuvered around the 'battlefield' in a similar manner to armies. After a few false starts I decided to use the ever popular and quite robust American Civil War Fire and Fury as the basis for the system, hence the name I finally selected for this article.&quot;&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;This miniatures rules set comes with information on what sorts of figures to use, and explains fleet composition, ship data (for the various sorts of ships that appear in the game), formations, sequence of play, morale, and a small number of charts&#10;&#10;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #187 (April 2003)&#10;&#10;"

The actions on the board are guided by talking radio, and the Fairy Godmother helps the players.&#10;&#10;Nine children of different colors are randomly distributed in the nine houses and they should find their way to their real home - if they knew where they belong! The mystery must be solved in order to make everything work again. Bronco the dog, Rocky the parrot, Schorsch the turtle and Susi the cat must work together. If you get hold of the right key, then you can help the yellow kid regain his memories and get home, after which you'll hear from the radio an enthusiastic child's voice: &quot;Yes, this is my house, thank you for helping me! Now I remember again!&quot; The friendly female narrator's voice adds: &quot;Well done...&quot; &ndash; and sends a warning afterwards: &quot;Beware, the goblin is coming!&quot;&#10;&#10;The goblin is nasty: It makes all the intersections turn. Where there was a way before is now blocked. Fortunately, there's also a good fairy who helps!&#10;&#10;"

Here are those rules, or rather a fast play version of the Channel Wargames Group's current set.&#10;&#10;&quot;The philosophy behind them is both to make an attempt to make a set of rules that give a good flavour of the period and the methods of fighting with ships current at that time. And to make the games played with them as enjoyable as is possible. Because of this things such as gunnery have been simplified as much as possible.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ships gunnery at the time of the Armada was a thing in a state of flux. It is as well to contemplate, that ships carried many different types of ordinance, all intermingled together on the same deck. The logistics of serving such a varied armament in a rapid manner was beyond the capabilities of the time, and I would hazard a guess beyond us today as well. Most authorities give a maximum rate of fire for the guns of the Spaniards as once, yes once, a day. Small pieces and hand held weapons were obviously much quicker to reload. Even the English rate of fire is said to have been at best once an hour. If this difference had been used in the rules the Spanish player's would be sitting on their for much of the game, and the English for quite long periods. The solution to this problem can be read in the rules themselves...&quot;&#10;&#10;User Summary&#10;&#10;Rules set covers scale, speed of units, sailing rules, handling classes, wind effects, firing, ranges, firing charts, special effects table (effectively a sort of critical hit table), putting out fires, effects of bowing on hull factors, boarding, morale, special rules for galleys, a ship list, and a brief bibliography. Game requires models (1/600 preferred for ease of scratch building), and two types of dice (d6 &amp; d20).&#10;&#10;Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #178 (July 2002)&#10;&#10;"

Originally a game for two, three or four players, it's mostly known today in an adapted version for two players brought into England by the Mathematics professor A.S. Besikovitch, and later included in David Parlett's Oxford Guide to Card Games. This version is played with exposed cards and symmetrical hands, giving it a strong strategic flavour.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the (Besikovitch) game each player chooses two sets without overlapping with the other player, typically in a 32-card deck, out of which one is their own trump. Cards are dealt for the first player, who keeps the cards of their both sets; the second player gets exactly the same cards in the other sets and both their hands are filled up with the rest of the cards. As an example: a player who's chosen spades and clubs with spades as trumps keeps the cards in both sets and gives all their red cards together with the undealt cards to the other player, who then selects the analog cards to the first player's in the red sets with hearts as trumps, gives the rest of the red cards back to the first player and finally keeps all the remaining black cards. Both hands are symmetrical, and play can start.&#10;&#10;From now on each turn a player lays a card in a pile between both players; before the next player can play out a card of their choice they must throw one that is superior in value to the top card in the pile or a trump. If the player can't or doesn't want to do so they must take the whole pile and forfeit the turn. So, each player throws two cards in a row: one following the previous card, and one to be followed by the opponent. The first player to get rid of all cards in their hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The colour by colour rule is meant to be for the tiles of one player. Example: Player A starts with a yellow tile. Player B continues with two green tiles. Now player A has to continue with yellow until all yellow is used. Only then player A may choose his next colour. (Same for player B with green)&#10;&#10;Each placed tile has to touch at least one tile with the same or a smaller value.  The dots of the top tiles always must be on the top side.
