7092,,The four one-map games can be played individually or as two campaign games.  Each map comprehensively details the terrain of the Ardennes in four colors.  The playing pieces have been designed with attention to historical accuracy.  The combat system is dice driven.&#10;&#10;The rulebook also contains about ten pages of historical text about the various battles.&#10;&#10;The individual folios are:&#10;&#10;     St Vith&#10;     Clervaux&#10;     Celles&#10;     Sedan&#10;&#10;&#10;

7095,,This game is very similar to Balderdash but doesn't use a board.  Each player has six betting cards.  Three cards with values from 5 - 15 labeled &quot;True&quot; and four cards with values labeled from 5 - 20 &quot;Bluff&quot;.&#10;&#10;A card is selected and four definitions are read out loud.  Three definitions are listed and the active player makes up the fourth.&#10;&#10;Players then place a bet based on one of the definitions.  The players whom have correctly predicted the result get the points they have bet.  The incorrect bets are given to the active player.  The first player to score 250 pts wins.&#10;&#10;This game has lots of cards.  672 bluff cards are included and each card has two words.&#10;&#10;

7110,,"Played on a three dimensional board game, Miners' Mountain, for two to seven players, takes you back to the mining days of the Klondike era. The object of the game is to become the wealthiest prospector.&#10;&#10;A dice roll moves your game pieces up the mountain until you reach one of the numbered mine entrances. Placing a numbered marble in the mine entrance enables player to actively mine that mine. To recover gold, a player rotates the mountain using mountain movement cards. Amount of payment for gold depends on marble landing in assayer's tray. Once paid, the player reuses the game piece, to start over climbing the mountain to mine for more gold.&#10;&#10;More advanced players can challenge each other to gunfights or steal each other's mines by claim jumping. A dice roll determines who wins a gunfight or takes over a mine.&#10;&#10;A third dimension to the game, Bushwhackers, is a game of capture. It uses the gunfight rules along with the location on the mountain to gain advantage against your opponent.&#10;&#10;"

7112,,"Often misquoted as &quot;the monster game of modern warfare&quot;, NATO Division Commander is a much-maligned SPI WWIII title that, because of being widely misunderstood, is often more studied than played.&#10;&#10;Described in the rules as a &quot;battalion level simulation of conflict in contemporary Europe&quot;, NATO Division Commander gradually introduces players to the most complex version of mechanics through a series of scenarios of increasing difficulty, the easiest of which is simple, fun, can be expanded, and should not be avoided.  When completely addressed, the game is a War College-level education on the conduct of World War III operations at Division/Brigade level between NATO and Soviet forces. The game system builds on the combat-as-part-of-movement late-SPI systems such as Next War and Fifth Corps, and has as one of its basic premises the idea that unit strength is subordinate to tactical and command considerations.&#10;&#10;Central to its uniqueness, NATO Division Commander contains two identical mapboards and rules for Controller play, producing a refereed, double-blind, fog-of-war effect which is still unique today, more than 30 years after publication.  The game includes solitaire and face-to-face rules to help controllers build up their knowledge of the game, and decide what they will include, and what slows the game down too much for their taste: thus allowing the game experience to be controlled for the players' experience and expectations. It also allows testing of scenarios before controller use.&#10;&#10;Scenarios are comprehensive and infinitely flexible, which makes demands of controllers, and offer a unique playing experience for those peering down the gun barrel.&#10;&#10;With 1200 counters, rule books, and a pile of playing aids, NATO Division Commander still is, the one true smorgasbord of World War III land-based operational simulations.&#10;&#10;"

7114,,"SOPAC: Naval Action in the Southern Pacific 1942-43, is part of Avalanche Press Ltd's Second World War at Sea series of naval battle games.  SOPAC recreates the Solomon Islands Campaign of late 1942.&#10;&#10;Like other games in the series, SOPAC uses a combination of Operational and Tactical displays, similar to those originally found in Avalon Hill's Midway, but much more detailed and accurate.  This allows for the mixture of aerial and surface combat that characterized the Pacific theater of operations.  Players must write orders and assign missions to tasks forces prior to movement, then conduct aerial searches for enemy fleets and submarines.  Frequently, forces will clash in surface battles, and players track damage, hit by hit, reducing ship capabilities and inflicting casualties.&#10;&#10;SOPAC includes 20 scenarios -- 10 Battle and 10 Operational -- allowing players to explore the early days of combat and try some what-if situations that history never explored.&#10;&#10;"

Mullin as he is listed as the copyright holder on the game board.&#10;&#10;Sail Away is played on a board resembling a nautical chart overlaid by a square grid. The game includes six metal yachts numbered 1 through 6. The yachts lean to one side or the other according to their tack. The yachts are moved across the map using the intersections of the grid lines.&#10;&#10;Movement is governed by a spinner which has an inner and outer circle of results - one circle for the upwind leg, and the other circle for the downwind and crosswind legs. In addition to the bit of luck injected by the spinner (reflecting the vagaries of the wind), there is also a slight chance for misfortune - two small spaces on the spinner allow for a player to lose a turn for having a man overboard and two turns for capsizing. The rules also cover blanketing effects by windward yachts toward leeward yachts, tacking, and jibing.&#10;&#10;The course is somewhat fixed in that the wind direction is always the same (southeast) and there are three course markers designated on the map. However, there are four different courses that may be run: counterclockwise around the triangular course described by the three markers, clockwise around the triangular course, around course marker 2 and back, or around course marker 3 and back. In addition, players may choose to race one lap or multiple laps.&#10;&#10;"

The game combines a mechanic usually reserved for smaller games -- a chit pull combat system -- with two gorgeous maps, 900 counters, and a 36-page rulebook that should have &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; inscribed on its cover (the designer was content to place the warning on the first page of rules instead).&#10;&#10;As you read the rules, you get the feeling that the designer wants to bring back the best parts of the &quot;good old days&quot; of wargaming -- that newfound excitement and thrill you once had that gradually wore off as you slogged through the complexity of the latest SPI monster. The rulebook is written almost in prose, gently explaining each rule and including historical footnotes when appropriate. Though long, it is well-organized and easily cross-referenced.&#10;&#10;The graphics are detailed but subtle, aiding play without distracting the player. A fair amount of information is packed on each counter. Player aids are plentiful.&#10;&#10;The game itself focuses on post-invasion Normandy, where the Germans are trying to delay and attrite the Allies prior to their inevitable breakout. As much of the victory depends on the Allies' ability to maintain momentum throughout the campaign as it does capturing key victory point hexes -- any signs of trench warfare or, worse, seesaw battling over villages is severely penalized.&#10;&#10;In yet another attempt to limit intelligence, the combat system includes a combat effectiveness 'chit pull' system that disguises actual unit combat strength up to the last moment. The system adds a level of uncertainty to the game that leads to unexpected combat results and tempers any tendency to attack without some forethought.&#10;&#10;Although primarily designed for two players, the game can accommodate up to four given its size and attention to detail.

At the end of the three minute timer period, the judge selects the poem that is the best match of subject and category and declares the round winner, whose playing piece moves up one space towards the freezer on the score track. The judgeship passes to the left and play continues until one player wins their fourth poem round.&#10;&#10;"

Those discarding must say &quot;Love Me&quot; and those drawing, &quot;Love Me Not&quot; else face the evil UNO penalty of drawing an additional card. Play then resumes as normal upon returning to the player intitiating the &quot;love me(not)&quot; session.&#10;&#10;"

There was a comic book about the characters used in the game, a group of five kids who each had the ability to turn into a different animal.&#10;&#10;The game is cooperative.  The kids have been placed on the planet TerraTopia and have to each find their colored stone before the planet's three moons meet (or something along those lines).  The players can choose to travel around the board together or separately.&#10;&#10;The game was designed by Peter Olotka, one of the Eon Products team, and his son Greg.  The game definitely shows some of the Eon originality in the mechanics.  The players have to recover their stones by overcoming challenges at various locations on the board.  There are a large number of possible challenges, generated by randomly placing generic challenge markers (e.g., &quot;Fog&quot;) at the various locations and having a booklet which describes exactly what Fog means at each location.  The players have to be able to explain to each other how they would use their character's &quot;powers&quot; (shape-changing and normal talents) to overcome the challenges.&#10;&#10;"

Spent gold is then used to summon all variety of mythological &quot;allies&quot; (beasts, gods, etc.), or &quot;totems&quot; (support items that remain on the table, enhancing your combat or gold producing abilities). Gold can also be kept in the reserve pile to be used to power &quot;talismans&quot; (think instants and interrupts), or to utilize special abilities that your &quot;allies&quot; have. Combat is resolved by comparing the &quot;power&quot; value on each card, if the attacker is higher, the difference is discarded from your opponent&rsquo;s deck. The first person to completely deplete their opponent's deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
