9802,,"Theme:&#10;&#10;Game is themed around a purification ritual of the ancient Etruscan people, who predated the Roman Empire around 6th century B.C.  Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On &quot;Tagete's&quot; day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;Each player has 8 pawns representing &quot;Haruspexes&quot; [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to &quot;Lasa Vecuvia&quot; with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set &quot;passages&quot; on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.&#10;&#10;Players win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Game plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or &quot;passage&quot; spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 &quot;neutral&quot; colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.&#10;&#10;At any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must &quot;sacrifice&quot; 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.&#10;&#10;If a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to &quot;seal&quot; the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors&#10;4 green wooden dice with gold pips and rounded corners&#10;1 double sided game board for 3 and 4 player games&#10;1 full color illustrated rules booklet&#10;&#10;"

Teams move around the board on rolls of the die, competing in three sub-games--Clich&eacute; Cafe, Three Perfect Words, and Calling All Players (more on these below). An additional roll is earned each time a team succeeds before time runs out. A team collects a ring by winning a sub-game while on a ring-marked space.&#10;Clich&eacute; Cafe - try to get your teammates to guess the well-known clich&eacute; using only sound effects and pantomime.&#10;Three Perfect Words - Get your teammates to guess the one word answer by giving a single spoken clue of up to three words in length (one clue, one guess).&#10;Calling All Players - All players from all teams list as many answers on a given subject category (i.e. bad habits, things women look for in a man, synonyms for the word vomit) as possible in 45 seconds. When time's up, each team earns a point for each answer all members of that team have in common.&#10;&#10;"

9858,,"&quot;The fate of the empire rests upon this one battle, let every man do his utmost.&quot;&#10;&#10;Admiral Togo addressing the Japanese Fleet 27 May 1905&#10;&#10;Dawn of the Rising Sun contains 20 scenarios covering all the major surface engagements of the Russo-Japanese War that led to this stunning reversal of fortunes. Using the same rules as Fear God & Dread Nought, a novice can begin playing within a half hour of opening the box using the specially designed Jump start scenario.&#10;&#10;Dawn of the Rising Sun follows the same format as Clash of Arm's other rules used in the Admiralty Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike.&#10;&#10;Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds fired at the target, and the speed of the firing and target platforms.&#10;&#10;Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical hits are a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits are typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon mounts).&#10;&#10;Each scenario has its own map, showing the disposition of forces. In addition to the well known battles such as Port Arthur, Yellow Sea, and Tsushima Strait, several smaller battles are included. The scenario book is full of original after action reports as well as helpful sidebars on a wide range of topics. The Data Annex is complete for all the ships that were involved, as well as including line drawings of the major combatants and additional source material, making it a valuable reference in itself.&#10;&#10;Step onto the Admiral's bridge and see if you will sustain or reverse history.&#10;&#10;Russo-Japanese War contains:&#10;FG&amp;DN Rules&#10;RJW Data Annex&#10;Scenario Book - 20 scenarios plus numerous sidebars and articles.&#10;2 countersheets, 210 ship, and 140 markers (land based guns, searchlights, fires, torpedoes, etc.)&#10;&#10;"
