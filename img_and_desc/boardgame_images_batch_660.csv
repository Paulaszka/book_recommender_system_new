Each player begins with a certain amount of points and one of the players thinks a word, placing on the table as many &quot;?&quot; counters as letters in the word. Then players take turns to guess a letter in the word; if the guess is incorrect, the player must pay one point. At any time, a player can guess the hidden word: if correct she wins as many points as &quot;?&quot; counters still on the table plus 2; if not, she must pay two points.&#10;&#10;"

Then they take a long string with a bead tied to one end, drop the bead at the start point of a map, and slowly lower the string, attempting to draw a line with it from start to end while connecting the goals and avoiding the obstacles. Crossing (or capturing) a goal gives points, while touching an obstacle subtracts points. If a player runs out of string before they reach the end point, they score zero for that map. After playing through several maps, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Bible&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play.

Steam Court is a 1&ndash;12 player card game that mixes elements of traditional trick-taking, with character based abilities and victory point win conditions.&#10;&#10;Steam Court is a game of Victorian hierarchy where the more powerful your position, the greater your opportunity in the game. You'll want to try and hold onto the throne, but don't play your cards right and you'll end up serving the lousy Tea Boy. Each round, players rotate position at the table, and depending on their seat they gain/lose privileges. Even though the game is stacked in favor of those at the top, the luck of the deal, use of special cards, and player strategy are guaranteed to make it interesting.&#10;  &#10;There are multiple variations on how to play, but the typical game involves four rounds of cards and usually takes around 60 minutes.&#10; The original artwork, intriguing theme, and clever game play will have you ratcheting for the top in Steam Court.&#10;&#10;Goal: get rid of the cards in your hand before other players do. There are many strategies you can employ do this, but the most common is to be the controlling player to start the trick. The player who wins the trick starts the next trick. This allows you to decide how many cards of the same number you will play. Then all other players must match the quantity of cards played and also beat the number that is on the cards. For example, if a player lays three 1s, then the next player must lay three cards of a higher number - like three 2s or three 3s. What gives this game an extra dimension are the variable character privileges. Each Engineer is granted a different privilege by their Courtier that can be employed at the beginning of the Quarter or throughout the game. For example, the Duke can lay matching numbered cards instead of having to play higher numbered cards on a set of cards.&#10;&#10;End of the Quarter: After everyone's cards have been played the Quarter ends and players re-seat based on the order they went out in (first player out becomes the Queen, and so on). They then gain the privileges of a different character for the next Quarter.&#10;&#10;7-12 players: When playing with a large group a new element is added to the game -- a second table full of Renegades. Players who do poorly in the Royal Court are banished to the Renegade table, while the top two engineers at the Renegade Table are promoted to the Royal Court. In Steam Court, anything can happen. The lowest of low can climb to the top, or the Queen&rsquo;s engineer can wind up working for the vagabond.&#10;&#10;"

Dandy has gone and used the Aloha Oe's broken warp drive and managed to converge every possible alternate universe into one, causing multiple copies of everyone in the known galaxies to run amok! What does this mean for our intrepid heroes? Will all semblance of civilization fall into disorder and chaos? Will the universe, under the weight of so many simultaneous timelines, implode on itself into a cosmic Big Bang?&#10;&#10;Well. Maybe. But for now it means the Alien Registration Center has reset the database and is allowing new registration of all previously registered aliens! That's cold, hard Woolong just out there for the taking, baby!&#10;&#10;The Space Dandy: Galactic Deck-Building Game brings the bizarre space-faring antics of the hit anime series seen on ADULT SWIM TOONAMI to the game table. It's similar to other Deck-Builders like Dominion and Ascension&mdash;with an extra helping of phantom space ramen goodness. Each player begins the game with the same rather low-powered starting cards, but through careful play, you can acquire more to expand your options. Which cards you choose to take directly influence the kind of game you play!&#10;&#10;Cards can grant new abilities, make it easier to acquire new cards, allow you to take extra turns, or even destroy cards from the game altogether! But the most important cards are the aliens. Not only can they improve your hand just like any other card, they can be played Planetside and directly attack the other Player. Why fiddle around endlessly with your deck when you can stick it to them and mess up their carefully laid plans? That's the Dandy way to play!&#10;&#10;Even more importantly, aliens are how you win! When you register aliens, they are removed from play, but you get to score precious, precious Woolong that you need to win the game. But be careful! It can be difficult to decide if an alien is more useful in your hand, on the Planet, or in the Alien Registration Center's bank.&#10;&#10;That&rsquo;s not to say the other cards aren&rsquo;t important, too! Effect Cards cannot be registered OR played Planetside, but they let you manipulate the game to your advantage. Sick of that really great card the opponent keeps playing? DESTROY IT! Changed your mind about the card you played Planetside? WARP IT BACK! Keep your opponent&rsquo;s on their toes with your carefully constructed (or hazardously haphazard) deck!&#10;&#10;You can also fill out your space crew with other humans (and the occasional robot) that can&rsquo;t be registered as aliens (obviously). But never fear! They make up for the lack of Woolong delivery with unique abilities of their own!&#10;&#10;So register those aliens, earn all the Woolong you can, and may the Best Dandy Win!&#10;&#10;"

declaration.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#140;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#142;&#168;&#231;&#144;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#150;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;1&#239;&#189;&#158;14&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#155;&#184;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;14&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#128;&#129;12&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#157;&#135;&#231;&#173;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#174;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#164;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#229;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#231;&#139;&#172;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#138;&#185;&#230;&#158;&#156;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#178;&#161;&#229;&#174;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#154;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#230;&#137;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#150;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#155;&#184;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#142;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#231;&#148;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#233;&#154;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#184;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#141;&#129;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#162;&#186;&#228;&#191;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#174;&#163;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#154;&#151;&#229;&#143;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#230;&#173;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;1&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#178;&#187;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#2

You must balance your efforts between sponsoring knights (who may yield you honor and glory) and managing the subtle manipulations of the king&rsquo;s court after each day&rsquo;s battles.&#10;&#10;Lavish the powerful with gifts, ply the gullible with a tapestry of empty promises, publicly humiliate your rivals, or back the people&rsquo;s champion in the arena -- nothing matters except royal favor, and if your enemies are dragged down in the process, well&hellip; they knew the risks.&#10;&#10;King's Tournament is a card-driven game that sets a random assortment of unique knights onto a play mat styled after a single-elimination tournament. Gameplay centers around the ebb and flow of two recurring phases: the action- and auction-based Festival Round and the card dueling-oriented Tournament Round.&#10;&#10;Festival Rounds are play-or-pass affairs wherein players use actions, cards, tokens, and written abilities to sponsor knights, sabotage their foes, or benefit from the tournament in more subtle ways. The Tournament Round follows, during which the knights battle one another using their printed attributes and special maneuver cards played by their patrons. Victorious knights advance further down the bracket, and a new Festival Round begins afterward.&#10;&#10;Play continues until a single knight has been crowned the tournament's champion, at which point players compare the favor tokens earned over the course of the game. Bonuses are doled out for reaching certain conditions, and the player with the most favor tokens is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Hide ingredients to deceive opponents, and use magical powers to mix concoctions. But beware - your opponents are brewing schemes of their own!&#10;&#10;Apotheca is played on a 4x4 grid. Players gain points by making matches of three potions of the same color in a row. The first player to make three matches wins.

Games take anywhere from 15 - 45 minutes, depending on how many people are playing. The game works on a system of sharing decks. I.e., instead of everyone bringing separate decks, there are three decks in each copy of the game from which every player draws. Specifically, Cards: The Attackening! consists of an Attackener deck (characters); Arsenal deck (Pets, Weapons, Armor, Evasions, and miscellaneous Items); and Twists of Fate (scenarios that affect gameplay - e.g., SciFi Attackeners gain a certain advantage while attacking.).&#10;&#10;The game is played by every player drawing three Attackeners, three Arsenal cards, playing their first Attackener and then rolling to see who draws and plays the first Twist of Fate. The player with the highest roll chooses three Twists of Fate, and choosing the one that benefits them the most. That player then draws one Arsenal card, plays one, and attacks an opponent by rolling a die. Damage is determined by the amount rolled (1 is a miss, 2 is half damage, 3-5 is full, and 6 is double). If the opponent does not evade the attack, they take the damage and the move is passed to the next player, who follows the above steps to complete their turn.&#10;&#10;When an Attackener's health is depleted, the person who beat that Attackener collects the card as a trophy. The person who was beaten chooses the next Twist of Fate, but does not play their next Attackener until it is their turn to play. This gives them a few rounds of immunity while play continues. The game is over when one player has collected three trophies from any player in the game.&#10;&#10;"
