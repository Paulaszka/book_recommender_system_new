It recalls the most decisive battles fought in Europe, Africa and Asia from the beginning of the invasion of Ethiopia, in summer 1936 until the dramatic end in Berlin in spring 1945. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for two or more players, up to 6: one/three control the Allies, and the other one/three control Germany and the other Axis powers. &#10;The game is furthermore suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, a play with Fog of War is suggested.&#10;&#10;Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over an astonishing 125x87 cm (49&quot;x34&quot;) full laminated multicolor mapboard, the only paper component in the box is the rules manual. In total, more than 600 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time:&#10;&bull; The Basic Game Rules introduce the basic concepts and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;&bull; The Advanced Game Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.&#10;&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Technology Research, Strategic Warfare with the bombing of Germany and U-boat campaigns in the oceans, Amphibious Landings, Airborne Assaults, and more.&#10;&#10;In TIME OF DECISIONS, a hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 km) across, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally corps size) with 300 planes, 300 tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc. The game can be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent) or off (all units are visible).&#10;&#10;Players can compete starting from 1936 Campaign, in one of four six-turn scenarios or one of the shorter, easy-to-learn scenarios. Each scenario has different victory conditions and length, with a playing time from 1 to 99 turns.&#10;&#10;"

The map of the Confederacy is divided into areas. The U.S player must strangle the Confederacy and reduce their will to continue fighting. Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate armies (three Confederate and up to six Union) for movement and combat. Units can fight enemy armies in the same area. Combat is done by rolling 1D6, adding  combat strength (for the Union) or Resistance Level (for the Confederates) and comparing results. Highest result wins. Losses are taken in retreats or in step losses.&#10;&#10;There are up to eight turns, each of which is six months. The key mechanic is the Confederate Resistance Level (CRL). As Union armies occupy areas, the CRL falls. If the CRL falls to zero before the end of turn 8, the Union player wins, otherwise the Confederate player wins.&#10;&#10;"

Players first decide which racetrack to use on the double-sided player boards. Then they start racing!&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player rolls the five dice, sets aside any she wants to keep, then rolls up to two more times, rerolling dice set aside, if desired. The dice depict curves or straights in three different colors, and after the player stops rolling, she chooses all the dice of one color and must use all of them to move on the track. Colored track on the player board can be moved through only with dice of the appropriate color, while any die color can be used to cross gray track; if a player can't use all movement for a color, she must choose a different color. A player cannot cross the same square twice. End your movement in a tight corner, and you take another turn immediately.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until one reaches the finish line, which triggers the final round. After all players have taken the same number of turns, whoever has driven the farthest across the finish line wins. Variants in the rulebook include an option for oil slicks that take two dice to cross, a point system for a multi-race world championship, and a two lap race on the Indianapolis board that includes a shortcut. The challenge in this latter race is that you're still restricted from crossing the same square twice. Take special care the first time around, or else you'll be weaving like a maniac on lap two!&#10;&#10;"

There exist many card games for enhanced learning. A unique feature of this card game is that it consists of plastic adjustable headbands worn on the foreheads of each player. This feature makes it fun and exciting to learn about the Bible. More specifically this game relates to a method of learning about people, places and things found in the Bible in a fun and unique way. It has been said that a family that prays together stays together. I would also like to think that a family that plays together stays together. Therefore, it is the purpose of this game to bring goups of people together in the form of family, friends, or other small groups to learn about the Bible in this fun unique way, increasing ones Bible knowledge, vocabulary, and their faith in the Bible and in God. Churches and Sunday school teachers are always looking for new, fun and creative ways to teach their students about the Bible. This game will satisfy that need.&#10;&#10;Each Biblebanz game comes with 6 headbands, 94 Bible cards, 6 blank cards, 24 chips and a timer.&#10;&#10;This game is a game for the whole family for ages 7 and up. It is for 2 to 6 players. The Biblebanz Game Cards features things found in the Bible. Examples are: animals, food, people and bible objects. Examples are: Jesus, Noah, Ark, Fig tree, apple, church and so forth. The cards are simple enough for the whole family to join in on the fun. Each round only lasts one minute. At the start of the round you have to start the sand timer. As the time runs out, the player whose turn it is must ask yes or no questions to figure out what his card is. This will help to increase your Bible knowledge and Bible vocabulary. It's very entertaining to say the least. There are 6 blank cards to be used with a dry erase marker. These blank cards are great for young children who need easy words or Bible schoolars who want harder words to figure out. You can write whatever word you want out of the Bible on them. You will never run out of words to use this way.&#10;&#10;Rules Of The Game:&#10;&#10;The rules of Biblebanz are simple. Each player is dealt a single card and three chips. The player&rsquo;s must then place the card on their headband without looking. The youngest player goes first. Then, play passes to the left. Set the one minute timer. Next, start asking questions in yes or no format. If you've found out your identity, you just ask, &ldquo;Am I ________?&rdquo; Fill in the blank with what you think you are. For each identity that you guess correctly, you discard one of your chips. If you guess your identity before the one minute timer runs out, take another card and put it in your headband. If you do not guess your identity before the timer runs out, then keep it and continue to guess on your next turn. The person to get rid of all of his or her chips is the Biblebanz winner! It's so much fun!&#10;&#10;Great for birthday parties, bridal showers, Christian retreats, sleep overs, children's church, youth groups, Bible study groups, and more!&#10;&#10;Biblebanz is a trademark of Christian Book And Toys LLC. &copy;2012 Christian Book And Toys LLC.

The game focuses primarily on the role of strategic bombers, but other types of supporting aircraft such as Interceptors, Airborne Early Warning aircraft, and Aerial Refueling Tankers are also represented.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;Red Menace&quot; was used during the Cold War by the U.S. because it was believed that thousands of Soviet bombers could be unleashed at a moment's notice. This turned out not to be true as the Soviets had several hundred bombers at best, and many had significant range limitations. The game is not meant to be an accurate simulation of the actual capabilities of the strategic forces involved, but rather reflects what the governments and citizens of the U.S., Canada, and the UK believed could happen.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of fifteen phases played in order from drawing random events, deploying and moving Soviet flights, intercepting flights, submarine operations and more. Reference sheets are included to make tracking the game progress easier. Decisions for the Soviet units are made by the game system using random events and dice. The player simply moves the Soviet bombers towards their assigned targets. Scenarios are included with various starting positions, targets, and actions for Soviet, United States, and United Kingdom bombers.&#10;&#10;The game complexity is easy, but optional rules are included to make it more challenging. The winner of a scenario is determined by the points scored from attacking the opponent's cities. Points are awarded by a random chit draw after each successful attack. A typical scenario requires fifty points to win.&#10;&#10;"

Each tile depicts a stacked arrangement of blocks as well as a point value. On a turn, the master builder takes the sixteen tower blocks, flips the sand timer, then starts building whichever towers he wishes, with each tower being built on the tile that depicts it. Each other player is a saboteur and has 2-10 ammunition dice that she tries to shoot at the towers with her catapult (which is more like a tiny teeter-totter really). If she knocks over a tower, great! No points for the master builder, although he can use the fallen blocks to rebuild if time remains. If an ammunition die lands on a tower tile, the builder can't build on this tile; if he's started building on this tile but hasn't finished, he must stop and move elsewhere.&#10;&#10;If an ammunition die lands with the &quot;Ka-Boom&quot; symbol face-up, nothing happens. However, if a second die shows this symbol, the player who shot this die gets to slam her fist on the table once; if the ensuing earthquake knocks over towers, too bad for the builder. One player has a giant ammunition die, and this can cause an earthquake all on its own, but saboteurs can't cause more than one earthquake a round.  [Note:  The Blue Orange version of the game removes the earthquake mechanic and giant ammunition die.]&#10;&#10;When the sand timer runs out, the master builder claims any tiles on which he has correctly built a tower that still stands. The next player in clockwise order then becomes the new master builder. As soon as a player reaches 16 points, the game ends and he wins!&#10;&#10;"

This game takes place several weeks into the infection at a point where the zombies seem to have the upper hand; not only in numbers but also in mutated ability. Four humans surviving together have taken refuge in a country side manor. On the run, down to just knives and pistols, and being stalked by countless zombies that are leading a monster directly to them, the survivors hold themselves up and wait for rescue within the halls of the zombie manor.&#10;&#10;The game pits a team of 4 survivors against a team of zombies; each team consists of at least 1 player per side with up to 4 players on each team.  The game takes place on a grid based board detailing the basement, first floor, 2nd floor, and grounds of an abandoned manor.&#10;&#10;The goal of the survivor team is to hold out within the manor grounds for 20 rounds at which point a rescue vehicle spawns. They must then make it to the rescue vehicle with at least 2 survivors making it to safety in order to win.  The survivor team can scavenge for items, barricade doors and windows with furniture and wood, and seek out strategic locations within the manor or its grounds to help aid them through the game (60+ weapons, health items, equipment, zombie traps, and weapon upgrades).&#10;&#10;Alternatively, the survivor team can kill the zombie team boss character, The Harvester, thereby ending the zombie teams ability to spawn more zombies.  Once all zombies are cleared the survivor team wins.&#10;&#10;The goal of the zombie team is to kill all of the survivor characters in order to win.  The zombie team gains 'spawn points' at the beginning of every round that can be saved up or spent on the 7 different classes of zombies available.  Each class costs a varying number of spawn points depending on their stats: movement speed, health, attack dmg, and special ability.  The zombie team also controls a zombie boss character, The Harvester.  The Harvester is the strongest and most versatile zombie of the game but if it is destroyed the zombie team can no longer spawn zombies.&#10;&#10;"

It is an intuitive game where children learn the rules quickly and can create new rules and possibilities, from the original. &#10;First, each player positions the numbered tokens (1 to 6). In your turn you roll the die; only the token with the same number can be moved. When a token pass the goal line, the player scores.&#10;&#10;"

The players take on one of four roles, Mad Scientist Dr. Victor von Mechanstein, Sergeant Roger Stammel, OSI Agent Cynthia Collins or henchmech E-Gore Mk.IV.&#10;&#10;Gameplay progresses in turns with each player moving their token(s) then resolving attacks before play passes to the next player. Each unit has a set movement rate and attacks are resolved by rolling a six-sided die (D6) and then comparing the number rolled to the range and the target's armor.&#10;&#10;Each character has two of its own, often opposing, goals. One goal is active and ends the game on the turn it is achieved, and the other goal is passive and is only checked after 10 turns have been played. Mechanstein wants to prevent his tanks from being taken off the island, Stammel simply wants to escape with his soldiers, Collins wants intelligence on the Mad Scientist's forces and E-gore wants to please its master by recapturing the prisoners.&#10;&#10;Each turn the tank players move toward the beach as more and more robots appear to stop them.&#10;&#10;The action is modified by two sets of cards: Mad Scientist Events and Tanker Tactics. Events are large scale effects that change the game in some way or affect all the players tics are short and Tactics are minor effects that can give a boost to many actions as well as repair damage, improve speed or even find a new tank if one has been destroyed.&#10;&#10;The playing area itself consists of 7 hexagonal tiles with a hex-grid printed on them. One tile is Mechanstein's volcanic lair and the other six are unique combinations of roads, cliffs, forests and open terrain. The non-volcano tiles can be rotated to any orientation and placed into one of several formations and are designed in such a way to always have the roads match up.&#10;&#10;"

It was a silver coin, a bit larger than a dime, bearing the image of the reigning emperor and denarii (plural form of denarius) have been found bearing the image of all 12 Roman emperors.  While competing in the game, you will be given 12 denarii to help you along.&#10;&#10;On your turn you role two custom dice and move your marker farther along the track on the board.  Depending on what color you land on you will be asked a different question from the trivia book.  Answer correct and you stay where you are, answer incorrectly and you must return to the last denarii space that you passed or pay a denarii from your supply.  To land on the last space you must role the exact number of spaces needed to get there or you can move backwards to give yourself more room.&#10;&#10;Denarii was created to help individuals, groups and especially families increase their Bible knowledge and have fun together at the same time.  Learning is the main purpose, but there is competition, strategy, challenge and lots of excitement, too.&#10;Even if a player does not give all correct answers, he will learn from others and could still be the winner of the game! There is little advantage for the Bible scholar.  Everyone who plays will learn and want to play again!&#10;&#10;"
