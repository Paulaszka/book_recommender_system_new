It addresses former Midgard RPG players, who don't find the time for role playing anymore, as well as fans of fantasy boardgames. As the complexity level is rather high and the game offers multiple options for players, Midgard is rather successful in achieving it's goal. The difficulty is still light to medium, despite dozens of cards that influence the game and the characters.&#10;&#10;The game is based on tiles (major cities of Midgard) players move across, collecting rare items and fulfilling adventures. Often this ends in the local city jail or in clashes with monsters. Additional threats like terror cards or riots pop up in cities during the game.&#10;&#10;Tests are made with a 20-sided die and the mechanics are just the same as in the Midgard RPG. Movement and actions are controlled by action cards from a four-card-hand which allows tactical gaming. Each action card has different abilities and some may even interrupt another player's turn.&#10;&#10;Players may form groups for the duration of a game turn to help each other solve adventures or make difficult tests. Sticking together earns each player of a group experience points and treasure cards. As only one player can finally win the game, forming groups is a two-edged sword as it helps your opponents too. The goal of the game is to get 3 treasure rewards, rise to character level 3 and find 2 artifacts first. If you deliver the treasures and artifacts to the correct city you have won the game.&#10;&#10;Included are pre-generated characters like Sorcerer or Warrior but players will be able to create their own characters in the final release version.&#10;&#10;This information is derived from the website of Phantastische-Spielewelten.&#10;&#10;http://www.phantastische-spielewelten.de&#10;&#10;"

The one with the most &quot;votes&quot; in the end gets elected to high scool president and thus wins the game.&#10;&#10;It's a humour-based, hilarious but rather complicated card game where a lot of the enjoyment relies on you knowing the clich&eacute;es in japanese animation concerning high school comedy. Though there's a lot of japanese text on the cards, it's playable without knowledge of japanese if you have a translation sitting nearby. Moreover, you learn what the cards do rather quickly.&#10;&#10;Game description&#10;There are two card piles: the play card pile and the &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile. The &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile contains only cards with a number of votes, 1 to 6 on each card. The play card pile consists of special vote cards (can be worth a lot, and also may have special powers), action cards (that affect other players) or event cards (all players have to sumbit to certain conditions).&#10;&#10;At your turn, you draw a play card and (unless it's an event card wich affets all players) may either take 2 actions OR draw yet another game card. Actions include drawing a standard vote card, playing a game card from your hand, or using a special power (from your special vote card or your character).&#10;&#10;The &quot;standard vote&quot; cards are kept hidden, people can see how many you have but not how much they're worth. The special vote cards however, (which are worth much, representing votes from whole clubs like the baseball team, the newpaper club and so on), are placed before you. These can be &quot;attacked&quot; by action cards, either nullified or stolen. Some action cards can cancel other action cards, and some special votes cards can be immune to attacks like these if you discard cards from your hand etc.&#10;&#10;So the game goes on until you've taken 2 laps through the draw pile of game cards. When the fourth event card is drawn, game ends immediately, and the person with most votes win.&#10;&#10;As said, much of the flavour of this game consists of clich&eacute;es in high school anime. The names of the standard vote-cards are sometimes hilarious. Some one-vote cards are named &quot;the ghost girl who nobody has ever seen&quot;, &quot;the maid robot&quot;, &quot;the one who secretly goes to a certain market selling certain home made comics&quot;, other cards include &quot;the I don't know whatever&quot; (3 votes), &quot;the ones with a boyfriend&quot; (2 votes), &quot;the diet girls&quot; (4 votes) et cetera. The special vote cards are typical high school clubs in japanese high schools.&#10;&#10;A very nice game but probably only for those who enjoy the style.&#10;&#10;"
