The game is won by capturing all of your opponents' Sparks or preventing your opponent from moving.&#10;&#10;The power or value of a Spark is determined by the number of Orbs it is aligned with; a Spark can only capture another with equal or lesser power.&#10;&#10;Similarly, the mobility of an Orb is determined by the number of Sparks it is aligned with; An Orb can move as many spaces as the number of Sparks it is aligned with.&#10;&#10;"

Every 3 turns this disk turns and the wind will be coming from a new direction. A ship always moves in a straight line that can be at a diagonal. If it is sailing in the direction of the wind it must move 4 spaces. If in a diagonal with the wind it must move 5 spaces. If perpendicular to the wind movement is 3 spaces. If diagonal against the wind movement is 2 spaces and if against the wind 1 space. The wind rotates in a rigid sequence so you can always plan what your ship will be doing. If a ship runs onto land it is sunk. A ship can stop short of its full movement if it is in a harbor square of which each island has one. On the outer islands this is where a galleon picks up treasures and each may carry up to 3. The board wraps around on itself so if a ship sails off an edge it reappears on the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;There are 6 dark areas on the seas that can become storms. The start player rolls 2 die at the beginning of his turn and puts a marker on the corresponding areas. Ships cannot enter these and ships that are in these areas cannot move.&#10;&#10;Each player also has a frigate. Frigates attempt to pass over another ship, regardless of the type, which will sink it. A sunken ship will always reappear at that player&rsquo;s island at the start of his next turn. Frigates may not dock at harbors so they cannot end their movement short when passing over one. Ships sunk have their treasures returned to the bank.&#10;&#10;You play until a player has collected an agreed to amount of treasures. The rules suggest 8 to 20.&#10;&#10;The rules take up 3 small pages of which half the page is rules in another language. There are also 4 illustrations in the rules so you end up with about 1 page of rules. Some things are very vague though. How the Disk of Winds is used is not very clear. Here logic can get you through. The islands in the center are not marked as belonging to anyone so I have always had each player put a treasure on one to claim it. We have also played that the islands belong to no one player and you just need to get you treasures to an island. This makes it a lot easier to dock and drop off treasures.&#10;&#10;"

It is very similar to the basic Checkers game.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players may only move in a diagonal direction. If a player's piece cannot move to a square, as an opponent's piece is occupying it, the piece is instead moved to the following diagonal square and the opponent's piece is removed from the board (captured). If the following space has another piece in it, the aforementioned move cannot be made. If, in capturing a piece, you are in a position to capture another piece, you may do so until no further pieces can be captured. This is the only time multiple moves may be taken per turn.&#10;&#10;Quad Checkers differs from the original game in that, adjacent to each edge of the board, is an additional 8x3 grid. This is the starting point of the playing pieces for each of the 4 players. From here, pieces move out into the main grid where the competitive play takes place.&#10;&#10;The game is lost for a player if he/she cannot move or if all of his/her pieces are eliminated from the board.&#10;&#10;"

This baseball game is for people who like meat and potatoes with a side of greens. It is the whole enchilada. When playing it you will use your intuition or feel to pick up patterns leading to decisions to outwit your opponent. If you can deal with, &quot;Take that!&quot;, you will like this game. Baseball Strategy is not meant for the shy, but the hearty. Great baseball action. Thrilling too! Never a dull moment and you will actually feel like a batter or a pitcher, manager or a base coach, etc. when you play this game.  Then you can live out your fantasies of being a big-league ball player! At least that's the idea is promoting here and what's wrong with that? Let's face it. Even if you just played wiffle ball in your backyard, haven't you fantasied hitting one into the upper deck at Tiger Stadium, especially having seen a slugger do that many times in your life? It would be nice to hear the cheers as you formally rounded the bases with alacrity to score. Baseball Strategy seems to capture the psychological battle between pitcher and batter quite well. Experience the excitement of getting a bases loaded, bases clearing double when you anticipated the pitch correctly, but you will also experience the agony when you don't! This game is unlike any other baseball game this author has ever played. There are rules for series play in order to give proper rest to pitchers where the entire pitching staff is used and not just the &quot;Aces&quot;.  Series play is highly recommended to have a full &quot;baseball fantasy&quot; playing experience. The game now even has variant injury possibilities, video replay challenges, robs of hit opportunities, MLB Defensive &quot;Leather Larceny&quot; Highlight Plays, setting the infield at DP depth and more.&#10;This fantasy is a cat and mouse game (and vice versa) hiding in plain sight where the two gamers enter a complex matrix of double blind decisions that lead to the inevitable think and counter-think, out witting duel.  Gamers begin by first selecting their lineups from imaginary players or actual players by converting their stats to the game's parameters. (This is easily done from mlb.com on the net or baseball-reference.com.).  If you don&rsquo;t like agony, this game isn&rsquo;t for you!&#10;Enter The Matrix: The Defensive team is the manager and catcher, selecting pitch types (Fast Ball, Off Speed, Pitch out, etc.) to send batters fuming back to the dugout, sometimes with specific outs in a certain situation. Batters attempt to get a hit, get on base or at the least make an out that moves runners into scoring position/ or of course, scoring. (that's the idea, right?) Each tries to anticipate the other's tendencies throughout the game in order to &quot;exploit&quot; them.&#10;After a pitch card is played by the pitcher, the batter must then select a type of offense/ball in play strategy (Steal, Bunt, Hit and Run, Long Ball, etc.)The results of the two choices are found by cross indexing them on a result matrix table. Players can decide on the size of ballpark before the game.&#10;&#10;"

While the front line surges east to west across the peninsula, both sides commit airborne and seaborne Special Forces and Marines as well as their Air Forces to deep penetrations into enemy territory.

The surprise attack was executed as planning by two Panzer groups, commanded by Colonel Generals Hoth and Guderian. The Soviet commander of the Western Front forces, General Pavlov, was taken completely by surprise, and, by order of the Soviet Supreme Command, dispatched his mobile forces directly into the German pincers. Most of the Soviet forces, including the mobile reserves, were thrown into disarray by the German first strike and were eliminated piecemeal.&#10;&#10;On June 28 the Germans closed their first major pocket of the war in the east. It extended from Belostok (Bialystok) to Minsk. 287,000 Soviet troops surrendered in this pocket, and in addition 2585 tanks and 1449 guns were captured. By July 3 the German forces had swept Belorussia of Soviet resistance with the single exception of the garrison at the fortress at Brest.

4027,,"[for more information on this game and to play online, visit www.allumbra.com]&#10;&#10;Lost in the ancient Celtic migration across Europe, this game was played between the clan chieftains to resolve disputes peacefully rather than resort to a costly and bloody war. It was played on a swatch of ornamental cloth familiar to this day as a &quot;plaid&quot;. Instead of stones used in the traditional game, this variation presented here uses dice as the playing pieces.&#10;&#10;To win at Breacan - and thus resolve the dispute in your favor, you must be the first to weave a path from one side of the Breacan to the opposite side.&#10;&#10;Placing the dice&#10;On your turn, place two of your four rolled dice. After your turn has ended, two more dice will be automatically rolled to replace the two you rolled.&#10;&#10;Dice can be placed in two ways:&#10;1. They can be placed on a square of your own color (e.g. red on red) when that square has no vertical or horizontal neighbors.&#10;2. They can be placed on any square as long as each adjacent (horizontally or vertically) neighboring die of your color is either one higher or one lower than the die being placed. Note: 6 can be placed next to a 1 and 1 next to a 6.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;The first player to complete a path from top to bottom or from side to side is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

4029,,Players write their 5 best answers to questions on cards... i.e. 'Name 5 fictional characters you would like to invite to dinner.' Players then compare answers and tally matches and non-matches. There are 15 questions per game. The player with the lowest difference in matches and non-matches though the fun of the game is mostly found in the interesting conversations and debates that always follow each question.&#10;&#10;

Stronger animals can eat weaker ones, but the rat can defeat the elephant by crawling into its ear. Interest is added to the board by a river (navigable only by the rat, but the lion and tiger can leap across it) and pitfalls (which make all animals vulnerable to attack by weaker ones). Sets can be bought cheaply in many Chinese shops; some have rules in English. This is not a deep intellectual exercise, but a strategic game that can be enjoyed even by young children.&#10;&#10;"

It can be thought of as a puzzle, with square pieces, that has multiple solutions.&#10;&#10;On one side of the tiles, the &quot;Rosetta&quot;, 1-3 players work together to make a 6x6 square picture. When complete, the picture shows different coloured flowers, each made up of two corresponding square pieces. You may choose to use the 4 joker tiles as wild cards.&#10;&#10;On the other side, &quot;Puncola&quot;, you are creating a 6x6 square picture by matching the edges of the tiles with a similar pattern on an adjacent tile. At the corners of certain tiles is a 1/4 circle that is paired with 3 other tiles to form a complete circle.&#10;&#10;&quot;Domino-Puncola&quot; is an alternate version of the game that adds competition. Each player picks 5 tiles at random and, in turn, tries to match an edge of the &quot;Puncola&quot; side to a tile on the table. If that person cannot place his/her tile, he/she draws a new one. The first person to place all of his/her tiles is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

This game is a little different: you're dealt a hand of cards with words on them, each with a point value. When it's your turn, construct the headline that earns the highest points... and often the biggest laughs! The first player to get to 500 points wins. If more than one player earns 500 points when the hand's points are totaled, the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Each round, players are dealt 5 cards. They may discard and replace up to 3 three of them, and then each one makes a sensible headline with the cards in their hand. The value of the headline is doubled for anyone using an &quot;Exclusive&quot; card. The first player to reach 500 points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;"
