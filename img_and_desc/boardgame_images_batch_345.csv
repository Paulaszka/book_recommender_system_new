Deal is determined randomly.  There are four phases in each round.  In the first phase, five cards are dealt.  The player to the dealer's left bids on how many tricks she can take.  Bidding continues for all players, clockwise, until the dealer is reached.  The dealer can then bid any number of cards, EXCEPT whatever number would make the total number of bids equal to the number of cards dealt.  For example, in the first phase of a four player game, player one bids 2, player two bids 0, and player three bids 2.  Player four can then bid any number but 1, as that would equal five total bids, which is the number of cards dealt.&#10;&#10;The player sitting to the dealer's left also throws the first card.  Tricks are taken by the highest numerical card.  The Excuse can either be played as a &quot;win trick&quot; or &quot;lose trick&quot;.  Players who bid correctly gain 10 points, those one trick off from their bid score 0, those two tricks off score -10, those three tricks off score -20, those four tricks off score -30, and those five tricks off score -40.&#10;&#10;Phases in odd numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 5 cards, 4 cards, 3 cards, 2 cards, and 1 card placed on the forehead for all players but the card holder to see.  Even numbered rounds are dealt as follows: 2 cards placed on the forehead, 3 cards, 4 cards, and 5 cards.  The deal changes between each round.  When 2 cards are placed on the forehead, cards are still played singly, with the first card chosen randomly.&#10;&#10;Game length is variable, but typically ends after everyone has dealt twice.  The player with the most points wins.  In the event of a tie, a final two cards are dealt and placed on the foreheads of the tied players.  The final places are determined by the outcome of that hand.&#10;&#10;"

The box says it's a &quot;fascinating game&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each corner or the game board is marked - Bill, Button, Nannie, or Stubbie. There is a double-armed spinner.&#10;&#10;Each player selects two men of the same colour and places them in the corner to his right on the board. The aim is to get both men into the centre of the board first.&#10;&#10;The player with lowest sum total on the spinner starts the game.  Each player must spin a 5 on one arm of the spinner, or a total of 5, to move. Double 5s means he can move both men.&#10;&#10;A man moves out on a 5, then forward as many spaces as shown on the other arm of the spinner. Once out, the man is moved according to the numbers on one or both arms of the spinner. Certain spaces on the board allow a player to split the total of his spinner count. Exact count on both arms of the spinner is required to bring a man home.&#10;&#10;Landing on an opponent means he is &quot;butted off&quot; and has to start again, while the &quot;butt-er&quot; man moves forward 20 spaces. Like Ludo, if a player manages to get both men on the same space it is called a Block and no other player can pass. There are penalty spaces on the board (miss a turn, go back). Spinning a double allows a second turn. Three consecutive doubles sends the man closest to the centre of the board home again. And there are a few other rules to apply during play.&#10;&#10;"

Your goal is to figure out the space monster&rsquo;s weaknesses and stop it before it eats everyone on the space station &ndash; including you! This brings up an important point: The game is actually only mostly cooperative. if things get really dire, you can make a run for the sole one-person escape pod. If you escape and the monster eats everyone else, you win!&#10;&#10;During play, you search the outpost for weapons and items to help you neutralize the monster.  You may also have to go to specific rooms to perform tasks, like restarting the failing generator, pumping up the life support system, or overriding the safety systems on the airlock.  Each player gets one action per turn and an allotment of movement points.  The monster also gets at least one action and move every turn.&#10;&#10;Space Monster uses a modular, card-based board, special powers for each player, a deck of special powers for the monster, and an unusual deck-based hit point system for the monster.  When the monster takes damage, it loses cards from its health deck.  When all damage is dealt, the instructions on the card on top the the discarded health cards tells you how the monster reacts.  If you draw the special Dying Gasp card, you know the monster is almost dead.&#10;&#10;Space Monster is a fairly complex game. As such, it is appropriate for ages 14 and up. A 4-player game takes about 60+ minutes to play, although your first game may take significantly longer.&#10;&#10;The rules, cards, and tokens you need to play are all available as a 240 KB PDF at http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/139/&#10;&#10;"

The pieces consist of the usual 16 with, in addition, 2 new pieces [F] in each of the three armies.  These are called: Red, Chuo (fire); Blue , Ch'i (banner); Green, Feng (wind).  Their move is an extended Kt's leap, viz. two steps vertically or horizontally and then one diagonally.  The game is said to be very complicated and difficult, but is not considered as interesting as the ordinary chess.  When one of the Generals, who are named Wei, Shu, and Wu after the names of the three kingdoms, is mated, the player who has mated him removes the King from the board and adds the remainder of his army to his own.&#10;&#10;The diagram he mentions can be found in the images section of this games entry page.&#10;&#10;"

They operated out of a swank office at the Hawaiian Village Hotel, where they were also the house detectives. Assisting them occasionally was a funny, ukelele-strumming Hawaiian taxi driver named Kazuo Kim (Poncie Ponce), whose wardrobe - consisting of a straw hat and crazy Hawaiian shirts - and numerous relatives living all over the Hawaiian Islands willing to help his employers if they needed it, provided invaluable comic relief. They were also aided by a dim-bulbed, scatter-brained, flippant nightclub singer and photographer named Chryseis &quot;Cricket&quot; Blake (Connie Stevens).&#10;&#10;"
