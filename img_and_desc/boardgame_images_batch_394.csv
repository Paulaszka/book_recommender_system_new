Each physical location has five temporal locations: the far future, near future, present, recent past, and distant past.  There are two more temporal locations: the unknown future and the permanent past.  Each turn is divided into phases.  Early in the turn, the players get to move and alter the state of the board.  Later in the turn, time moves from the future toward the past.  This means that anything in a:&#10;&#10;     distant past version of a physical location moves into the permanent past and off the board&#10;     recent past version of a physical location moves into the distant past version of the same location&#10;     present version of a physical location ***copies itself*** into the recent past version of the same location&#10;     near future version of a physical location moves into the present version of the same location&#10;     far future version of a physical location moves into the near future version of the same location&#10;&#10;&#10;The layout of the board, combined with the mechanics for the progression of time are the critical elements for representing time travel in the game.&#10;&#10;"

After the movement, the player has either reached a special field of the board or gets to draw a random encounter card. This may be an item to pick up or an enemy that must be overcome. At the special fields, keys may be collected or allied spirits recruited.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved with a special die, which is rolled alternately by the player and by the enemy. Depending on the roll of this die, the rolling party may regain health, inflict damage or invoke special powers. These powers allow to deal more damage, regain health, collect treasure after victory etc. Each player and each enemy has three such powers, and the die roll determines which is used.&#10;&#10;During the game, players collect rewards like gems and tokens that increase their fighting power. They may also increase their power by recruiting an allied spirit.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to collect four keys and open the treasure vault. To collect a key, a coin must be tossed when a key field of the board is reached. The coin is made of cardboard and shows either YES or NO. If the NO side comes up, the action fails and no key is found. The same mechanic is used to check if the treasure vault can be opened once it is reached with four keys - if this fails, four new keys must be collected to retry.&#10;&#10;To hinder the success of the other players, mines can be used. These represent small traps of different type. If a player walks across such a mine - represented by a small cardboard chit - the mine may e.g. destroy equipment.&#10;&#10;Rules are in English, German and Russian.&#10;&#10;"

Each turn, you draw two cards from a common draw pile, and use these cards to form and assist your gang members. If you draw a gang member, you can add him to your gang (but have to pay him money each turn). If you draw a special ability (like drug king) or a racket (selling stolen cars, owning an illegal gaming club) you can attach it to any of your gang members. You can also happen to draw crack cards (alcoholic, drug addict, rat) that you have to attach to any of your members.&#10;&#10;&quot;Smugglings&quot; and &quot;heists&quot; usually require more gang members than you have in your gang. Team up with another gang, decide on how to split the loot, roll the die to determine success. If the hit/smuggling failed, all participants must roll the die to see if they were caught (in which case the gang members are lost). If it succeeds, all gangs involved secretly choose the card &quot;deal&quot; or &quot;you're fucked&quot; and show it to the others simultaneously. If all shows &quot;deal&quot;, the loot is split according to the deal. If one of the gangs shows &quot;you're fucked&quot; he takes the lot. If two or more shows &quot;you're fucked&quot;, there is a shootout, the police arrives, and no one gets anything.&#10;&#10;There is also the option to use your gang members to kill off your opponents cronies in order to take command of their rackets or to steal their money.&#10;&#10;The game is language level 2 or 3 borderline case.&#10;&#10;"
