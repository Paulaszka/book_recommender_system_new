Once you have completed the challenge you move on to the next round and start playing for a new reward card. To make things interesting the rewards will become more and more naughty until the game ends with the final reward - which of course is the naughtiest of them all.&#10;&#10;

Sitting Ducks is reminiscent of the classic carnival-style, midway shooting galleries, where players are trying to take out as many ducks as possible.

The goal is to be the last duck in the pond!&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;In Sitting Ducks, each player gets their own group of ducks. Those ducks are shuffled together and form the Duck Deck, which then become the Duck line.&#10;&#10;The Duck line is always in flux - when a Duck is removed; the other ducks move forward to fill the gap.  Certain cards can move the line forward, backwards or rearrange ducks in the line in your favor or your opponents. With the right cards, players may also move and manipulate targets to try to keep their own Ducks safe.&#10;&#10;Eventually, you&rsquo;ll get caught snoozing and you will surely lose some of your ducks.&#10;&#10;Lose all of your ducks, and you can no longer win the game.  But, one of the most fun aspects of Sitting Ducks is when all of your ducks have been eliminated from the game. Although you won&rsquo;t win, you&rsquo;ll still get a chance to exact revenge on the opponents who took you out and play Action Cards for the rest of the game! The last player to have a duck in the water is the winner!&#10;&#10;"

Players then take it in turns to spin.  If a colour matching a spot on their board comes up, they take a sheep stand-up wearing that colour and place it on the appropriate spot on their board.&#10;&#10;The player who fills their board with six sheep first is the winner.&#10;&#10;There is a wildcard spot on the spinner, allowing players to choose the colour themselves.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box:&#10;&quot;Can you be the first to collect all of your sheep?&#10;Gather your flock in this fun colour matching game for young players!&quot;&#10;&#10;"

As you travel though a deck of adventure cards rife with dangers, you battle zombie hordes, drive abandoned school buses, scavenge for gas and bullets, and explore a darkened, tainted American countryside full of shambling undead, haunted carnivals, and plumes of toxic gas. Your goal is to stay alive until you reach the safe, sandy beaches of the California coast.&#10;&#10;Three different stages of adventure cards create an experience of increasing difficulty and ensure that each playthrough is unique. Each round begins with an auction that determines both player order and which cards you will encounter. Since the resources used for bidding are the same as those used to battle the oncoming zombie hordes, your survival depends as much on your resource management as it does upon winning those bidding wars. The player who either accumulates the most points or survives the longest wins.&#10;&#10;Zombies of all types await, with cannibals, anti-personnel mines and radioactive wastes also being among the hazards awaiting the players. Who will survive the zombie onslaught?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
