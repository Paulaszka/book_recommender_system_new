With a and k, you could write: bank, sand, castle, keep, sake, for, age, less, time.  All of these can go together to form words or phrases or idea-connections with the previous word (for and age makes &quot;forage&quot;).  When time is up, you have to pass to the right and carry on from the last word which the previous player wrote.  After each sheet of paper has been around every player, each player scores for the words they wrote.  Any disputed connections are voted on.&#10;&#10;"

The difference is that instead of a ball the game uses a battery operated plastic car (driven by Benny) which moves around the playing field all by itself. So players must use their flippers to try and shoot Benny across the board and have him drive (or slide) into the opponent's goal. The first player to score 5 goals wins.&#10;&#10;

13620,,"This is a game for children who like to play doctor. The vertical board features a picture of Charlie who &quot;has the Icky Wickys and needs you to help him feel better!&quot; On your turn, you select what sort of check-up you'd like to perform: Ear Scope Check-Up, Thermometer Check-Up, X-Ray Check-Up, or the Ankle Cast Check-up (which must be done last). Each check-up has an instrument to use which also reveals a hidden picture. For example, the Thermometer tip is inserted into Charlie's mouth and pressed until the window pops open, or a slide is inserted into the X-Ray machine and a light is switched on to reveal the picture. If the picture of a happy Charlie face appears, you are successful and you take a puzzle piece depicting the check-up and place it in a frame. If an Icky Wicky is the picture, your turn ends and you must perform the check-up again later. The first player to perform all 4 check-ups successfully (and thus complete the puzzle) is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

13629,,"Originally published in 1923, this is one of six &quot;S&amp;E Games&quot; titles by Stoll &amp; Edwards. It is a simple spin-and-move race through the episodes of Charles Perrault's authored version of Cinderella (1697): Cinderella having to watch her stepsisters go to the ball, her fairy Godmother appearing, the three nights of the ball, and so on. The board is laid out in a spiral with many spaces including elements of the story, but only some of them instructing players to advance or move back a few spaces or lose turns. One space asks players to draw a random &quot;magic leaf&quot; and do what it says. The board is 16&quot; square and printed in just three colors (black, red, and blue).&#10;&#10;Under the original &quot;Game of Cinderella&quot; title, it was reprinted along with its five sibling games in 1928, as part of Stoll &amp; Edwards' &quot;Two-Games-in-One&quot; series. These featured a two-sided board with the race game on one side and a checkerboard (for chess or checkers) on the other. Implements and rules were included for one game along with &quot;a full set of checker men&quot; (as a Stoll &amp; Edwards catalog put it) for the other.&#10;&#10;A decade later, in their next incarnation as Stoll &amp; Einson, the publisher reissued the game as &quot;Cinderella&quot; under their Playjoy brand. The single-sided board of this edition was slightly bigger than the original, with redrawn art utilizing a wider variety of colors.&#10;&#10;In each edition, the game included a cardboard &quot;indicator&quot; (spinner) and 12 red magic leaf cards (which look a lot like hearts). The 1923 edition included colored wooden discs as player tokens, while the 1928 and 1934 editions used turned wooden pawns.&#10;&#10;"

It is essentially a boardgame, as the game comes with counters and mapboard, but also is designed to be played with miniatures.

The ruleset, while still fairly simple, if compared to miniature rules sets, models all the historically important variables such as troop quality, fatigue, surprise, ability of generals, weather, etc.&#10;&#10;The game also contains a &quot;simple&quot; version of the rules + scenario that is well suited to introductory wargames (it was in fact used as the Society's &quot;Participation&quot; game at shows) as well as a &quot;mix-and-match&quot; tournament style system whereby the different armies are randomly matched against each other. This essentially provides a huge amount of random scenarios to supplement the 36 &quot;canned&quot; scenarios on which the rules are based.&#10;&#10;"
