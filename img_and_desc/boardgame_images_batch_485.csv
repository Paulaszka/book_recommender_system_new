The block of ice opens a hole in the right side of the hull and after two hours and forty minutes the Titanic is doomed.&#10;&#10;One hundred years after those happenings, Sir Chester Cobblepot offers a refined board game that celebrates the unforgettable heroism and determination of the passengers on that English transatlantic. More specifically, our main characters are the survivors of the last lifeboat lowered into the water, the collapsible D.&#10;&#10;The idea for Collapsible D: The Final Minutes of the Titanic comes from the mind of the Italian author Gianluca Santopietro. In this game the players are on board the Titanic during the night of April 14, 1912, starting at 11:40 p.m. when the ship collides with an iceberg; each turn represents ten minutes in real time. Each player controls a passenger of each Class and a member of the Crew. Each character has a different starting point, an attempt to recreate the exact location where they were on the ship, thanks to historical research led by the author in cooperation with history experts on the Titanic, such as Claudio Bossi. Thanks to an intuitive movement system, players will move their passengers through the ship, trying to reach the lifeboats on the dock.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, the water floods in quickly and the risk of drowning is very high. Each saved passenger grants victory points, and the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

It is as close and yet far from Chinese Mahjong as Sh&ocirc;gi (Japanese Chess) can be the same and yet different from original Chess. Mahjong was brought to Japan in 1904, but the Riichi form that is used in modern times probably originated from the 1920s. Today, the worldwide famous Mahjong Association officially recognized the complete rules of Riichi Mahjong for Tournaments.&#10;&#10;The main differences are :&#10;1) The 1-Yaku minimum: In order to win a hand, it can only be validated when your hand has at least one of the Yaku (specific hand combinations) in it.&#10;2) Dora: A specific bonus tiles are indicated by the flipped tile from the dead wall and providing other possible Han bonus.&#10;3) Riichi: When a player is Tenpai (one tile away from having a Mahjong hand, valid or not), he can bet a 1000 points chip to add one Yaku to his hand (thus validating a possible invalid hand).  Winning with a Riichi hand allows access to the hidden ura-dora, which is an added dora indicator located underneath the revealed dora tile.&#10;4) Abortive draws: Specific conditions, which ends a hand without winning prior to the drawing of all tiles, aside from the dead wall.&#10;5) Scoring system: Much more complex than in Chinese Mahjong, it is based on hand combinations (Yaku) providing multipliers (Han) that combine with some other circumstantial points like the type of tiles in the hand (Fu) for any 4 han or less.  The combination of Han and Fu correspond to a chart (and even an equation) to finally produce the hand's scoring points (Ten).&#10;&#10;Some other minor elements in the Riichi Mahjong differ from the original Mahjong but are not important enough to be fully mentioned, like the Red 5 tiles (a non-official variant sometimes used which gives bonus like the Dora) or the validation of some Yaku (when the hand must be kept hidden or not, depending on the Japanese region where the game is played).&#10;&#10;"

In this game you will play the role of a publisher in the city of Bibliogamo. Using cards to hire artisans, you will put them to work in six city tower workshops, each devoted to a different kind of book. The Chief Librarian of the City will, in turn, tour the city buying books at what he considers their proper value. Prestige Collection cards generate victory points depending on how well you can fulfill the requirements of the Chief Librarian&rsquo;s collection.&#10;&#10;Needed to play: the game board showing the city of Bibliogamo, the 47 Artisan cards, the 7 Prestige Collection cards, 26 black eurocubes representing your Artisans, and 16 red eurocubes to act as track markers in the game. Additionally you&rsquo;ll need one pawn to represent the Librarian.&#10;&#10;Win: The game is over when the Time Track eurocube reaches [40] and you complete your turn.

Your total VP is your score for the game.&#10;&#10;The Five Turn Phases:&#10;1. Move the time track eurocube forward one day closer to [40].&#10;&#10;2. Move the Librarian Pawn clockwise 3 spaces, then turn over the top Artisan card from the draw pile on to the discard pile and move the Librarian accordingly as indicated by the Librarian icon on the left-hand side of the card.&#10;&#10;3. Look at the small Artisan icon below the Librarian icon on this same card. You may not play any card with that Artisan symbol on it this turn unless you discard a card from your hand with a matching small Artisan icon.&#10;&#10;4. You may now do any of the following, but in order:&#10;a. Pay 1 Florin to move the Librarian forward or backward one space. You may pay 1 Florin for each space you wish to move the Librarian.&#10;b. Sell a book, if completed, in the Tower the Librarian is currently standing on. Turn over the next 2 Artisan cards from the draw deck. Place the second card to the right of the first and look at the florin value on the second card as indicated by the Florin icon at on the first card. This is the amount the Librarian is willing to pay for this book. You may pay extra 1 day of time to turn over another card replacing the current Florin amount. You may continue to do this, paying 1 day of time per card turned over, until you are satisfied with the price.     &#10;Mark this amount on your Florin Track and return all Artisan eurocubes from the completed book to your pool. Then mark the production of a book on your Book track, moving the red eurocube forward one space, and if the book is one of those needed for a Prestige Collection, mark that book on the Prestige Collection card as well with a red eurocube. Note: you may pay extra days of time only if they remain on the Time Track. Lastly, place all drawn cards used to calculate the Florin value on the discard pile.&#10;c. Discard one Artisan card from your hand to the discard pile and place that number of black eurocubes on the Artisans indicated by the card, on any one Tower. Then discard one more card from your hand to pay for those Artisans. You may do this action twice if you wish. You do not receive any surplus Artisans from the discarded card. Nor do you receive any surplus Artisans if your tower already has the number required for that Artisan type. The second time you do this action you may add Artisans to the same tower or a different one.&#10;&#10;5. Draw back to a hand of 5 cards.

One item &ndash; a coat hanger, a vase, a dollhouse couch &ndash; is placed on most of the spaces in the array, while a few spaces are covered with vouchers. Three items are set aside at random, and those are the goods that Aunt Trudel will weigh at checkout to see whether you'd met her tough standards.&#10;&#10;All players start on the same corner of the game board with a shopping basket. On a turn, a player rolls a die, moves her basket that many spaces around the game board in a clockwise direction, then picks up one item (or voucher) from the row that her basket is next to and places it in her basket. If a player's basket lands on the same location as an opponent's basket, then the player can take an item from the opponent instead. If a player picks up a voucher, she can exchange it later for another item on the board, putting the voucher in its place, in addition to taking an item. The first player to circle the board has the option of then moving counter-clockwise to pick up more goods; everyone else is finished once they circle the game board.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then weighs her goods against Aunt Trudel's holdings using the funky cardboard scale included in the box.

From its military origin comes the peculiar quadrilateral structure divided by the main streets. Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port. Important monuments such as the Gladiator Arena, the horse-racing Stadium, and the famous theater were built, as well as craftsmen's workshops, patrician villas which completed the architectural network of the city.&#10;&#10;In Aquileia, players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).&#10;&#10;Each round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track. Placing the tiebreaker is mandatory; placing henchmen is not (but you probably want to place them). Once everyone has passed or placed all of their tokens, players resolve the action spaces in numerical order:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Mercatus allows players to buy weapons, arms and slave cards, collect money through a die roll, claim four blue dice for use with the Arena and Stadium, and trade one currency for another. (This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)&#10;    At the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.&#10;    The Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.&#10;    The Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies. &#10;    In the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.&#10;    Finally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.&#10;&#10;&#10;After six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color. (For example, a total of 8 points of blue villas and three blue villa cards equals 24 points.) The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;"

But someone is taking the concept to the next terrifying level.&#10;&#10;Abandoned and forgotten for over two decades, Camp Hackaway sits in the middle of a thick forest where foliage and undergrowth have nearly reclaimed the old campground. People from all over the world are being abducted and dropped off in the forest on the outskirts of Camp Hackaway, forced to become unwilling participants in the ultimate game of escape and survival. Each participant is given a flashlight three very simple rules: 1) Search the cabins of the campground, find the key to the old pickup truck. 2) Survive the random attacks crazed serial killer Hackin' Hank. 3) Escape in the old pickup truck and win the game. And it won't be as easy as Hackin' Hank constantly roams the campground, stalking the participants one by one.&#10;&#10;Body Count is a horror themed card/board game hybrid that utilizes tile-flipping mechanic to simulate the fog of war as the players roam the campground in the dead of night, unsure of their surroundings. The game board is made up of a 4x4 grid of 3.5 inch square tiles that begin face-down. As players move along the grid, they flip tiles to reveal their destination before moving to the next tile. If they discover a cabin, they may search it and possibly find items to help them fend of Hank if he attacks, but they may also find other, more horrifying objects such as severed heads and human remains that may trigger other events that can change the game and affect their chances of escaping alive.&#10;&#10;After each player's turn, a card is drawn from Hank's location deck to see where he pops up in the campground - if it's a location occupied by a player, Hank attacks. If a player enters a tile adjacent to a tile occupied by Hank, he gets the opportunity to stalk and attack them.&#10;&#10;The game board changes with every game so you'll never play the same game twice.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to SEARCH, SURVIVE, and ESCAPE?&#10;&#10;"

One was to reflect the slower rate of fire for matchlock weapons. That was easy enough.&#10;&#10;The second was to bring in the flair and 'swashbuckling' aspects of the period into the rules. It is often forgotten that schools of martial arts were as thorough and widespread in Europe as they were in Japan in the 1500's through the 1600's. There were all kinds of flashy moves and clever tricks.&#10;&#10;So the rules weave in this kind of option to do more than simply move-attack-resolve-repeat. More than just strict combat options, the Swashbuckling rules allow you to be more interactive with your terrain. It opens up more of the game to narrative, or story-telling wargaming.

A routing unit must test morale again in the next turn and is removed from the game if it fails that second test.&#10;&#10;The rules also include a few special rules for flank attacks, cover, fortifications and siege engines.&#10;&#10;The rules come with a scenario (The Battle of Grey Rock) for which colour counters are included in the magazine.&#10;&#10;"

But then, there are the elementals who can't be conquered with pure strength...&#10;&#10;The player who can place all his possession tokens wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game was released as a PnP game on October 26th 2011, the author's 38th birthday.&#10;&#10;This game came in the final round (i.e. Top 12) of the Hippodice contest 2012.&#10;&#10;"

Within a set period of a time, they must generate, trade, and gather as much wealth as possible with the holder of the most wealth being the controller of industry for this colony.  This won't be a trivial task.  The world experiences strange weather, pirates and gangs loot, and other players get revenge for your own actions against them (or just simply doing better than they are).  Technology isn't exactly your friend as the cranky and failure prone (Reconfigurable Industrial Gathering Systems) RIGS will produce but with the risk of spontaneously blowing up.  Unfortunately, they are the key tools for industry... and the only one available.&#10;&#10;Players are grant plots of land, survey the land for Luxuries (the only thing the rest of the universe wants), place RIGS on plots, and hope for the best as Disaster and other players strike.  Weather the disasters that affect your production, resources, and RIGS.  Manage to produce not only Luxuries, but other needed Energy, Metal, Supply resources to keep your operation running and growing.  Then, sell the Luxuries on the ever-changing market.  Make deals with other players for simple trades or pacts against other players.  In the end, final value of all resources a player has (except RIGS... no one wants those troublesome things) is determined.  The player with the greatest wealth wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;ContentsContent Checklist&#10;Rule Book&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DecksPlot Deck:     27 cards&#10;Survey Deck:   27 cards&#10;Karma Deck:    36 cards&#10;Market Deck:   32 cards&#10;Disaster Deck: 18 cards&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;TokensEnergy Tokens x 50&#10;Metal Tokens  x 50&#10;Supply Tokens x 50&#10;Luxury Tokens x 50&#10;RIGS Tokens   x 75&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Money1 Credit Bill   x 40&#10;5 Credit Bill   x 40&#10;10 Credit Bill  x 40&#10;20 Credit Bill  x 40&#10;50 Credit Bill  x 20&#10;100 Credit Bill x 20&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Vinnie (Loan) ScriptEnergy Vinnie Script x 20&#10;Supply Vinnie Script x 20&#10;Metal Vinnie Script  x 20&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherSix-sided die&#10;&#10;"

It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.&#10;&#10;The game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.&#10;&#10;Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811&#10;The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811&#10;On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.&#10;&#10;El Bodon 25th September 1811&#10;The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:&#10;&#10;    A 59 x 40 cm map,&#10;    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,&#10;    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.&#10;&#10;&#10;Units : Regiments and brigades&#10;Map scale : 500 m/hex.&#10;Turn : 120 minutes&#10;&#10;Complexity : 6 / 9&#10;&#10;Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).&#10;&#10;"
