Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis vie for control of the nation&rsquo;s destiny, with both understanding that the struggle is as much political as it is a process of arms.  Victory in battle will provide the most persuasive political argument when it comes to the five slave states bordering those already in contention &ndash; Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia.  These are the states both the Confederacy and the Union need to win over.  In each case, how these scales will tip, favoring either abolition or those who endorse the doctrine of human &ldquo;property,&rdquo; is yet to be decided.

Pieces come in yellow, cyan, and magenta, and initially you must play these pieces on the lowest level of the game board.

Orange Swan may be combined with Black Swan and Orange Swan: Dai T&#197;&#141;-A Sens&#197;&#141; or both!&#10;&#10;The Call of The Orange Swan&#10;&#10;Japan, on the eve of its entry into World War Two, is looking in two different directions. It sees opportunity and it fears defeat. It clamours for modernity and yet it will not, cannot, forsake a history of staid traditions and the rituals of self-slaughter.&#10;&#10;Admiral Yamamoto, at the head of a powerful navy, is being driven towards a decision that is not of his making. Those who truly desire war will relinquish neither their swords nor the ethos with which they are imbued, and so even while the likes of Hideki Tojo make their case for the fulfilment of destiny, for the acquisition of empire and the control of an abundance of natural resources, Yamamoto is painfully aware that their contempt for any and all likely enemies, their belief in the cult of the warrior, their very dreams of battle and conquest, belong to an age that is already dead.&#10;&#10;Yamamoto sees only one chance &ndash; Japan must strike quickly and with overwhelming and decisive force. If the enemy, first and foremost the United States, is given any pause, any form of reprieve, Japan will almost certainly be crushed.&#10;&#10;Chance and mischance play out their themes at Pearl Harbor. Japan wins and loses all in the same instant. The US carriers are not there, and while Japan will conquer for a while, bringing much of the Pacific and SE Asia under its control, it cannot hold what it has gained. The oft-repeated commands to fight to the death are each an admission that they have already lost. It is only a matter of time&hellip;and of blood.&#10;&#10;The culmination is at Hiroshima. What good swords at such a time, against such a vast and blinding and terrible fire? Those who hungered for war have no answer. They have never had an answer. Science and industry do not sit well with emperor worship or with archaic notions of sacrifice.&#10;&#10;Could it have been different? Chance and mischance are the ultimate reality of every course that every war has ever followed. Orange Swan is your means to experience this.&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a block wargame covering WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945.&#10;&#10;As in all other block games, both the Fog of War and Unit strength reduction/increase by rotation, drive the gameplay in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy block until it is revealed in combat.&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a historical game with some fixed starting points, but the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (China, Commonwealth and US).&#10;&#10;During any Victory Check (two per each Season, one at the end of the Axis Turn and one at the end of the Allied Turn), the game immediately ends with a Total Victory if either the following conditions are met:&#10;&#10;a.    Tokyo is enemy Controlled;&#10;b.    Atomic Bomb Event;&#10;c.    Japan controls 7 Strategic Land Areas or Japan has a Production of 75.&#10;&#10;Additionally, a special Victory Check is made at the end of the each year of the Campaign game, or at the end of a Scenario.&#10;&#10;Game Introduction&#10;&#10;ORANGE SWAN is a historical game that covers WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945. Its name reflects that of its older sibling Black Swan, a game that covers WWII&rsquo;s European Theatre, but also that of the United States&rsquo; plan for fighting Japan, developed long before Pearl Harbor, called War Plan Orange.&#10;&#10;Orange Swan uses many of the same game mechanics as Black Swan but with greater focus on the innovative, and mechanically simple, naval systems that were universally praised.&#10;&#10;One revision that entirely changes the feel of the game is the addition of the Seaborne Blitz phase. Similar to Black Swan&rsquo;s land based Blitz double turns that made the Eastern Front so dynamic, Orange Swan translates that idea to a double naval turn. The results are highly satisfying from both a gameplay and historical perspective.&#10;&#10;Similar to other block games, Fog of War is a core element in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy unit until it is revealed in combat.&#10;&#10;While Orange Swan&rsquo;s campaigns and scenarios feature historical starting points, the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (the United States, the Commonwealth, and China).&#10;&#10;The Allied Side can cooperate, so they can stack together, or trace supply accross either a Sea Zone or a Land Area Controlled by an Allied Nation. (Note: Chinese Communists stack only with themselves).&#10;&#10;Japan, the United States (US), the Commonwealth (CW), and China are Major Nations. The Philippines and Dutch East Indies (DEI) are Minor Nations controlled by the US and CW respectively.&#10;&#10;No Side can enter Land Areas belonging to the Soviet Union or any of the Absolute Neutrals, identified with a white border: Nepal and Butan.&#10;&#10;Each Major Nation has its own units (in a specific color), Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.&#10;&#10;The Force Pool of a Nation is made up of all units of that Nation that are not deployed on the mapboard and are available to be built (that is, purchased during the Production Phase).  Note that some units have a colored circled number (2, 3, or 4) in one corner, indicating the year when the unit is added to the respective Force Pool. Thus, in 1943 it is not possible to build a Unit marked with a circled &ldquo;4&quot;, as it will be added to the proper Nation's Force Pool in Winter 1944. Elite Units are designated with a darker color background.&#10;&#10;Nations of the same Side maintain their own Supply Source (their National Capital) but they can trace Supply using any of their Side&rsquo;s Naval Units, Controlled Land Areas, or Controlled Sea Zones. They can freely enter any Land Area of, and be transported by, the Naval Units of their Side. They can stack, move, and attack together, but each Nation keeps its own Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.&#10;&#10;China has two kinds of forces: Nationalists and Communists. Both Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists are always supplied and therefore do not need to trace any supply.&#10;&#10;Chinese Communist Units can only stack with other Chinese Communists. They can, obviously, attack any Axis Side Units. Chinese Nationalists can stack (and move/attack) freely with units of the Allied Side.&#10;&#10;All Chinese units are restricted to Continental Asia and Hainan and can never be Sea Transported.&#10;&#10;National Capitals: Nations have the following Capitals, which also act as Supply Sources:&#10;&#10;1.       Japan: Tokyo&#10;2.       US: San Diego&#10;3.       CW: New Delhi and Sidney&#10;4.       Philippines: Manila&#10;5.       Dutch East Indies: Batavia&#10;&#10;Nation&rsquo;s have their own blocks of the following color:&#10;&#10;1.       Japan: orange&#10;2.       US: green&#10;3.       CW: blue&#10;4.       China: purple&#10;5.       Philippines: light green&#10;6.       Dutch East Indies (DEI): light blue&#10;&#10;Minor Nations do not have their own Economic or Strategic Power, nor a dedicated Force Pool. They are controlled by the Major Power they are allied to, which treats them as if they were CW (for the DEI) or US (for the Philippines) units for all game effects. When destroyed, Minor Nations units are eliminated from the game, so they will never go into any Force Pool.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The active player chooses an area and says a word and a number, with the number telling how many times the letter in that area appears in the word. The other players then hit the area with their fingers (&quot;destroy it with their meteor&quot;) while shouting the answer. A correct answer yields a point, then it's the next player's turn. First player to reach 5 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The gift of petty conflict!&#10;&#10;In Bequest, players will strategically split Dr. Schism&rsquo;s fortune with their villainous neighbors! Each player draws five Asset cards, and splits them into two piles for the player on your right, who will choose one to keep, leaving you the other, while you do the same with the piles split by the player on your left. Once everyone has chosen, you&rsquo;ll collect your spoils, and soon another round will begin, this time going in the other direction!&#10;&#10;With a variety of different Asset types to collect, you&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on your neighbors to figure out what they&rsquo;re looking for, and how badly they need it. You&rsquo;ll collect matching gadgets for exponentially increasing $ values, Hideouts for set $ values, and try to avoid ending up with Evidence, which count as -$3 each once you have three or more. Global Influence earns you $10 or $20 provided you have more than your neighbors, and Schemes provide unique scoring conditions based on the rest of your collection.&#10;&#10;One Asset type is Keys to Dr. Schism&rsquo;s vault, each with a spot in the drafting order for Special Asset cards, which include the Schemes, and powerful versions of the other card types. Will you pick the smaller pile with a Key, and a chance to claim Dr. Schism&rsquo;s $5 Space Station hideout? Or play it safe with a Bunker and two power cores?&#10;&#10;Bequest packs a ton of strategy into what looks like simple decisions. Will you be clever enough to walk away with the lion&rsquo;s share of Dr. Schism&rsquo;s estate, and become the next great supervillain?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
