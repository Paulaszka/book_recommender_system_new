Using the Mayan Haab agricultural calendar invented in roughly 500 BC, players inform their villages when to best plant their seeds so that they may grow a tremendous harvest to feed their people. After their seeds are planted, the astronomers recommend rituals to aid in their harvest and their reading of prophecies in the stars, but problems arise. A village conducting a ritual to help their crop could be stealing the power of the sun or cosmos from a nearby neighbor. Droughts may crush other villages.&#10;&#10;After crops have been harvested, the ancient astronomers now begin to forecast the prophecies of the stars. Using the technologies found in the Aztec Calendar, the important messages from the sky above may be telling us when and how the world will end. Players wager a bet about the ultimate destiny.

It&rsquo;s working with everyone else without wanting to run screaming for the hills.&#10;&#10;Collaborating with smart people on challenging problems is, inevitably, fraught with conflict. Conflict can be good for creative work, moving a project forward as designers wrestle with the challenge. But not all conflict is healthy, and frankly most designers aren&rsquo;t, shall we say, diplomats.&#10;&#10;Surviving Design Projects is, among other things, a little game to help designers hone their people skills. It&rsquo;s pretty easy. Each player takes turns being the Creative Director. He or she turns over a Situation card, and then tells a little story about the situation shown. She can make it up or draw from her own experience.&#10;&#10;Let's say I turn over the situation &quot;Lack of Inputs.&quot; Maybe I make up this story:&#10;&#10;Though the client has provided stacks of user research, they can&rsquo;t offer us any clear business priorities. They&rsquo;re just asking us to make their site better without giving us a sense of what they want to accomplish. I need to go talk to the client about this, and try to get them to give us some inputs.&#10;&#10;Each player around the table chooses a Pattern card from their hand and places it face-up next to the situation card. The Creative Director chooses one player to go first and describe how they would apply the pattern to the situation. That is, to describe the technique would they use to make the conflict productive. Let&rsquo;s say one player uses &ldquo;Make Educated Guesses&rdquo; and describes it this way:&#10;&#10;The Make Educated Guesses pattern suggests we fill in the holes ourselves with some assumptions. I guess the idea is that we&rsquo;re smart people, so we should know what the starting point is. We could brainstorm a list of assumptions about the project&rsquo;s business priorities, then share that with the client to validate it.&#10;&#10;The Creative Director then chooses which technique she would use to deal with the situation and leads a group discussion about the choice. The person who suggested the pattern receives the situation card. The player to the Creative Director&rsquo;s left becomes the next creative director, flipping the top Situation card, and starting again. At the end of the game, the person who has the most Situation cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;So that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple game, but the idea is to get people talking about difficult situations in a no-strings environment.&#10;&#10;"

After each play, you record the information on the yardage/down marker. Like football, the offensive player must make 10 yards in 4 downs to continue or the the board is turned around to switch positions.

To do this a player must try to communicate with the other players telepathically.

Five such attempts (i.e. guesses) are allowed and the fewer used mean that you move further along the board in your journey to the centre.&#10;&#10;

Each side will battle for 28 souls, which are worth victory points. Players add holy or unholy points on the souls in play based on how they use temptation, virtue, sin, intercession, holy relic, unholy relic, angel and devil cards. Earn enough holy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to heaven, earning the side of good victory points; earn enough unholy points, and when the soul is reaped it goes to hell, earning the side of evil victory points. If a soul does not earn enough holy or unholy points and is reaped, it goes to purgatory where its victory points are not counted.&#10;&#10;Guiding a soul to complete purity or complete darkness before death and final judgment adds a new archangel or prince of hell to a player's arsenal.

Strategies include focusing on gaining more help from heaven or hell to increase your power, working to reap souls quickly from the start with little intervention from the angelic and demonic hordes, or balancing your play to ensure victory.&#10;&#10;Sin, Intercession, and Relic cards can be purchased for beneficial effects at the cost of holy and unholy points.

Each player has 16 cards (cowboys) with a specific strenght (0 to 5) and special habilities. Each card is played to influence the meeples (fugitives) that borders it.

Besides surrounding areas containing fugitives, players must also make the better use of their card habilities to obtain the best rewards. This happens because the prices are variable. The player who uses best the &quot;prices market&quot; will take an important advantage, because it's preferable to capture less if the price is higher. Cards may be played face up and face down.
