Players are part of a covert team (red, blue, green) that must eliminate one member of an opposing team, but your target is a mystery. At the start of the round, players are randomly dealt a card that depicts one of four characters: sniper, agent, cleaner, mole. The sniper of one team must shoot the sniper of another team to win that round. Problem is, you have to figure out who to shoot without being shot yourself.&#10;&#10;As for the other characters, the mole is secretly working for one of the other teams, the agent makes the other team lose if he is shot, and the cleaner must make the shot if the sniper isn&rsquo;t a part of the team. (Two cards are randomly thrown out each round, so a team&rsquo;s sniper might be out of play. The cleaner needs to figure this out by talking with his teammates, but since all discussion is open, they still need to be covert in their talk.) Members of the winning team (or teams, when three teams are in play) receive a score card, and the first player (or players) to receive four cards wins the game. Teams are randomly determined each round, so your back-up man one round may be your target the next. Covert Action sounds utterly simple, yet is difficult to describe succinctly. I look forward to seeing how Frank makes everything clear in the rules.&#10;&#10;"

The dimensions are 250mm (10&quot;) by 355mm (14&quot;).  There are fifteen separate boards, including a Chess / Checkers board in the front papers and a Backgammon board in the end papers&#10;&#10;John Astrop has written a short introduction, outlining the games he has chosen for this book and categorizing them in four groups:&#10;Easy Race Games (for small kids)- Ludo, Fire! Fire! (Snakes and Ladders), Steeplechase and Dragon.&#10;Harder Race Games (for older games) - Palm Tree, Shunting, Jackpot and Space Race.&#10;Position Games (dependent on strategy alone)- Checkers, Chess, Nine Men's morris, Five Field Kono, Asalto &#10;Wargames (strategy, imagination and luck) - Chess, Spychase, Warlord and Backgammon.&#10;&#10;Palm Tree is a combination of Ludo and Snakes and Ladders, with a nice art deco board.&#10;&#10;Space Race, Shunting, Warlord, Spychase and Jackpot appear to be original games.  The others are either classic games or re-themed roll-and-move games.&#10;&#10;Space Race is a bigger scale version of Ludo, requiring the players to roll the right numbers to build their rockets before starting on the trip to the Green Planet.  There are various squares on the way that give different results as you land on them.  The only strategy comes in deciding which piece to move.&#10;&#10;In Shunting players again roll and move, but have to pick up four trucks before returning to the start.  Players have only one train each, and can only move in one direction in a turn, but can then change direction on the next direction, as if they were trains passing through points.  Trains block each other, although they do not get bigger with extra trucks on.&#10;&#10;Warlord is a capture game with a pre-Raphaelite design.  Players have 4 pieces starting at castles on the corners on the board, and can move any one of these 4 in turn.  Landing exactly on an enemy piece captures it, and the captured piece can then be moved back to the castle and imprisoned.  Players can release captive pieces through the enchanted forest or lake.  A single piece can capture more than one enemy piece, but if that pile is recaptured, all friendly pieces go free.&#10;&#10;Spychase is similar to Scotland Yard, with no hidden movement.  The spy player attempts to steal a set of plans by rolling and landing on them, then escaping to the airport or docks.  The police players cannot capture the spy until he has taken the plans.  At that point the police player then tries to block in the spy player so that he cannot move his full roll.&#10;&#10;In Jackpot, the 2 players move their pieces up a fruit machine the full number rolled, but can only move a piece when the fruit under the piece moved is shown on the row of 6 fruit that the piece arrives on.  If no forward moves can be made, a piece must be moved down the dice roll instead.  Once all three pieces are at the final squares, a player wins.&#10;&#10;"

You can attempt to sneak up on opponents, ride over them with horses and even let innocent civilians join in the fun. The rules actually contain two games in one. The first set is for fairly evenly matched sides of swordsmen intermingled with one or two pistoleers or musketeers to surprise the unwary as they come round corners.

They then select a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If they can do this, they then roll the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if they cannot conquer a line, they remove one die from play, the rolls again. Their turn ends when either they conquer every line on the card (in which case they claims it) or they no longer have dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional line to do so.

Players took the role of Captain American and Bucky trying to be the first to reach the secret hideout and thwart the evil plans of the Sky Spider! (Who was he???)&#10;&#10;The game is simple spin and move. The only additional  point in the mechanics of the game is that players could land on locations with friends of Cap's (Thor, Spider-Man, Marvel Girl, Wasp, Giant-Man and Iron Man) and get 'help' - (extra spaces). But if you landed on a villain's space, you lost spaces, or full turns.&#10;&#10;The villains included some of the lesser characters of Marvel Comics of the day - and ironically, only one is a Captain America villain!&#10;&#10;Characters drawn on the board game in full color include: Captain America, Bucky, The Mandarin and the Destroyer.&#10;&#10;The villains are an eclectic lot: The Mandarin, Titanium Man, and The General (from Iron Man's story lines); Loki and the Destroyer (from Thor's pages of Journey into Mystery); Lucifer (who barely made an appearance in X-Men comics - issue 9?); the Molten Man (from Spider-Man); and then the only Captain America foe, Zemo. Of course, by this time in the comics, Zemo had already caused Bucky's death, and had in turn died in a battle with Cap! (It was an early Avenger's storyline.)  But we were kids! What did we care!!!&#10;&#10;This game is redeemed by the great art work on the board and the box. (Looks like the villains on the board might be by Don Heck working from Jack Kirby layouts, though the larger Cap and Bucky item might be vintage 1940's Kirby. The box cover certainly looks like 1960's Kirby. Since this came out at the same time as the first Marvel animated series, which were limited animations of actual comic panels, it is also likely these are art pieces simply lifted from existing art. (The Mandarin's piece is from the cover of one of his earliest appearances). This would explain the Heck artwork, since he was currently doing duty on most of the titles featuring these characters.)&#10;&#10;The game originally came with a comic - one of the few early efforts at cross-over collectibles.&#10;&#10;"
