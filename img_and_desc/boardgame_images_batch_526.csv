When the fires of the revolution died down, a political game began to establish the only proper totalitarian regime. The players take the roles of animal dictators who will stop at nothing to gain absolute power over the global Farm.&#10;&#10;1984: Animal Farm is a negotiation game for 3 to 5 players that's based on the concept of forced cooperation. On one hand, players share some business with their neighbors; on the other hand, they are divided by the will to win. The game favors efficient strategy, slick negotiations, and successful bluffing. At the same time, it forces the players to form temporary alliances with their enemies and keep an eye on their friends. All this makes each round of the game abound in heated talks (both public and secret), pacts, promises, and betrayals. Special abilities drawn before the game, along with the winning conditions, guarantee that no two games will be the same.&#10;&#10;&quot;Remember, fellow revolutionaries: All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others!&quot;&#10;&#10;"

To express your opinion of a subject's qualities (player being evaluated), each analyst (all remaining players) must dial their &quot;opinionators&quot; to display a most/least or yes/no answer. Characteristics shown on Ego cards require your opinion of what the player is most and least like. When a statement is read from an Alter Ego card, your yes or no opinion is required of what you think the subject will say. There are no intrinsically right or wrong answers, but answering gives everyone a chance to express their opinions.&#10;&#10;Playing The Game: To select the first subject, an Ego card is drawn by each player. The player whose characteristics begin with the letter nearest the beginning of the alphabet becomes the first subject. The subject then collects all Ego cards drawn and places them face up in the Tripper so that each space contains at least one card. All remaining players and the subject then express their opinions of the subject by dialing their opinionators to mach the most/least color combination under the Ego cards in the tripper.&#10;&#10;Example: The three Ego cards displayed read generous, expressive and shy. If a player perceives the subject as being more expressive than shy or generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word most in the color that matches the color under the expressive ego card in the tripper. If the player perceives the subject as being less shy than generous then the player would dial their opinionator to reveal the word least in the color matching the &quot;shy&quot; ego card under the tripper making sure that the Most color already is revealed at the same time. When all players are ready they turn over their opinionators to reveal their opinions.&#10;&#10;How to Score: The subject moves forward one square for each analyst opinion that matches his, plus one of his own. Players whose opinions do not match any other player move back one square. Players cannot move further back than the beginner square. Player whose opinions match one or more players remain where they are and are not penalized even if they do not match the subject's opinion. After scoring the player on the subject's left becomes the next subject and the next session is played.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game: Play continues with a new subject being evaluated after each session is complete.
