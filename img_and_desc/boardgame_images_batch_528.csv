The game starts on May 13th, the third day of Case Yellow. Six panzer divisions have passed through the Ardennes and are now at the Meuse River. The French and British have raced through Belgium to reach the Dyle Line and cover the Gembloux Gap. The stage is set. Can the Germans cross the Meuse in front of strong opposition?

The game starts on May 24th, the day the British decide that the B.E.F. is in real danger of being cut-off from their supply base and the best option is to head for the coast at Dunkirk. However, many of the German panzer divisions are closer to Dunkirk than the British. Can the British reach the coast before the Germans? Can they hold the Dunkirk perimeter for eight days while they evacuate?&#10; The rules for both games highlight armor, air support, and morale.

The purpose of the game is to kill enemy leader.&#10;&#10;The game is based on a fantasy world of Ithilion, which arose in author&rsquo;s and his coworkers&rsquo; minds.

We do recommend at least four dice per player. During a player's turn, the dice are rolled, the zombies chasing them, and depending on the result, the zombies are either killed, continue to pursue, or are passed to other players or into the Quarantine Zone. The first player to start their turn with no dice to roll escapes and is declared the winner. A four player game typically lasts 5 to 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;"
