Ho Chi Minh had requested cease-fire negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and the French government was looking for a way out that would give them peace with honor. Both sides felt that a &quot;big win&quot; on the battlefield would finally secure at the peace table what they had been unable to obtain in six and a half years of war.&#10;&#10;The site of this battle would be near a village called, in Vietnamese, &quot;Seat of the Border County Prefecture&quot; located in a distant valley of north-western Vietnam near the Laotian border. The French high command, under General Henri Navarre, reasoned that such remote location could not be successfully attacked. General Vo Nguyen Giap thought the position was nearly impossible to defend. The siege of Dien Bien Phu would be the result.&#10;&#10;Vall&eacute;e de la mort is a simulation of this epic siege that ended the French colonial presence in Asia and marked the beginning of a 21-year struggle for national unification. The game is designed for 2 players, one taking the role of the French commander of the fortress complex at Dien Bien Phu, the other of General Giap commanding the Viet-Minh forces laying siege. The game and scenarios are small enough to be played solitaire, however.&#10;&#10;"

The local governments disliked threats to their traditions of self-rule, and heavy taxes to support foreign wars. At the same time the Protestant Reformation, which was sweeping Europe, found ready acceptance among the affluent, literate Dutch. There was little enough to bind the independent-minded Dutch to the distant Habsburg possessions in Spain and Austria, but the devout Catholicism of the Emperors and their Inquisition now made war inevitable. When the rebellion commenced in 1566, neither side foresaw either the decades of bloody civil war or the formation of an independent Dutch State.&#10;&#10;The Dutch Revolt is a simulation of this conflict. One player commands the Catholic forces of the Habsburg Empire under King Philip II of Spain. The other player commands the Dutch Protestant forces under William of Orange.&#10;&#10;"

The dealer MUST try to take 7 tricks, but she gets to declare which suit is trump AFTER looking at her hand.  She then gets to pick up the 4 middle cards, and discard 4 face-down (could be from the kitty, or not).  Player 2 must get 4 tricks, player 3 for 1 trick, and player 4 need not take any.&#10;&#10;After round 1, figure out how many cards more or less players got.  YOu get one point for every trick you make above your required tricks, and lose one for every trick you fail to make.  For the next round, a player who had MORE in the previous round can then pass one card per amount more to a player who had less; that lesser player must then pass their HIGHEST card in each requested suit.  Some pre-defined ordering for this is necessary; the player needing to make the most tricks has precedence over the player needing less.&#10;&#10;For example, in round 1, the players take 6-2-3-1 tricks.&#10;So, the position 2 is now the new dealer.  Player in position 3 was +2 in round 1 (took 3, needed 1), and would ask position 1 for 1 suit, and position 2 for 1 suit.  Player in position 4 would then ask position 2 for 1 suit.  We've played where if the numbers over/under match (position 3&amp;2, 4&amp;1 in this example), then they could simply swap cards too.&#10;&#10;Play then proceeds as described above.  Trump is declared AFTER the card-swapping is done.  And if the player who needed 4 in the previous round took NONE, then they can also look at the kitty too before declaring a trump!  However, they'd also have just given up 4 good cards to other players...\&#10;Game ends after either 2 or 3 rounds, with everyone getting a chance at each position an equal number of times.&#10;&#10;"

Fiasco distinctively incorporates six suits representing symbols of power and wealth and features the legendary character Fiasco.&#10;&#10;A game for advanced card players, Fiasco is easy to learn but a challenge to master. First, select your favorite suit. Choose from horses, swords, mandolins, roses, books or treasure chests. Now do your best to collect them all. Play high cards to win the pot and accumulate points. But here&rsquo;s the twist: Playing high cards also gives your opponents the opportunity to hit you with Fiasco penalty cards. Avoid the danger by laying low, but lose the chance to win your points.&#10;&#10;"

I've been an alarmist eco-nut since the 60's, when as editor of the Los Angeles Free Press, the grandaddy of the underground press, I became aware of the man-made threats to habitation on the planet. In 1980, I created Save the World, the cooperative environmental board game. Players were confronted with all the threats to the planet and offered all the solutions, with the idea of taking them out into real life.  So far, the game has not achieve its mission. When I started research for Save the World, I didn't think we'd be around this long. After two years of study, I concluded that a small number of humans would survive, and a small number of other species: some consolation, I guess. I'm pleasantly surprised that we're still here, but the long-term prospects are still not encouraging.&quot;&#10;&#10;"
