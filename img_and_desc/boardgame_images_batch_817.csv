In the end, the player with the most knight virtue will be the knight exemplar and bathe in the praise and applause of the crowds.&#10;&#10;Briefly speaking, there are three actions players take in Chivalry: Rest, Patrol, and Promote. Rest is the phase for knights to stay and prepare their equipment and supplies, while Patrol is the phase to gather everything you need in the kingdom, or go to castle to get reward from the King. The most important phase is Promote, which symbolized your conquering of the trials and earn yourself knight virtues to elevate in the knight rank. Whenever a knight being promoted, there will be extra bonus for him to manifest the nobility. The game ends when any player collects the designated number of knight virtues, and the one with most virtues wins this game.&#10;&#10;"

The Castle Strife Games website, CastleStrife.com, includes a full description and rules for all 4 variants:  (traditional chess is Level 1), Castle Siege Chess (Level 2), Castle Action Chess (Level 3), Castle Attack Chess (Level 4), and the team game Castle Challenge Chess (Level 5). The games are for sale on Etsy.com. More information, including how to play, is on CastleStrife.com. Pictures of VCU students playing the games at the Chess Club at VCU can be seen at the Castle Chess Club meetup site.&#10;&#10;Castle Siege Chess has been programmed in Zillions of Games and can be played on a registered copy of Zillions of Games 2.0 or higher (maybe even 1.0).

It can even be played online through Zillions of Games.&#10;&#10;The circular chess board is actually a circular board merged with a square board in its center. Byzantine Chess (aka Circular Chess) is played on a 4 track circular board with a hole in the center. It has 2 directions of attack on the opponent's starting position. I (Rich VanDeventer, inventor, designer, developer, and publisher of Castle Strife Games) decided to merge a 6x6 square chess board into the hole and morph it into the inner ring of the circular board so that all chess paths progressed smoothly from the square area into the circular area. I ended up with 3 circular paths, 1 transition circular path, and a 4x4 square center and I named the board CirSquare 96 (it has 96 spaces). In merging a square with a circle, I could not avoid having 4 triangular spaces in the transition circle. Those 4 triangular spaces have turned out to be one of the main advantages of the board. Not only does the CirSquare 96 chess board have 3 directions (front and two sides) of attack (versus a traditional chess board's 1 direction of attack--frontal only) on the opponent's castle (starting area), but the 4 triangles provide a way for the Queen, Rook, and Bishop to gain a 5th direction of coverage when their paths pass through a triangular space, because they can exit either of the other two corners or sides (depending on how they entered the triangular space).&#10;&#10;The CirSquare 96 is exactly 50% larger than an 8x8 chess board. If all 24 spaces in each castle are used for pieces, it has exactly 50% more pieces than traditional chess. So the ratio of starting pieces to open spaces in the battlefield (the 4 rows of spaces between the castles) is 1:1, which is the same as traditional chess, so the board has the same feeling of openness at the beginning of the game.&#10;&#10;All the traditional chess pieces move the same as they do in traditional chess. You can also castle, if you use the standard setup for the traditional chess pieces. Since the board is 12 squares wide across the battlefield, there are 12 Pawns, which of course is 4 more than traditional chess. If you use only the standard 8 pieces of a traditional chess set that are not Pawns, there will be 4 spaces in the back of the castle that are open. That is how I initially played the game. It played very well, but felt too much like traditional chess. So I decided to come up with pieces to fill those 4 spaces. First, I used 2 more Knights and 2 more Bishops. That provided very strong armies, but it was not different enough for me. So started a search for medieval warriors that the traditional chess set was missing.&#10;&#10;I began looking at medieval war paintings and soon realized that the main things missing were Archers and Catapults. So I put 2 Archers and 2 Catapults in the back of the castles. I made their moves compliment the Knights, Bishops, and Rooks. The Archer became a short-range Bishop that can jump and the Catapult became a short-range Rook that can jump. They have worked out to be outstanding additions to the traditional chess set. Almost everyone who has played Castle Siege Chess at least 3 times has ended up either liking it or loving it. I started a chess club at VCU in Richmond, VA almost 3 years ago and introduced my games to the members. Some of the traditional chess purists did not want to play them, but many of the very good chess players and a lot of the average players played Castle Siege Chess fairly often. Several of the club members switched to playing only Castle Siege Chess, although that was not my intention because I love both traditional chess and my games. Much like Bobby Fischer liked both traditional chess and chess variants.&#10;&#10;A few years later, I decided to try to make Castle Siege Chess more like conducting a real medieval war on a chess board. I added Action cards to Castle Siege Chess to get Castle Action Chess. The Action cards are mainly used to give special moves to pieces that they normally could not perform. That eventually worked out quite well, but there was still a lot of aspects of medieval war action were missing.&#10;&#10;So I began thinking about what else was missing. What about weapons? So I added weapons to Castle Action Chess and got Castle Attack Chess. Weapons allow your pieces to capture opponent's pieces without having to move your piece--the weapon makes the move. That soon began working very well, and was quite popular among several of the chess club members. But there was still a lot of medieval war activity that was missing.&#10;&#10;Then I started really thinking hard about what else was missing. I came up with:  money to buy weapons and captured pieces; reinforcements; a dungeon and oubliette for captured pieces; challenges between pieces; and, a team of players (General, Commander, and Finance Officer) for each side. To make it all work, I added aspects of other board games:  dice, action cards, power cards, and time cards. I also came up with Catastrophe cards. I added more weapons--both offensive weapons for the pieces and defensive &amp; offensive weapons for the board. It took several years of play testing to work out the kinks, but the game is now quite perfected. And it is a blast to play once all the players have played it at least 3 times so they know it quite well.&#10;&#10;Besides CastleStrife.com, you can also go to my meetup site--Castle Chess Club meetup--to see hundreds of pictures of the Chess Club at VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University) in action playing both traditional chess and my Castle Strife Games (mainly Castle Siege Chess). We even had several Castle Siege Chess tournaments. My games are for sale on Etsy.com, just use the Etsy search field to find Castle Siege Chess. Links to all my games are on each listing.

Seven cards are dealt to each player. Players simultaneously use some or all of their cards to create one babel each. A babel is a shorthand form of a word or phrase. (The idea is reminiscent of the game Inklings.) Then, players take turns guessing one another&rsquo;s babels. Both the babeler and the first correct guesser receive the same score, which is the number of letters in the babel&rsquo;s meaning. For example, GDR, meaning German Democratic Republic, is worth 24 points. 3 GD LYR, meaning &ldquo;three good liars,&rdquo; is worth 14 points. Play an agreed-upon number of rounds.&#10;&#10;"

The nine cards in each of the five non-cheese foods (suits) are numbered in such a way that each such suit contains three triplets that add up to twenty five, eg, 4, 6, and 15. The object is to collect the most triplets. Each player begins with a hand of five cards. In turn order, a player asks for a food. Every player who has a card or cards of that food in her hand must offer all of those cards  and no others to the questioner. Players who do not have that food in their hands may either sit out or bluff by offering the questioner one or more cards of any type. The questioner chooses one offer, sight unseen, and adds those cards to her hand. Players meld their triplets when they create them. Play continues until only the cheese cards remain in players&rsquo; hands. Players score one point for each melded triplet and minus one for each cheese card in their hands.&#10;&#10;"

Such a situation would most likely occur if either or both the following two developments took place: 1) the Taiwanese officially declared their independence; and/or 2) the mainland Chinese learned the islanders had gotten, or were about to get, nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player wargame of low-intermediate complexity that posits the critical ground-phase of this might-be war as lasting no longer than about two weeks. Such a campaign would most likely have to be preceded by a roughly equal period during which the mainlanders would use aero-naval bombardment to neutralize the ships and planes of the defenders--a long established prerequisite for oceanic invasions of this type.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game that preliminary step is presumed to have been completed. The follow-on ground war would likely be supremely violent in regard to how wars have recently been judged, but would have to be limited as to its duration. After a total crisis--aero-naval and ground--of about a month, it's most likely some kind of negotiated settlement would have to be put in place (barring the complete conquest of Taiwan) due to the inescapable economic, political and social disarray both sides would be put through by such a supreme effort.&#10;&#10;In sum, then, the Chinese player is attempting to seize as much of the urban area of Taiwan as he can, while his opponent is seeking to contain the invaders' beachhead in as small an area as possible. The operational goal of the Chinese is to seize enough territory to render Taiwan inoperable as an independent polity or, failing that, at least create a lodgment large enough to force the islanders to grant major concessions in order to get them to leave.&#10;&#10;Though designed for two-player use, the game is easily adapted for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Both sides orders of battle are drawn from the most recent and complete unclassified sources available. Of course, the overall Chinese ground force goes way beyond the units included in the game. For this invasion, however, about the most that could be supplied would be their airborne divisions, their special forces groups, their marine brigades, their purpose-organized amphibious regular army units, and the line units of the Nanjing Military District. (Due to its proximate geographic location in relation to Taiwan, the NMD would be the higher-level headquarters most likely to be directing this operation.) The entire Taiwanese ground force order of battle--when represented at this scale within these system parameters--is included.&#10;&#10;Players will quickly notice there's no possibility for non-Chinese intervention into the air or ground war in the game. That's because it's not reasonable to believe the PRC would risk a wider war by launching this operation unless they'd first managed to diplomatically isolate Taiwan, at least temporarily, while the rest of the world judged whether any aid effort was worthwhile or even viable.&#10;&#10;The exception to that is in the cyberwarfare rules. In that arena of &quot;war in the cloud,&quot; it seems likely the Taiwanese would have major (though certainly still clandestine) support of many of the world's democratic governments as well as hordes of politically unaffiliated techies. Whether such efforts can prove decisive remains one of the great unanswered questions of 21st century warfare.&#10;&#10;Another overarching characteristic of the game is its unforgiving combat resolution subsystem. That is, there's no possibility of retreat from battle: all combat results are sustained as strength losses. That's to reflect the fact we have here two well armed forces, both highly motivated to achieve their objectives, and both armed to the teeth with the most lethal modern weaponry available. At the same time, both militaries would be new to warfare of this intensity.&#10;&#10;We're also assuming the invasion isn't being made during the monsoon season, so there are no rules for severe weather.&#10;&#10;Projected Contents:&#10;One 22x34&quot; map/playing surface&#10;One sheet of 5/8&quot; mounted, die-cut playing pieces&#10;One rules book&#10;Charts and tables&#10;Dice&#10;Game Box&#10;&#10;"

The front of each card has triangles, crosses and circles in one of three colors; those are the things you count. The back of each card has one or two shapeless colors, or maybe one or two colorless shapes; this tells you what to count.&#10;&#10;During play, a card is flipped over and you count the things denoted on the newly-revealed back on the newly-revealed front. Each time you win, you collect the card. Now you count the shapes/colors not only in the middle, but also in your personal area!

The clandestine Project for the Assessment of Latent Psychic Ability Control and Awareness (ALPACA) is seeking talented operatives. Players will compete head to head against another candidate to see who will move on to become a full-fledged member of Project ALPACA.&#10;&#10;Project ALPACA is a quick round-based two player strategy card game. In the game, players attempt to have the highest Strength value by playing psychic Ability cards that benefit them in the round. Each round is played simultaneously, so players must try to deduce their opponent's plays.&#10;&#10;Project ALPACA is played over 10 rounds in which players attempt to achieve the highest Strength value. Each player has a small deck of 10 Strength cards [1 - 10]. Each player starts the round by flipping over the top card of their Strength deck, revealing the top card. The player with the highest Strength value wins the round, scoring a point. After 10 rounds, the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;To make things more interesting, players have a psychic Ability deck they will use to change the outcome of the round. This includes changes such as adding to their Strength value, subtracting from their opponent's Strength value, or even reversing the win condition, making it so that the lowest Strength value wins.&#10;&#10;"
