125384,,"It is the year 2592. After countless years of war and struggle, the Defense of United Colonies (DUC) has triumphed against the Galactic Ordered Terrorists (GOT). Humanity now has high hopes for this new Era, as everywhere people attempt to rebuild the devastated worlds of the UC. &#10;But its hopes were dashed to pieces as a new enemy, the Horde, rose through the depths of the planet, Telocto, ravishing its colonists, and breaching evacuation ships, got to new planets. In a matter of a few months, over half of the UC&rsquo;s planets were infected. The only known way to defeat them is to glass infected planets, destroying any life support that planet has. On the planet known as Sow, a force of seasoned, grizzled veterans, known as the Condors, attempt one last stand, before they are exterminated.&#10;&#10;Condors of Sow is a cooperative game for 1-4 players, as they attempt to complete each mission. Using a token and a pencil for each player you will have three actions on your turn: move, attack, pick up an item, revive player, reload, or overkill move.&#10;&#10;After players move, The Horde move, by having players mark one dot at the end of a predetermined number lines closest to them.&#10;&#10;All this game needs is a player sheet, a map, and a pencil and token per player.&#10;&#10;Players have the use of multiple weapons and tactics. You must use cover, or you will die. Fight hard Condors! Humanity&rsquo;s last hope is you.&#10;&#10;"

Other than the double-blank, no blanks can touch the edge of another blank. Pawns are set on any five of the blanks, dice are rolled, and the timer is flipped.&#10;&#10;Players examine the board and call out bids. When the timer ends, the high bidder must move the pawns to spaces with a sum that meets the bid. (There is also a special bid for landing all five pawns on matching spaces.) Meeting the bid wins the stake. (The publisher suggests candy or beer, but scoring one point would suffice.) Failure pays an equal stake to every opponent!&#10;&#10;Pawns move orthogonally the number of spaces indicated by their corresponding die.

One of the players has all nine pyramids of lighter colors (white, yellow, red), the second has all nine pyramids of darker colors (green, blue, black).&#10;Start of the Game&#10;&#10;The younger player rolls the die.

Take any two pyramids and challenge players to find the third pyramid required to form a Troika. Practice this several times.&#10;End Game&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player creates TROIKA in a row or column or one of two main diagonals on the board. This player is the winner.&#10;&#10;If a player has at least one of his pyramids, but cannot place any of them, he loses the game.&#10;If both players run out of all their pyramids and no player created TROIKA, the player who did NOT start the game, wins.&#10;&#10;(For this reason it is good to keep the die next to the game board.)&#10;&#10;Rules of 5 games: http://www.mwe.cz/images/gettingstartedwithpyramids.pdf&#10;To buy: http://mwe.cz/cart/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=73&#10;&#10;"

When a player has passed twice, he can no longer influence that round. After everyone has passed twice, the round ends, and points are totalled to calculate the value of that deal. Players then earn money for each &quot;cut&quot; or piece of the action that they have, which represents their share of that deal.

Neither the designer nor anyone else is allowed to make any financial profit from it.&#10;&#10;About the game:&#10;&#10;I hope you remember the great movie &ldquo;Inception&rdquo;. Cobb and his team of Extractors are offered a job to implant an idea into a person&acute;s mind by infiltrating his dreams. The target is Fischer and the client is Saito, who will profit greatly from Fischer's new &ldquo;idea&rdquo;. The reward: a lot of money and the chance for Cobb to return home to see his children. But to plant a thought deep enough into someone&acute;s mind, you&acute;ll have to go very deep. A dream within a dream&hellip; within another dream. And if you die in a dream, you&acute;ll end up in Limbo and probably go mad.&#10;&#10;Guide Cobb and his team through the different dream levels. Recruit your team members and sedate Fischer in the waking reality. Step deeper into his dreams, plant Inceptions, and prepare for the final Kick that&acute;ll bring the team back home.

And some of your team might end up in Limbo and have to be saved first before they can return to reality.&#10;&#10;About the gameplay:&#10;&#10;Inception is a solo (1-player) card game with a playing time of around 50 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each turn the player draws 2 cards to his hand. Some negative cards (Cobb&acute;s Flashbacks) apply immediately, while the others may be played in the &ldquo;Play cards&rdquo; step. Cards may be played in different ways. They may be discarded to use their one-shop effects. Weapon cards may be attached to a character to increase his strength against attacks. Other cards may be placed in a dedicated &ldquo;Convince Display&rdquo; from which they may be played when trying to convince opponents or to plant Inceptions. But the player should also keep some cards in his hand, to either react to new Events or boost his strength when defending against an attacker. These are the tactical choices that have to be made and that will determine success or failure.&#10;&#10;An Event card is drawn from the Dream Level the Characters are currently in. You will have to evade attacks, convince people, plant Inceptions in Fischer&acute;s mind, and face other challenges. Team members might die, as in the movie, and have to be found in Limbo and convinced to come back with you.&#10;&#10;To win the game, the final Inception on Fischer has to be successful, Mal must be dead, and Saito, Cobb, and enough members for the final Kick must still be alive.&#10;&#10;Designed for the BGG Solitaire Print and Play Contest 2012.&#10;&#10;Inception is available as Print and Play (see file section) via ArtsCow, Printerstudio (thanks Jay) as PC game (thanks David) and as Vassal module.

But the Allies still had to push the Germans back behind the Siegfried Line before they could resume their strike into the Reich. By January 13&mdash;eleven days after it was launched &mdash;the counteroffensive had expanded far enough to the east along the battle line to engage the American 30th Infantry Division into the fight, with the capture of St. Vith as a first objective. While its sister regiments were plowing south over the hills, the 120th Regiment was locked in a bitter three-day struggle for Thirimont, a ridge village which controlled the east flank of the attack. By irony of fate, this village was defended by the 1st Battalion of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, the same unit, whose soldiers so full of confidence, earlier rode on the tanks of the powerful Kampfgruppe Peiper, and had traversed Thirimont one month earlier on the way to the Meuse bridges.&#10;&#10;Here comes an entirely NEW way to enjoy your ATS gaming: Geomorphic boards that link in a myriad of ways!

Each player uses a different coloured pencil. In a turn you can set your speed, which starts at 1. This lets you move one square. On subsequent turns you can increase or decrease your spped by 1. So a car travelling at speed 3 may, next turn, go down to 2, go up to 4, or to stay at 3.&#10;&#10;Your move is drawn on to the board, so different colored pencils or pens is essential. All movement must be in a straight line for each move, so you can only change direction on your next throw, and so on. Thus, it is possible to crash if you go too fast around a corner.
