One player takes the role of the mythical hero Perseus, and his opponent assumes control of his quarry, the serpentine Medusa.&#10;&#10;At his disposal, Perseus has four Greek soldiers to help corner and behead the, once beautiful beast, whose very expression now turns people to stone. His equipment includes treasures gifted to him by various Olympians and the Hesperides: a polished shield, adamantine sword, and a knapsack kibisis to safely contain Medusa's head.&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Perseus and the Sanctum of the Medusa is played without a board or map, with cards placed out by the Perseus player to simulate the Greeks' investigation of the column and statue strewn chamber. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Greeks petrified, or slain by bowshot and acid pool frequently.&#10;&#10;Drawn partially from Greek myth, the game is inspired hugely by the 1981 film Clash of the Titans.&#10;&#10;The game's lineage can be traced back to Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;"

The game is a limited edition and will not replace the original Scrabble.&#10;&#10;Just like regular Scrabble, each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.&#10;&#10;Not all precise details are known yet as Scrabble Trickster is due out in July in the U.K. only.&#10;&#10;"

There are no lineups to decide upon and no score sheets to fill out yet the game unfolds inning by inning with a key player and action being revealed along the way. While it can be used to add on to existing full play baseball games, such as Inside Pitch Baseball, it can also hold its own as a season replay game.&#10;&#10;Each team is represented by a single chart that shows all of the possible players and how they effect scoring in an inning when called upon to deliver as a key player. It could be the 3rd string catcher that comes through or maybe your backup shortstop. One roll per inning gets you all the action plus all the pitchers stats for that inning.&#10;&#10;All hitters are rated for, basically, runs created. This is how runs can be scored during an inning. They also have ratings for HR, 3B, 2B, SB and hits in general. How often a hitter is called upon is based on how many plate appearances he had during the season being replayed. The bigger the hit type, a HR beats a single, the better chance to have that big inning. How many runs a team scored in an inning during the year is recreated with Scoreboard as each team has its own scoring chart.&#10;&#10;Pitchers are rated on H, K and BBs. They also have ratings which can cause runs to score in an inning or block potential runs from scoring. The pitchers' stay in the game relies upon how many hits, runs and walks he gives up in his stint. Deciding who pitches doesn't slow the game down as pitchers have start and relief ranges that you can use to &quot;coach&quot; the team.&#10;&#10;Relievers are not left out of the mix as all their appearances and stats can be tracked as well. When to bring in a certain reliever is also covered with 7 different scoring/inning breakdowns that are based upon actual year appearances. Your middle guys will come in at the proper times and be effective (non-effective) just like the year the charts recreate.&#10;&#10;While most stats are gathered during the game some loose ends must be accounted for at games' end. These are handled with each player given ranges to fill in those RBI and hit stats so that the score sheet comes out even.&#10;&#10;You don't just roll for a final score in Scoreboard but you get the ebb and flow of the game broken down per inning. Sometimes your less than stellar players will need to come through in a pinch recreating the excitement of a play-by-play game just done quicker. By the end of the game, you will have these stats for the players as well as see when and how they happened in the game.&#10;&#10;Pitchers: W, L, SV, IP, H, R, ER, K, BB&#10;&#10;Hitters: H, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, RBI&#10;&#10;After a series or two from a team, multipliers are given to each player to show how many AB he would have based on the number of games his team has played. This can be used to get you batting average leaders, etc... for your league.&#10;&#10;Get on the Board with Scoreboard Baseball!&#10;&#10;"

But Battle players are not limited - they can use all of the Untold cards to change and make their units unique, or even create their own character, just as if they were going to play the roleplaying game.

One player represents the German army and the other the Soviet army. The final chapter in the destruction of  Third Reich began on April when  Stalin unleashed the brutal power of  20 armies, 6,300 tanks and 8,500 aircraft  with the objective  of  crushing  German  resistance and  capturing  Berlin.  The depleted  German forces put  up a stiff  defense, initially  repelling the  attacking Russians, but  ultimately succumbing to  overwhelming  force. The  Soviet army  surrounded the city  slowly tightening its stranglehold on the remaining defenders. Fighting street-to-street and house-to-house, Russian troops blasted their way towards the city's center.&#10;Game&rsquo;s Goal&#10;The Soviet army must reach the Reichstag and defeat the defending German troops at that area by outnumbering them by at least 2 to 1.

One player takes the role of the Colonial Marines, and his opponent assumes control of the hordes of deadly xenomorphs.&#10;&#10;At their disposal, the Colonial Marines - very tough hombres - have a roster of high-tech, state-of-the-art weaponry.&#10;&#10;The Alien player's objective is to eliminate all the Marines, before they escape the planet and &quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Aliens: This Time it's War is played using a 5-column system, representing consecutive melees. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Marines butchered frequently, and aliens destroyed by the well-placed use of cards.&#10;&#10;Numerous tricky decisions must be made throughout. For instance, the Colonial Marine player could choose to deploy the Powerloader during the Reactor Chamber battle, but the resources that this would require make it a very risky, but rewarding, play. Similarly, the Alien player can deploy the Alien Queen at any time during the conflict - she's free to play aboard the Sulaco, but hugely expensive if used during the APC Withdrawal, for instance.&#10;&#10;Primarily a combat-driven card game, each player must manage his deck of cards effectively to win. In addition to simple, unique abilities, each card also has two values: power and cost. No icons are used.&#10;&#10;Aliens: This Time it's War can trace its parentage back to San Juan, Magic: The Gathering, Battle Line, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Colonial Marine player wins if she manages to &quot;Nuke the entire site from orbit&quot;.&#10;     The Colonial Marine player wins if she reaches and survives the Sulaco Loading Bay battle.&#10;     The Alien player wins if Ripley and all the Colonial Marines are either killed or cocooned.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The Greeks had a word for it, Deipnosophy, from the words Deipnon - dinner, and Sophist - wise man, which when combined mean Skilled in Dining and Table Talk!&#10;&#10;Stimulating and fun to play, this gourmet After-Dinner Game combines Luck, Skill &amp; Team Strategy to win.&#10;&#10;-(from the box cover)&#10;&#10;&quot;Table Talk&quot; is a food-related trivia game. Each team receives a &quot;Menu&quot; of 600 questions and answers, and appoints a &quot;Chef&quot; (team captain) to ask the questions of the opposing team, operate the timer, record the score, etc. Each chef, in turn, will ask successive players on the opposing team a question: if the team confers (answering &quot;Table d'h&ocirc;te&quot;) and answer correctly, they score a point; however, if the player asked chooses to answer without conferring with his teammates (&quot;&Agrave; la carte&quot;), a correct answer scores 2 points.&#10;&#10;Each page of the Menu provides questions in the following categories, in order: Starters; Main Course; Side Dishes; Desserts, Savouries &amp; Cheese Board; Wine List; and Culinary Trivia - &quot;Table Talk&quot;. Questions must be asked in the order they appear in the Menu: players do not have a choice of the category of the question.

There are several suggestions for solitaire puzzles, but also a multiplayer game idea:&#10;&#10;An architect and a master builder are chosen from among the players. The other players are builders. The master builder choses a piece as the base, the architect adds another piece on top of it (the pieces are interlocking). Then all players take turns adding another piece. The &quot;building&quot; has to remain stable and it is not allowed to block the next player. The players may hold the building while adding their piece; when they think it is stable they let go. If it collapses, the player who caused that is penalized, so is the architect. If all pieces are used up, all players get points with the architect getting a bonus. Several rounds are played and points are noted. When the players decide to end the game, the player with most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are several versions of this game, using different materials: wood, aluminum etc.&#10;&#10;"

Once all but one person has passed on increasing the target bid, a second category is revealed and each player then lists as many items as possible &ndash; but from only one of the two categories. Players then compare answers and mark out duplicates, scoring one point for each unique answer; the bidder scores two points for each unique answer, but only if he meets his bid. In addition, each player scores additional points if he listed more answers than the number bid.&#10;&#10;"

One player manages the tuareg pieces and the rest are explorer looking for clues in different cities. When they draw the right cards, they can do an excavation and look one of eight treasure locations (represented by eight face down cards). When a player believes to know where the treasure is hidden, he moves his piece to that location and do an excavation; if it's correct he wins the game. The tuareg player have different rules to move his camel pieces and also can obstruct other players actions.&#10;&#10;From the back of the box art: &quot;Hace mucho tiempo los tuaregs, tribu n&oacute;mada del desierto del S&aacute;hara, encontraron una gran parte del legendario tesoro del Rey Salom&oacute;n, regalo de la Reina de Saba. El hallazgo fue por casualidad, mientras excavaban buscando un pozo enterrado por una tormenta de arena. La codicia que tal tesoro despert&oacute; consigui&oacute; romper la armon&iacute;a que hasta entonces reinaba entre este pueblo del desierto. Muchos tuaregs murieron por culpa del antiguo tesoro y Halim el Sabio, Se&ntilde;or de las duna, qued&oacute; tan apenado que mand&oacute; a sus s&uacute;bditos que enterraran el tesoro de nuevo en el desierto. Hombre previsor, Halim pens&oacute; que quiz&aacute;s en el futuro el tesoro podr&iacute;a ser &uacute;til a su pueblo, as&iacute; que esparci&oacute; pistas falsas y verdaderas por todo el desierto, para que solo &eacute;l o sus descendientes superan el lugar donde el tesoro estaba enterrado. Pero sucedi&oacute; que su bisnieto Al Denir, el Bienmandado muri&oacute; sin descendencia, y el tesoro de los tuaregs y su situaci&oacute;n se convirti&oacute; con el tiempo en tan solo una leyenda, una historia para contar junto al fuego las largas y fr&iacute;as noches del desierto...&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Published in 1972. A rummy game featuring Charlie Chaplin imagery.&#10;&#10;The game play is that of a basic rummy game. Seven card hands are dealt, runs of three with matching suit are required by the rules. The winner is the first to finish their hand.&#10;&#10;The suits are related to Charlie Chaplin's general image; Canes, Shoes (untied), Neckties, and Hats.&#10;&#10;This game is interesting because the card backs are unique to each card. This theoretically enables a player to memorize the deck. Each card is unique because it has a flip book of Charlie Chaplin on the card backs. He is twirling his cane. Each card is numbered on the back so that the flip book movie can be played in order.&#10;&#10;"
