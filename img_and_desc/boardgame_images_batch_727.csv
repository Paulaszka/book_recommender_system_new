Multiple climbing routes and ten different mountain sides result in over twenty million game combinations.&#10;&#10;Gameplay involves players rolling dice to determine weather and climbing conditions, trading with other players to obtain climbing gear, and selling the climbing gear to purchase special upgrades. Upgrades can increase climbing efficiency, change climbing conditions, sabotage other players, and even pay for helicopter flights to another place on the mountain. As players climb, they mark where they have been, resulting in the mountain displaying their trail and potentially blocking other players from climbing in that area.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to finish all of the climbing routes and place as many route markers on the mountain as possible. This earns climbing points, with the player having the most climbing points winning the game.&#10;&#10;"

The Micro Game Challenge was judged by board game critic Cyrus Kirby, who is better known as Father Geek, and by the podcast team at All Us Geeks.&#10;&#10;Dig Down Dwarf is a fast and casual game that is fun for all ages and all skill levels. Newcomers will be attracted to the easy-to-learn rules and press-your-luck mechanics, while skilled gamers will love the ability to alter dice rolls by spending gems and to activate special dwarven powers. There is a bit of something for everyone, and the quick playtime and portability make it a great travel game and an outstanding filler game as well.&#10;&#10;What is New in the Second Edition&#10;&#10;Objective Cards - This new edition will come with 18 Objective Cards. Players will randomly draw 3 at the beginning of the game and these will become a way to score bonus points at the games end. Players decide, as a group, if the objectives are be kept secret or placed up for all to see.&#10;&#10;New Artwork - Second Edition comes with clean new graphic design work and artwork throughout. You will still recognize some of the icons and fonts, but the new design is meant to convey a sense of nostalgia.&#10;&#10;More Gems - Second Edition comes with 20% more of the shiny gems that made the First Edition such a smash hit!&#10;&#10;Six Player Support - With the addition of extra gems and other components, Dig Down Dwarf Second Edition can host up to six players.&#10;&#10;New Dwarf Power Cards - These new cards utilize acrylic cubes to track the dwarven skills you have unlocked during the course of the game, instead of rotating the card like you had to do in the older version.&#10;&#10;New Dice Colors - Like the new Dwarf Power Cards, we have listened to the feedback over the course of hundreds of plays since the first Kickstarter over two years ago. One thing I noticed was players not noticing that they triggered a dwarf power, because each dice was a different color and it was too much to keep track of for many. A very simple solution has been implemented. You now roll three black dice and one red die on your turn. The red die activates everyone's dwarven powers.&#10;&#10;New Gem Colors - Another complaint we got was that some of the gems looked alike in color. We made sure to make that a non-issue this time around. Star gems are now really yellow and we are now able to manufacture the gems in black for the cursite (fossilized dragon dung) which further helps distinguish each gem type.&#10;&#10;"

Do you have the stamina, speed and strength to be the victor!&#10;&#10;A boxing themed card game for 2 players.&#10;&#10;Setup: &#10;Divide the cards into five decks: Fighters, and the four Skills decks - Punch, Dodge, Counter and Cross.&#10;&#10;Shuffle the Fighter deck and give each player two Fighter cards. Players choose one card and place it face up and one card on top of it face down. Use the corner of the face down card to mark the starting stamina of 10 on the face up fighter. Note - each fighter has a unique set of skills and a favored hand.&#10;&#10;Separately shuffle each of the Skill decks and deal a number of cards to each player as listed under &lsquo;Skills&rsquo; for the Fighter&rsquo;s card setting any extra cards aside.&#10;&#10;Then, shuffle all Skill cards previously set aside and deal one to each player. Any remaining cards are removed from the game. &#10;Both players now have a deck of 21 Skill cards. Each player will look at their cards and choose 11 cards to take in hand for the first round. The other 10 cards will be used in the second round and are set aside.&#10;&#10;Types of Skill Cards: &#10;Punch cards are attack cards and deal damage, reducing a player&rsquo;s stamina.&#10;Dodge cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage.&#10;Counter cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage from the other player and then immediately become attack cards and deal stamina damage to the other player.&#10;Cross cards are attack cards and deal stamina damage, and then give a bonus attack value if the next card played by the player is a Punch card.&#10;&#10;Play: &#10;Players will simultaneously choose a card from their hand, placing it face down in front of them. Both players will then reveal their cards at the same time and place them face up in front of them in a row. Players then assess who will take stamina damage based on the two cards just played.&#10;&#10;After 10 cards are played in the first round, both players will place their 11th card in front of them and add the number in the upper right of the card to the current stamina on their Fighter card. This is the only time stamina is added to a player&rsquo;s total.&#10;&#10;Both players will then take the remaining 10 cards into their hand and fight a second round. If at any point, during any round, a player&rsquo;s stamina is reduced to zero that player is knocked out and the other player wins. The player with the higher stamina after two rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;If, after two rounds, players have the same stamina value, each player will choose 10 cards from their deck of 21 and will compete in a third and final round. If players are still tied after a third round, the match is a draw.&#10;&#10;"

You and your team decide to infiltrate and investigate the ritual anonymously, in the hope of securing the next exclusive. Without much thought you step into the cellar, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long before you come to regret your decisions. The cellar is a shrine to ancient god and the horrifying ritual is tearing apart the minds of those who participate, causing them to go insane!&#10;&#10;In the dark and musty cellar, worshipers are passing around artifacts. The light is dim so you can&rsquo;t quite make out the artifacts you are passing around. However, further away in the distance you get a glimpse of what others are holding.

Instead, you see the cards other players are holding. You must guess the card you are holding by looking at other players&rsquo; cards and the cards that have already been played.&#10;&#10;The game is played over multiple rounds where each round consists of multiple turns. During each turn, one player draws the top card of the deck, looks at it, and passes it to another player. The player who receives the card has a choice either to a) discard the card he / she is holding face up and take the new card without looking at it, or b) pass the card to another player without looking at it. After a player takes a turn, another player takes his / her turn.&#10;&#10;The round continues until one of the round end conditions is met, at which point all players reveal their cards. At this time, if you are holding a cursed (red) card, then the card corrupts your mind and you lose your sanity. If you are holding a sane (blue) artifact card but some other players are also holding the same artifact card (regardless of their color), the artifacts create an unpleasant resonance, corrupts your mind, and you will lose your sanity. You successfully survive the ritual only if you are holding a unique sane (blue) card.&#10;&#10;Players lose their sanity by discarding sanity markers. New rounds continue until one or more players have lost all their sanity markers. All players who still have sanity markers survive the ritual.

Each game of Warehouse 13: The Board Game is considered a Season, played over a series of Episodes. Each Episode will involve the investigation and retrieval of one artifact. Warehouse Agents must investigate clues, then use those clues to retrieve the artifact. However, one player is the Traitor, who secretly works for the Adversary. For every artifact that is lost, the Adversary becomes more powerful and thereby more difficult to defeat.&#10;&#10;Each Episode begins with the Ping Phase, in which the artifact's location is revealed and clue dice are rolled. Clues are represented by 13 custom six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;After the Ping Phase, the Investigation Phase begins. During the Adversary turn, the Adversary will act. Afterwards, each Agent must perform an Action, such as drawing Traits, playing a Trait, performing Warehouse Maintenance, or traveling to the Field. Next, each Agent must attempt to claim a clue die. If an Agent cannot claim a clue die, one must be neutralized, removing it from play for the remainder of that Episode. Finally, each Agent must draw a free Trait.&#10;&#10;The Investigation Phase repeats until all of the clue dice are either claimed or neutralized, then the Retrieval Phase begins. Each artifact displays symbols that correspond to the symbols on the clue dice. During each round of the Retrieval Phase, the players secretly roll all of their clue dice and each player chooses one to apply to the artifact. The chosen dice are revealed simultaneously. The Adversary will intervene by rolling Goo dice which can neutralize clue dice. If enough clues are applied to match the artifact's symbols, the artifact is retrieved. If the Agents run out of clue dice before rolling enough symbols, the artifact is lost to the Adversary.&#10;&#10;Play then continues to the next Episode. After three artifacts are retrieved, the Warehouse Agents win. However, if three artifacts are lost, the Finale begins, in which the Agents have one last chance to thwart the Adversary's grand scheme.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the Traitor is hidden. The Traitor can impact the game by failing to assist the Warehouse Agents, by failing to claim clues, or by failing to apply clues properly.

Colonization of the New World (and the rivalries there) certainly would have been very different.&#10;&#10;Award-winning game designer Mark McLaughlin brings us a new look at the Armada. Players will use both a Strategic and a Tactical map. While there are few physical unit counters in play, many information chits and dozens of &quot;Event Chits&quot; influence play.&#10;&#10;"

Holding it meant &quot;holding the South together,&quot; with access to all the western men, food, horses, supplies... and Mexican ports. Holding it also meant the Mississippi River could not be freely used by the North, for transporting troops and supplies, nor by Midwestern farmers, for shipping exported goods. Can you, as the Federal forces, match U.S. Grant's finest campaign? Can you, commanding for the Confederacy, gather your scattered troops and create a force strong enough to punish Grant for his audacity?&#10;&#10;This division-level hex-and-counter game includes Grant's Army of the Tennessee, facing off against the oft-at-odds Army of Mississippi of Pemberton and Army of Tennessee of Johnston.&#10;&#10;The sweep and scope of the campaign are included, from Grant's Crossing at Bruinsburg to the finale (or not). Interesting side stories are included, like Grierson's Raid, the CSS Arkansas, and &quot;that devil Forrest&quot; and his part--or not-- in the grand campaign.&#10;&#10;"

204116,,"An alien race known as the Broskams have just finished their annual winter hibernation and there is only one thing on their minds, to get out of the hibernation cave and get some warmth!&#10;&#10;Broskams is a 2-4 player card drafting, simultaneous action selection, tile laying and tile manipulation game that takes place over four rounds. The player with the most warmth points (victory points) at the end of the fourth round is the winner of the game!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round, every player receives 6 cards that represents the different Broskams and each of their special powers. The players will draft these cards one at a time and pass the remaining to the players on their left (and right depending on the round) until they have a new hand of 6 cards. After that, the players will choose one of their 6 cards and reveal them simultaneously. Then, starting with the first player, everyone will use the card they revealed to either place one of their Broskams onto the board (leave the cave) or use the special ability printed on the card, moving their Broskams closer to the sun for more warmth points!&#10;&#10;"

Today, everyone is having a bad day.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;In The Botch, a motley collection of criminals are picking through the wreckage of a massive heist gone massively cock-eyed. There&rsquo;s a fortune&rsquo;s worth of diamonds flying around between the hands of even the small-timer crooks scudding around the Boss&rsquo; empire, and she&rsquo;s not happy.&#10;&#10;Meant to evoke those chaotic crime movies where everything&rsquo;s going wrong, The Botch is a party game of hidden information and ridiculous messes. It&rsquo;s a game about bluffing and nerve, about pulling off a con, and about grabbing the jewels and running. In The Botch, you&rsquo;re going to lie, cheat and steal, and if you&rsquo;re really lucky you&rsquo;ll get out of this with your skin intact.&#10;&#10;The Botch is a hidden-information bluffing game designed to keep things reasonably chaotic and make it hard for players to get an overwhelming edge through experience and memorisation. It&rsquo;s a game to get people into gaming, where things going embarrassingly wrong is part of the design.&#10;&#10;The Botch contains 5 Basic roles and 5 Basic items, which are designed to be played as an entry-level stable game. As you become more comfortable with the game you can add more roles and more items, choosing from an additional 7 Advanced roles and 7 Advanced items.&#10;&#10;First to 10 diamonds ends the game or last alive wins.&#10;&#10;"
