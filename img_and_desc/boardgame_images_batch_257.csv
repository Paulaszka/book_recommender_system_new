The last player with remaining tokens wins the game.&#10; Different from O'NO 99 is the deck of 52 cards. In Jimbo's 99 there are 4 suits (compared to 3 in O'NO 99) and only 16 special cards (compared to 30).&#10;&#10;The special cards here are:&#10;- 4 x &quot;Reverse&quot;&#10;- 4 x &quot;Hold&quot;&#10;- 4 x &quot;Minus 10&quot;&#10;- 4 x &quot;99&quot;&#10;&#10;That means that the &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Double Play&quot; cards were added later.&#10;&#10;"

29514,,"Due to its simple rules and ease of playing, &quot;The Bowl Game&quot; is a perfect party game for mixed groups of non-gamers.&#10;&#10;Much like the parlor game &quot;Celebrity&quot;, players are broken into teams and given slips of paper.  Each player writes down a set number (usually 10) of 'things' on slips of paper.  These 'answers'  are folded up, placed into a bowl (or hat or cup, whatever you have handy), and the game begins.  Each player is  given 1 minute to draw slips of paper, one at a time, and try to get their teammates to guess the answer.  Much like Taboo, no charades (hand gestures) may be used, and no rhyming or &quot;starts with&quot; is allowed.&#10;&#10;The &quot;things&quot; written can be anything that makes sense, and can be conveyed.  Expressions, quotes, famous people, things, etc.  As long as it's not nonsense, it's appropriate.&#10;&#10;When the timer goes off, the team gets one, and only one guess, as to what the last answer was.  The teammates must confer, and come up with a guess.  Usually there's a time limit to this.  If it's guessed correctly, it's a point, otherwise it's tossed back in the bowl.&#10;&#10;The bowl is then passed clockwise, and the next person gets a turn.&#10;&#10;Continue until the bowl is empty.&#10;&#10;"

WYSIWYG borrows some elements from a couple of old games called German Whist and Honeymoon Bridge, while adding in some new ideas of its own.&#10;&#10;WYSIWYG is a trick taking card game for two players. After each player is dealt 13 cards, a hand proceeds in four separate phases. First, each player evaluates their hand and announces the total. Then, a bidding session takes place to establish the hand's trump suit and objective. Next, the players play to tricks, with the winner of each trick replacing their card with their choice of one of two exposed cards and the loser receiving the other card. Each trick is worth one mark. This continues until the deck is depleted. Finally, the players play out the remainder of their cards to tricks, each of which is worth two marks. If the player who set the trump suit has earned marks at least equal to a goal based upon the two hand evaluations and his bid, he wins the hand. Play continues until one of the players scores 50 points.&#10;&#10;(description by Larry Levy)&#10;&#10;"

The letters have point values according to their frequency in the language.  &#10;The Board does not have the Bonus spaces as the Scrabble board does, however. Instead, every space has two Premium letters written in the corner.  Players able to play a matching letter on premium space during to course of play scores double or triple for that letter.  Players successfully placing two or more premium letters in a word score double or triple for the word.&#10;&#10;"

It can be played by two, four or six players either singly, in pairs or teams of three. The components of the game are 36 different octagonal tiles or metagons and a playing board.&#10;&#10;The object of Metagon is to gain tiles from the playing ground. This can be achieved in either of two ways.&#10;&#10;1. The simplest way of winning tiles is to create a straight line with three adjacent tiles having the same coloured motifs in the same relative position on each tile. Lines may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. When a player has formed a straight line, he removes the two tiles placed earlier in the line and places these in a separate 'scoring stack', face up.&#10;&#10;2. The second way of gaining tiles is to form a parallelogram by aligning the same coloured motifs on four tiles in the same relative position on each tile. Parallelograms may be any size and aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally. When a player has placed a parallelogram he removes the three tiles placed earlier and adds these to his scoring stack.&#10;&#10;The game ends when players have placed all their playing stack tiles on the board.  The player with the most tiles in his scoring stack is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

The player controls the US forces landing along the five mile stretch of Omaha Beach on D-Day and their desperate struggle to establish a viable beachhead. The game covers the entire first day at a time scale that varies from 15 minutes per turn (during the initial landings) to 30 minutes per turn later in the day. Units are companies and include assaulting infantry, engineers and amphibious tanks. The game system controls the hidden German defenders in their &quot;Widerstandsnest&quot; resistance points, revealing the defenders and their reserves as the American survivors of the first landing waves make their way up the bluffs. Rules cover amphibious landings, German fields of fire, artillery, tidal movement, and intangibles such as US leadership under fire and the initiative of the American GI. &#10;There are two counter sheets, 55 cards, and one mapsheet.&#10;&#10;Additional Notes:&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=====There are 352 counters. The basic unit size is the US infantry company. German units consist of Widerstandsnest crews and reinforcement infantry companies. US tanks, and some US artillery, AA and anti-tank units are also included. US engineers are represented abstractly, clearing beach obstacles early in the game and opening traffic routes off the beach later in the game.&#10;&#10;The 34&quot; x 22&quot; map depicts the entire 9km long Omaha invasion area and reaching 4km inland, at 250 meters per hex. Hexes are large (almost 1&quot;) so that symbology facilitating German placement, fire and actions can be seen without having to pick up units.&#10;&#10;The time scale is 15 minutes per turn from 0600 hours to 1000 hours, shifting to 1/2 hour turns from 1000 to 1800 hours.&#10;&#10;A deck of 55 cards performs triple duty: determining results of US amphibious landings, determining an event each turn, and determining which German units fire or perform other actions each turn.&#10;&#10;The game's solitaire system is based on that used previously in Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=================Decision Games Omaha Beach official url: http://shop.decisiongames.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=1018%2D4P&#10;&#10;"
