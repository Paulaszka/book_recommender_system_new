The use of FACs keeps the action moving along at a pace simulating the real sport.&#10;&#10;All of the action comes from the players&rsquo; cards with no chart lookups needed. In ITP, each player will have 3 columns per card showing regular offense, offensive rebound and fastbreak sections. In each section the players frequency of 2/3 FGA, drawing fouls, turnovers and assists come into play. For the Dennis Rodman types when the offense does come his way a simple PASS may be the outcome. Each player has separate GOTO ratings where the more they are involved in the offense the better chance you will see him be called upon to make a play. You often see players that don't have great offensive stats (FG%, TO) but these are often guys that have to create offense. If you don't have a any offensive weapons (good or bad) on the floor then you will see the offense bog down in ITP.&#10;&#10;Defense in ITP is not an afterthought and is intertwined into the game at all points. Players are rated separately for steals, blocks, committing fouls and overall defense. A special DENY rating for defensive players works with the aforementioned GOTO ratings where good defenders can actually keep a player from being able to take an action on the court. The defensive ratings come into play in what are called possible defensive stops. There are special notations on the FACs that can possibly stop an offensive action or affect a shot.&#10;&#10;ITP keeps the action moving with a fastbreak system that is simple yet effective to use. The run-and-gun style teams will feel that way as will the plodders. Each player gets a fastbreak rating that shows his propensity to get out on the break and, when he does, his card has a column just for that event.&#10;&#10;The special Momentum Factor (*MOM) is built into the FACs and either gives a team a boost or causes them to miss some shots. The use of timeouts can readjust this factor and keep the game on an even keel but you must use them wisely as timeouts can be very useful towards the end of a game allowing you to call plays and get extra time when you may need it. Managing timeouts can be very challenging. If you use too many timeouts for momentum swings then you will be limited to using your TO's for subs and especially late in a very close game when you want to call a designed play to a specific player. However, not calling timeouts on a momentum run can cause the game to get out of control, thus hurting a teams' chances to win.&#10;&#10;So, if basketball is your game, get out of your seat and get Inside the Paint!&#10;&#10;"

The game contents consist of a deck of 70 cards, each illustrated in a &lsquo;70s/&lsquo;80s retro art style, and a rule sheet, attractively packaged in a small black cardboard box.  Most of what you need to know is printed on the cards themselves and makes picking up and getting into the game very easy.  The use of icons on the cards, representing different aspects of the game (e.g. the discard pile, the play area and your hand of cards), makes the game even easier to understand.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 2 to 6 players of ages 7 and up.  Games can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 30 minutes to play - depending on the experience of players and the number of players in each game.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to be the first player with 100 points down on the table, which isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.  Players have cards that can steal cards you have tabled or send them to the discard pile.  So you need to be able to judge the best time to put cards on the table and how to defend your cards once they are down.&#10;&#10;Game-play is highly interactive and the base rules are simple to follow to make it accessible to casual and non-gamers as well as dedicated gamers.  At the start of play, each person is dealt a hand of five cards.  These cards each have values clearly printed on them, ranging from negative amounts to a maximum of 20 points.  They also have actions printed on them, along with a graphic (which features some pun on vision such as &lsquo;wink&rsquo; or &lsquo;blind spot&rsquo;).  The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.&#10;&#10;While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.&#10;&#10;The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.&#10;&#10;"

Playing a game with SuperSystem requires the following: a copy of these rules, painted miniatures, around 20 six-sided dice (D6&rsquo;s), copies of the SuperSheets printed in the appendix of this book, pencils, and a roughly 4&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; playing area.&#10;&#10;SuperSystem is an ideal game for two players, but more participants can get involved for longer, multi-player games. Battles in SuperSystem can involve as few as two models per side, or as many as ten to thirty models per side. There are two basic types of models in SuperSystem: characters and henchmen. Characters are the heroes and villains that make up the superhuman population of Four-Color Earth, the fictional setting of the game. Henchmen are their underlings, goons, mooks, or cannon fodder. Although some henchmen can also possess superhuman powers, they never rise to levels of the characters.&#10;&#10;Players may fight SuperSystem battles as one-off encounters, or as extended campaigns where their heroes and villains develop unique personalities, gain new abilities, and sometimes suffer grievous injuries. These developments occur over a number of game sessions, and are known in SuperSystem as Series.&#10;&#10;This revises SuperSystem 2nd Edition.&#10;&#10;"
