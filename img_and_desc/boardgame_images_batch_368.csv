It was published by now defunct Swedish company Spo Games AB. Two versions (editions) were made: one in Swedish and one in English. Both carried the English name. The publishing company thought it would be an easy way to learn the golf rules.&#10;&#10;Initially the idea was to release new question-and-answer cards every fourth year (since the rules of golf are updated every fourth year internationally) but it is unknown whether this ever materialised.&#10;&#10;

In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order&#10;&#10;In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.&#10;&#10;Players begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.&#10;&#10;A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3. Each round, players also score points for huts (those built on fertile land between the two rivers bring more points) and ziggurat tiles.&#10;&#10;In comparison to other games from Ystari's series - Assyria is lighter than Caylus, Olympos, Ys or Sylla (in terms of complexity, available choices - represented by numerous tiles, cards, icons, cards etc. that need to be remembered and can be combined during play), but heavier than Yspahan, Mykerinos or Metropolis.&#10;&#10;"

Game is available in print and play version and also via e-book.&#10;&#10;From the Downey Games website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Fast Lane Racing is the culmination of two years worth of design and testing.&#10;&#10;With Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve covered all of the bases.  Every element of open wheel racing is covered from qualifying right down to the checkered flag.&#10;&#10;In Fast Lane racing, drivers are rated separately for qualifying and racing, giving you an extremely accurate picture of each and every driver to get behind the wheel in the 2008 season.  To further enhance the realism, each driver is rated for the various track types run in the open wheel series.  Drivers are also rated for their ability to lead laps, how they perform during pit stops, and tendency to avoid mechanical failures.  You truly get an accurate representation of each driver.&#10;&#10;All tracks are individually rated as well.  Each track is rated for Pole Position Speed, number of caution flags, Racing Speed, and weather.&#10;&#10;Speaking of weather; how many times have you watched a race and heard the drivers and commentators talk about how the track has changed due to weather?  In Fast Lane Racing, we&rsquo;ve replicated this most important facet of racing.  You&rsquo;ll see the effects of a green track following heavy rains.  You&rsquo;ll see drivers run faster laps at Indianapolis as the track closes and the track cools.&#10;&#10;And speaking of Indianapolis, we have replicated EVERY facet of the unique qualifying format of the world&rsquo;s most famous race, right down to the bumping into the field!&#10;&#10;Fast Lane Racing is not a quick play game.  However, we&rsquo;ve compressed the racing into the most exciting elements, giving you a game that plays quickly.  With Fast Lane Racing, you&rsquo;ll be able to realistically complete an entire season.  A typical race and qualifying session takes approximately 40 to 60 minutes total.  If you use actual qualifiers and only run the races, you&rsquo;ll consistently finish within 20 minutes.  And while we have compressed the racing, we have not cut corners.  You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; every detail of the race unfold right on your tabletop!&#10;&#10;Each Fast Lane Racing Year Book contains everything you need to play.  There are no external &ldquo;game parts&rdquo; to buy.&#10;&#10;The printed games feature individual, die-cut driver and track cards, with everything packed in a sturdy game box.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Everywhere the Inmun Gun (the North Korean Army) was in full retreat toward the Chinese border, closely pursued by the victorious Allies.&#10;&#10;Chinese intervention in the war had been considered and dismissed as a bluff by the UN Command. Thus, the UN forces were badly overextended when the bluff materialized as a force of thirty divisions, having infiltrated into the Korean mountains.&#10;&#10;UN forces were sent reeling back to the 38th Parallel in confusion, attempting to reestablish a front line. The Communists followed relentlessly, infiltrating deep into UN positions. They attacked without caution, accepting high casualties in order to sustain momentum.&#10;&#10;Units in Yalu are mostly divisions, with some regiments and battalions. Ground scale is 10 miles per hex and turns are weekly. Weather plays a predominant role, influencing movement and combat options for both sides. Yalu, like no other game, effectively shows the differences in the opposing sides' Rules of Engagement - the two sides simply feel and play differently.&#10;&#10;This is the second edition of Yalu; the first was published in GDW's Conflict Games line in 1977. The 2009, Second Edition of Yalu will be a fully updated version of the game with all new graphics, all known errata included and some additional rule updates.&#10;&#10;Both &quot;New-Look&quot; and &quot;Retro-Look&quot; components. Second Edition Yalu has both &quot;New-Look&quot; and &quot;Retro-Look&quot; map and counters to provide some replay variability. The 1977 rules and the new rules will also be featured.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;     Yalu: The Chinese Counteroffensive in Korea, November 1950 - May 1951&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Poke was published in Esquire Magazine in 1946, and he published Slam himself in 1951. Slam, since it has more rules, came in an approximately 4&quot;x2&quot; white paper booklet. Both of these games would be reprinted in Sackson's book A Gamut of Games in 1969, while Triad would appear (slightly modified) as Pe-Ling in 1970. Triad was then published in GAMES magazine in 1986, while Pe-Ling was presented at Spiel in 1989 and in included in an issue #5 of Spielbox in 1990.&#10;&#10;Triad is similar to Mah Jongg, but uses a special deck made from two decks of cards using only the ace through 8 of each suit. For four players, a third set of cards is added. The rules mostly detail scoring for the various hands that can be formed.&#10;&#10;In this game, players try to combine twelve cards in three sets of four cards, each set belonging to one of the three classes allowed. To do this, players can choose to take a face-up card from the draw pile or a face-down card from the discard pile. A set of the Class 1 type consists of four cards of the same suit. For Class 2 sets, each four cards should be arranged as two pairs, with the sum of the values being 9 (e.g., 2, 2 and 7, 7). Class 3 is about making groups of four cards of the same number (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 2). In each Class, some cards combinations are considered weak, easy or strong, giving 2, 4 or 8 points, respectively. Moreover, there are several conditions and card combinations that add doubling factors progressively to the total sum. In this way, one doubling multiplies the points by a factor of 2, two by 4, three by 8, etc. The game lasts several rounds until a player reaches a predetermined amount of points.&#10;&#10;"

Players then decide if they want to sell and/or buy goods there. Also, every action takes time, and how you spend it is very important. Will you spend more time to reach a bigger planet so that the chances of getting cheap cargo will be bigger? or will you travel to smaller planets, hoping to increase the number of trades even though they may be a bit less profitable? Will you try to sell and buy on the same planet to save traveling time, but risk getting a worse deal on one of the transactions? or will you just do one thing, maximizing profit but wasting more time flying through space? Last, will you risk losing your cargo by selling it where it's illegal?&#10;&#10;"
