You&rsquo;ve just received an email from your favorite convention, promising you a free autographed limited edition item of you choice, but only IF you get there before the other players, who&rsquo;ve also received the same email. The problem? You don&rsquo;t have a car, but as karma has it, neither do the others.&#10;&#10;You must hitchhike your way there using planes, trains and automobiles&hellip; and the occasional bike from the thrift shop. Hey&hellip; it was 99 cents! &#10;On this journey through the continent, you&rsquo;ll hop into cars equipped with NOZ, turbos, and furry dice. You&rsquo;ll encounter some crazy drivers who might occasionally be drunk and take risky jumps just for the hell of it. You&rsquo;ll wish for awesome upgrades to your lift, but the others are wishing just the opposite.&#10;&#10;On your turn, they&rsquo;ll be praying evil things upon you. Whatever they can think of to hinder your speed. They&rsquo;ll throw old ladies and moose if they have to. They&rsquo;ll send birds in your engine or just simply wish for you to crash and burn. But don&rsquo;t worry, their turn will come and vengeance will be sweet.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll have to strategically manage your limited hand size and choose which deck to draw from. Will you draw transportation cards to hopefully get the best ride in the game? Or will you draw some karma cards to boost your current ride and slow the others down.&#10;While on this awesome road trip, you&rsquo;ll have to choose your path, or let the driver take you further on his own path. The GPS will determine this. You&rsquo;ll have to stop at train crossings and travel through snowy hills, sandy deserts, big cities and farmland.&#10;&#10;The race also has two levels of play. You can play the regular way, which is with the special ability text of the cards, or the Junior way. In the junior level, simply play without the text and use only the numbers. This will help young players learn simple math, strategy, and have fun while doing so.&#10;&#10;But just when you thought the race was over, there&rsquo;s more to come&hellip; expansions with new maps, more vehicles, more upgrades and of course&hellip;more mayhem are already in the works. Why do you think we put STAGE 1 on the box?&#10;So pack light, head out there, and hope for the best!&#10;&#10;"

The basic game mechanism is trick-taking, but whoever wins the trick can distribute the cards amongst all the players, depending on his character's ability. Bilbo, for example, must keep one card from the trick, give one card to another player, then discard the remaining cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to a special ability, each character has a special affinity with the forces that govern his motives. Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin are scions of good, while Smaug and Bolg are cruel and evil. The cards respond to these alignments accordingly: a white star on the card symbolizes the forces of good; the helm of an orc adorns cards possessed of evil power; and a card with a pipe grants players the ability to draw an extra card in the next round. If a card with the opposite power is assigned to your character (Gandalf gets an orc helmet, or Smaug gets a star), then that character takes a point of damage. If your character is already damaged and is assigned a card with the symbol of their own side (Bilbo gets a star, or Bolg gets an orc helmet), then that character gets a single point of damage healed. Two points of damage eliminates a character from the game, so use the cards you win to knock out your opponents and heal your allies.&#10;&#10;The round ends when players have emptied their hands, and the last of the cards that were in play have been assigned to the characters. Players who have taken enough damage are eliminated at this point. Depending of the number of players, if enough good characters have survived, the game continues until the final round. If the evil characters have killed enough of the heroes, then the villains win the day!&#10;&#10;"

It uses a 10x10 board and each side has 13 types of pieces.&#10;&#10;The basic description is as follows:&#10;&#10;Sons of Mithra uses the same basic rules as Western Chess (capture the King), but adds or modifies several pieces.&#10;&#10;Piece Descriptions:&#10;&#10;Back-rank pieces:&#10;Leader - moves like the King in regular Chess.  Once per game, it can force an enemy piece to make a move instead.&#10;&#10;Wyrm - moves like a Queen in Chess.  The Wyrm can reincarnate, however - whenever it is captured, a new one hatches from a hatchling (pawn) the next turn.&#10;&#10;Berzerker - moves like a Rook except that it can only move to capture. The Berzerker can move twice in one turn, capturing both times. It may capture friendly as well as opposing pieces.&#10;&#10;Teleporter - Can teleport to any empty space. It can also swap places with any friendly back-rank piece (i.e., not Hatchlings, Exploders or Guardians).  Can only capture one space orthagonally.&#10;&#10;Ranger - Can attack from a distance. This piece can attack diagonally from up to 4 squares away. It will capture the target piece and stay on the square it was in. If it needs to move, it can move diagonally up to 3 spaces, but cannot capture while moving. It can either capture or move, not both.&#10;&#10;Flier - Can fly over other pieces. It moves horizontally and vertically and can change direction any number of times (it cannot change directions back the way it came). However, since it must take off and land, it MUST fly exactly three spaces.&#10;&#10;Assassin - The Assassin is a sneaky piece. It can move diagonally up to three spaces and change directions any number of times (it cannot change directions back the way it came). It is excellent for getting around obstacles and is a very good mid-board piece since it covers a good area (especially when combined with the Flier).&#10;&#10;Marauder - This piece is like a Reflecting Bishop. It can move diagonally any number of squares and reflects off the side of the board. It can also move (without capturing ) one space horizontally or vertically to put itself on a different diagonal.&#10;&#10;Possessor - Can move 2 spaces in any direction, diagonally and/or orthagonally.  Instead of capturing a piece, it possesses an enemy piece and the possessor is removed.  It can also dispossess a possessed piece.&#10;&#10;Spectre - Moves like a Rook, but it can move through its own pieces (except the Leader and Guardian). A very good defensive piece.&#10;&#10;The following pieces are the front row pieces. They may not be possessed or teleport-swapped.&#10;&#10;Hatchlings - like Pawns in Chess, except they can move up to three spaces on their first move, not just two. Hatchlings are numbered from one to eight. The lowest-numbered Hatchling still on the board automatically hatches into a Wyrm when that side's Wyrm is captured.&#10;&#10;Guardian - The Guardian is the Leader's protector piece. It moves just like a Queen but cannot capture or be captured. Also, no piece can fly over it, through it, etc.&#10;&#10;Exploder - The Exploder is the Wyrm's protector piece. It moves on space in any direction (like the Leader) or it can explode. When it does so, it captures every adjacent piece (except Guardians) - including pieces on its own side! If it captures normally or it is captured, but the Exploder and the other piece are removed from the board.&#10;&#10;"

The elements appeared to conspire against the mortals and their heritage, bringing pain, hunger and destruction. And when the end of the human race seemed close at hand, an idea emerged amidst the deserted lands, and breathed hope into the surviving few. An idea of great power shimmering in a man about to fight for his own life. Thus began the era of the warrior; a warrior who, defiant to all, challenged heavens themselves. It was then that the wastelands saw the first Arenas, places endowed with mystic character, where the daring fought to death trying to single out the mightiest of them all. Some claimed that he was to win back gods&rsquo; favor; others that he was to become their equal and finally challenge even them. New habitats started to emerge around the Arenas, suddenly all vibrant with life and ruled, singlehandedly, by a Warlord, the best of the warriors. A Warlord sovereign, drawing passionate gaze of women and envious glances of men. A Warlord supreme, who thanks to his triumphs seemed to put humanity on a pedestal. A Warlord absolute, whose place could be taken by anybody willing to issue a challenge. The Warlord of the Arena.&#10;&#10;Warlord of the Arena (W&#197;&#130;adca Areny) is a tactical board game that simulates a duel of barbarian heroes.&#10;&#10;Players will create a unique warrior by distributing a number of points between six skills. Those skills will determine a warrior's agility, toughness, speed, sword mastery, etc. Warriors created this way will gain access to a vast armory. Various medieval weapons raging from daggers to heavy two handed axes await their test in battle. Throwing knives and crossbows, poisoned blades and big hunting dogs - all of this deadly weaponry varies in dealt damage, weight and special abilities, changing players' strategies for the fight. The strongest of warriors will be able to clad themselves in heavy plate armors, while the weaker ones will have to survive wearing only leather. Once warriors spent all of their gold, the players will build the arena. Even though the Arena is divided in several dangerous spaces, delivering special effects and fighting modification, players will be allowed to bring some extra mayhem to this place. Snakes, deadly spikes and a powerful chained beast wandering all over the arena are waiting to be bought for special points by the players to influence their tactics even further. Once the warriors and the arena are ready the duel begins. Each player can choose from arange of fighting moves (both defensive and offensive) to defeat his opponent. Chance of successful move attempt will be determined by your position on the arena, chosen weapon and position of your opponent. Lure your opponent out to the slippery floor and then jump him from behind to gain advantage ! Players will quickly exchange moves dancing in a sophisticated sword fight, using elements of the environment in order to win. There are 3 ways to win the duel. You can defeat your opponent by dealing one powerful blow which will kill him instantly or several minor ones that will cause him to bleed to his death! You may also poison him, which will cause them to lose consciousness and grant you victory. You can also try to deal a injury so painful that the opponent warrior will surrender, fearing for his life. All this brutal mayhem awaits you in Warlords of the Arena.&#10;&#10;"

The age group that we have suggested is 8 years and up, however younger children as young as 6 still can grasp the concept of the game. The game consist of 6 Noah figures, large playing board, 336 playing cards, 6 Ark pieces with card holders, 2 card trays and dice.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to collect as many animal pair cards from as many coloured regions in the time allocated. To start the game each player positions his Noah piece and Ark to correspond with the coloured starting icon on the board.  Each player then rolls the dice; the highest roll starts s first. As you move around the game board you will come across 3 different icons; 1. Coloured Region spots, 2. Rainbow spots and 3. Question mark spots.&#10;&#10;Landing on any 1 of 7 coloured region spots will entitle you to receive a corresponding coloured animal card. These animal cards consist of male, female and paired animals. Each colourfully illustrated animal card is unique to its region and comes with 3 descriptive facts and animal sound. When you pick up an animal card you must inform the rest of the players what the animal is without revealing its sex. These cards must be collected in pairs and placed in your Ark to be protected. Unpaired cards are placed face down in front of each player until such time the corresponding male or female card is collected.&#10;&#10;Rainbow spots are randomly placed around the playing board. Landing upon one of these icons allows the player to receive a Rainbow card. These cards can alter the course of the game in a very exciting way. This card set consists of good cards and not so good cards. The good cards can offer the player protection, extra animal cards and the chance to disadvantage your opponents. The not so good cards can damage your Ark and allow other players a chance to take your animal pairs which are no longer protected by a completed, undamaged Ark. Rainbow cards can dramatically change the outcome of any game in the dying minutes.&#10;&#10;Question mark spots allow the player to win other players animal cards by correctly guessing not only the animal card but the correct sex. Guessing correctly also entitles you to another turn. When you land on a question mark spot you can ask any other player 1 question. If you are having difficulty remembering who has what animal card you may chose to ask that player to read any 1 of 3 animal card facts on that card. Remembering other player&rsquo;s animal cards will definitely give you an advantage in game play.&#10;&#10;"

The credits can be applied in the team or teams the player chooses.&#10;&#10;To increase the confidence level of their teams and play in more times the dice to win games, each player must manage the trust claims as best they can. Thus, the CC can be invested in two types of resources: players and coaches. Both types are rated as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;outstanding&quot;.&#10;&#10;In all matches, the last dice roll made by a player is the one the counts for the final score of the match. For example, if you can throw the dice three times, but if you are satisfied with the 2nd roll, you don't need not make the final one. The latter roll is the one that counts, whether or not the most favorable.&#10;&#10;The &quot;home&quot; team may choose to re-roll the final dice of both players, by using the &quot;home factor&quot; card. Once rerolled the results are final.&#10;&#10;Each victory is worth 3 points and 4 CC, each tie is worth 1 point and 2 CC and every defeat is worth 0 points and cost one CC.&#10;&#10;This increase or decrease of confidence in players and /pr coaches and the gain or loss of CC are accounted at the end of a match day, and before the next match day.&#10;&#10;At the end of the group stage, only the two or four best teams from each group (depending on the number of players) advance to the next stage. The tie breakers are: &#10;1st: point gained;&#10;2nd: greatest goal average;&#10;3rd: most goals scored for.&#10;4th: result of the match between the tied teams.&#10;&#10;All other teams are eliminated from play at this point.&#10;&#10;For each stage a team advances, the controlling player receives 2 CC&#10;&#10;The quarter finals (if applicable),  the semi finals and final games are to be elimination games. If they end up tied, they go to penalties, using the &quot;penalty die&quot;. A series of five penalties for each team is rolled, and if the score is still tied, each team roll once until the tie breaks.&#10;&#10;The winner of the European football championship is the one whose team win the final of the competition!&#10;&#10;"

On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to the battle ground (jail).&#10;&#10;Fully customized game elements including:&#10;&#10;Custom Money: $1 Chen (from the new Pandaren race, featured in the soon-to-be released expansion, Mists of Pandaria)), $5 Magni (Dwarf), $10 Vol'Jin (Troll), $20 Tyrande (Night Elf), $50 Sylvanas (Blood Elf), $100 Varian ( Human), $500 Thrall (Orc)&#10;&#10;Custom Tokens: These top 6 tokens were voted on by fans: Corehound Pup, Murky, Doomhammer, Hearthstone, Mechagnome, Flight Path Boot&#10;&#10;"

126723,,"This is sort of an odd entry which fits with this odd game. In part this entry is to document that Scarnie was not a predecessor of Scarney. John Scarne used his name in many games in many variations. It makes trying to reconstruct his contributions to board games even more frustrating. Having never seen the game itself, I'll attempt to describe it from the rules. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be quite enough information to entirely reconstruct this game.&#10;&#10;To make matters a bit more confusing in his book The odds against me Scarne has a 1929 picture of him playing a game named Scarney with Jimmy Braddock. The picture shows a game which fits this Scarnie game for which the rules are available (see weblinks). Being a good promoter Scarne didn't show him opposing the water boy at the boxing camp, but the champ himself!&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;&#10;Scarnie is played on a board with four stations. Each station has the numbers 1 to 7 arranged in a semi-circle arranged in front of the player. There is common &quot;pool&quot; area in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;There are 28 men which we will say are black discs. There is a number on one side of the disc, with each disc having one of the numbers between 1 and 28. 20 numbers are say red, and eight are say green. (Sorry but rules don't specify color/number association!!).&#10;&#10;Play&#10;&#10;The men are place numbers down in the pool area, and then each player fills his stations consecutively (thereby selecting seven pawns total for the station) and keeping the numbers hidden from the other players. The dealer calls &quot;play&quot; and the men are turned over to reveal the numbers.&#10;&#10;The rules mention  &quot;Double&quot;, &quot;Triple&quot; , and &quot;Draw&quot; positions which I cannot explain. The available rules do describe other aspects of play. The gist is however that the pawns are eliminated from the board, and the last pawn left on the board scores points for that player.&#10;&#10;"

On each side of each die is one kind of animal, some small and some large. When you play dice, you need to either play a bigger animal than the player before you or you can play the same animal but in a higher number. Whenever you play an animal, you may use that animal's special ability, for example, to hinder your opponent or to help you get rid of your dice faster.&#10;&#10;"
