81225,,"From the rules book:&#10;&#10;Family kit contains five engaging games that combine U.S. geography with the math of numbers, data, logic, and strategy. The games are ideal for children 7 to 13 to play with parents, siblings, or friends. Children a little younger can play them with an adult or older child. The directions include ways to adjust the games to fit the age and experience of the players.&#10;&#10;Games included are: (1) Guess my state; (2) Take a trip; (3) Guess my rule; (4) Capture states; and (5) Closest match.&#10;&#10;(1) Guess my state - In this game, similar to &quot;Twenty Questions,&quot; players ask questions to try to identify a secret state that one player has chosen. At the start of the game, the state cards are laid out face up. Players take turns tryin to identify the secret state by asking yes-or-no questions (e.g., Did it become a state in the 1800s? Does your state border Canada?). After each question is answered, the states that have been ruled out are removed from the layout. The player who narrows the layout down to the secret state is the winner. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.&#10;&#10;(2) Take a trip - In this game, players navigate around the U.S. by finding states that border one another. At the start of the game, one state card is turned up. On the first turn, a player puts down a state card that borders it from their hand of 3 cards. The next player puts down a card that borders that state, and so on. For example, if Texas is turned up at the start of the game, on the first turn a player could put down Oklahoma, since it borders Texas. On the second turn, a player could put down Kansas, since it borders Oklahoma. The game is over when one player plays all of their cards or no more cards can be placed. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards. May also be played cooperatively with all players' cards face up.&#10;&#10;(3) Guess my rule - In this game,players try to discover a secret rule that one player is using to sort the states into two groups. For instance, a secret rule could be &quot;borders on an ocean.&quot; States that border an ocean would go in one group; states that do not border an ocean would go in the other group. the Rule Maker selects about six states form the layout ans sorts them into two groups according to the rule. Players take turns trying to figure out the rule by choosing a state that has not yet been sorted and saying which group they think it belongs in. After three turns in a row in which players sort states correctly, they may begin to guess the rule. The first player to guess the rule wins. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.&#10;&#10;(4) Capture states - In this game, similar to &quot;War,&quot;players compare the states according to a certain feature. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as year of statehood. On each round, all players put out a state card at the same time from their stack of face down cards. The player with the state that has the biggest number for the chosen feature (e.g., became a state most recently) captures all the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;(5) Closest match - In this game, players use math to find states that are most alike. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as number of libraries. In each round, they compare the states in their hand to a Goal state. For instance, if the Goal is Colorado, which has 253 libraries, they find the card in their hand of five cards that has closest to 253 libraries. They compare their chosen states, and the player with the closest of all takes the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10; - large map of U.S. for reference&#10; - 26 Blue fact cards, one for each of &#10;   the states in the Eastern U.S. &#10;   (sorry, no Washington, D.C.)&#10; - 24 Red fact cards, one for each of &#10;   the states in the Western U.S.&#10; - 10 Wild cards&#10; - 10 sample rules/question cards&#10;&#10;"

The game pieces are set-up in a traditional football formation, on a twenty-four square by ten square checkered football field board. The object of the game, like football, is to outscore the opponent. One player manages the offensive game pieces, trying to maneuver the quarterback towards the opponent&rsquo;s end zone for a score (touchdown or field goal). The other player manages the defensive game pieces, trying to capture the quarterback or prevent its advancement toward the goal line.&#10;&#10;Pieces are moved one at a time, similar to chess, beginning with the offensive team, then alternating to the defensive team. Each game piece is assigned a specific directional pattern of movement. Once a piece is captured it is removed from the game board. If the quarterback is captured, players switch roles, with the defensive team becoming the offensive team at the point of capture and vice versa. All pieces are returned to the board and play resumes.&#10;&#10;Scoring: A touchdown is seven points; a field goal is three points; a safety is two points.&#10;&#10;Game Timing: The game is played in two halves or four fifteen minute quarters.  Each coach is allowed three timeouts per half.&#10;&#10;Play timing: The offensive coach has thirty seconds to move a piece.  The defensive coach has fifteen seconds to make a responding move, which makes for a fast-paced and pressure packed game of strategic fun.&#10;&#10;This description is attributed to Cort Hubbard, the game designer.&#10;&#10;"

The rules and board are printed out from a PDF (the board and 10 pieces may be purchased from the game creator.) The board is a 5 wide by 6 tall illustrated grid of squares depicting the land the two sides are battling over. Each side has 5 colourfull rocket pieces each. 3 Rockets which can move 1 space forward back or sideways, 1 Pin which can move 1 space diagonal, and 1 Bomb which is stationary. These are arranged in 1-2 rows at opposite sides of the board. Each player chooses a &quot;home base&quot; and the objective is to either eliminate all of your opponent's pieces, or take and hold the enemy home base for 3 consecutive turns. Any piece can eliminate any other piece by attacking first. Both are removed if the Bomb is attacked.&#10;The game also comes with 4 different Modifier Cards, 2 of which are randomly dealt each player at the start of the game. At any you may play one of your cards to the board so that it covers any two spaces that you either occupy or are currently free. Each card effects pieces differently. Such as allowing the Rocket to move diagonally while on those two spaces.&#10;Additionally about 1 in 10 games are packed with a special Shifter piece that is randomly swapped for one of the other pieces.

Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects. We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn&rsquo;t know.

The game is easy to learn and provides a vivid atmosphere with lots of laughter.&#10;&#10;To prepare the game, a plastic disk is placed in the centre of the table and each player marks one of his hands &quot;true&quot; and the other &quot;false&quot; (or one can say that the right hand is &quot;true&quot; and the left hand is &quot;false&quot;).&#10;&#10;In a turn, a question is read out loud and all the players have to answer with &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as fast as possible, using their hands. For instance, if the answer is &quot;true&quot;, one places his right hand on the plastic disk, as such creating a pile of hands on top of the disk. Please mind that the answer to the question might vary as a function of the number of players, the players itself, etc (see below). Mind that once you've put your hand, you cannot change your answer anymore.&#10;&#10;Once all players have answered the question, i.e. have placed one of their hands on the pile of hands, scoring begins. The upper hand scores +1 point if its answer is correct or -1 point if its answer is incorrect. The second hand (from the top) will score +2 if its answer is correct or -2 if its answer is incorrect, and so on. For instance, in a 8 player game, the lower hand (on the plastic disk) scores +8 points for a correct answer or -8 points for an incorrect answer.&#10;&#10;Players really have to take risks to improve their score, answering quickly and so having their hand smashed.&#10;&#10;To give you an idea of the questions, there are several types:&#10;Concerning the reader of the question (I am a man)&#10;Concerning the player (You have a dog)&#10;Concerning the environment/location (We play in a bar)&#10;General questions (King Kong was an ape)&#10;&#10;The game ends as soon as a player has scored a specific number of points, e.g. 30 points in a 8 player game.&#10;&#10;Additional rules for some variations are included (like changing hands and playing in teams).&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by:&#10;&#10;    Hand aufs Herz&#10;&#10;&#10;"
