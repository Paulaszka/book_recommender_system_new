Commercial wargames first appeared in the late 1950s, although commercial miniatures and naval gaming date back to the end of the 19th century. Board wargaming had something of a golden age in the 1970s, before being replaced by fantasy role playing games (RPGs) and computer games in the 1980s. In the 1990s computer wargames were covered in glitz, simplified and made into a mass market product. Many of the 70s era grognards don't recognize these games as wargames, but they are. And simple, glitzy wargames are the future. Not entirely, of course, there is also developing a via web based market for lower budget, but more accurate and detailed historical wargames. We'll never get back to the 70s, but with wargames established as a permanent part of the commercial gaming landscape, we can expect an unending stream of new and innovative ideas.&quot;&#10;&#10;The first edition was published in 1980 by William Morrow.  The second edition was published in 1992, also by William Morrow (under various imprints, it appears).  &#10;The third edition (titled just &quot;Wargames Handbook&quot;) was published in 2000 by iUniverse.&#10;&#10;"

There have been four major campaigns, of which those of 1967 and 1973 - the so-called 'Six Days' and 'Yom Kippur' Wars - are of particular interest to wargamers as they involved the largest tank battles since World War 2. Israeli Centurions, Pattons and M-60s vie for battlefield supremacy with Arab T-54s and T-62s, and the arena has become a testing ground for new weapon systems and tactical doctrines while retaining an overall similarity to the armoured conflict of World War 2 which forms the subject matter of earlier books in this series.&#10;&#10;This book begins with an introduction to the subject, a short chapter on the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and a detailed description, with maps, of the 1967 and 1973 campaigns. There are two detailed chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured fighting vehicles and their characteristics, anti-tank missiles, conventional artillery, infantry weapons, tactical missiles, minefields and helicopters. There are also chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured organisation and tactics, and two specially commissioned sections on the war in the air by Mike Spick, author of Air Battles in Miniature. Finally, there are detailed playing rules, an appendix listing model suppliers, a technical glossary and an index, making this the ideal book for the increasing numbers of wargamers interested in this fascinating arena.&#10;&#10;"

This represents players&rsquo; movement along dark city streets and into and out of unlocked buildings.

Each book has been placed precisely in the pit, positioned according to exacting rituals; their function to prevent chaos from emerging from the pit. The Keeper is entrusted to stop the souls of the damned from escaping - something they attempt continuously - by touring the labyrinth and keeping the power contained in the books strong enough to seal the abyss. Only the Keeper knows the rituals and the exact position of every volume as he&rsquo;s the sole person with access to the Sator secrets.&#10;&#10;SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS is the seal that keeps the souls of the damned from flowing away...&#10;&#10;But the power of the old Keeper is waning, and the sinners&rsquo; pit has felt this, using the breath of the damned to slowly shift the volumes which compose the Sator across the labyrinth in order to open a passage for their souls into our world.&#10;&#10;Thus, the four Acolytes of the Keeper have been entrusted to recover the holy books that have been moved across the labyrinth. Each volume contains a key which lets one understand some of the arcane words of the Sator and thereby regain control of the labyrinth. The Acolyte who first recovers the four holy books that the Keeper has asked him to find will be able to access the Sator and become the new Keeper.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;&#10;Each player represents an Acolyte and tries to be the first to recover the four books that the Keeper has entrusted to him (the four books in the color of his pawn). &#10;The sinners&rsquo; pit is an intricate labyrinth of Footbridges and mobile walkways that can be moved by gears and pulleys. They can be turned and pushed in order to create a safe path over which the Acolyte may safely walk the abyss.&#10;&#10;To move Footbridges, each Acolyte may read from the book Incertus Movet in Aere Sospeso', which is a kind of user&rsquo;s manual explaining how to manipulate the walking passages to meet his needs. The more Footbridges the Acolyte moves during his turn, the farther he will be able to walk.&#10;What&rsquo;s more, he will be able to use the content of his own Liber Fidei, a set of prayers, thoughts and ascetic books, to perform apparently impossible actions (such as the manipulation of time and space) thanks to the power of his faith...&#10;&#10;"

In addition the central mountain fields are provided with numbers between 1 and 3.&#10;&#10;Each player has several small temple buildings and with the help of Oracle stones (small wood disks) they indicate how far they want to pull their own temples in a round.&#10;The goal is to place as much as possible own buildings on the temple mountain. With 2 players one must place 7 buildings in order to win (there are 13 spaces). With 3-4 players one must achieve at least 12 points to be the winner. Each round is divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;In the first phase each player decides the number of steps that he wants to move one of his building. Accordingly it takes and puts as many Oracle stones into its right hand, while keeping the remaining Oracle stones covered in the left hand. Every player place a bet on the total amount of Oracle stones that will be played in the current round by all players (it's not permitted to call a number already called by a previous player). After each player called a value, everyone open their right hand, and if someone called the exact value, he will have benefits in the third phase.&#10;&#10;In the second phase every player moves one of his buildings (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) according to number of Oracle stones played. During the movement one can jump over one or more buildings, but the target field must be however free. If one jumps over an opponent building with the next to last point of movement, he can strike this at the end of its movement, if he wants to. The building is then put again into the supply of the opponent.&#10;&#10;In the third phase only the player that called exactly the value in the first phase can place one of its temple on a free starting position on the board. If all starting positions are occupied or if the player has already all temples on the board, the action is not taken.&#10;&#10;"

When the board is complete, the player whose pawns access the most territory triumphs.&#10;&#10;In Towers the board starts off full size but shrinks as players race to construct towers before bearing them off the board to earn points. It is tempting to try for the high-scoring tall or single-color towers but if you take too long or allow your towers to become isolated, your opponent may end the game before you are ready to score.&#10;&#10;Conveyor is a strategic race game in which the object is to move pawns across the board, starting from your seating position. Each turn players also have an opportunity to alter the pattern of light and dark tiles by shifting a row or column. Players strive to be first to move all their pawns across the shifting landscape of the board.&#10;&#10;Each of the three games presents different challenges and satisfactions lasting 30 to 60 minutes, and the unique tile distributions each time insure that no two games are ever the same. The Tapestry set includes 26 light-stained tiles, 26 dark-stained tiles, 8 red pawns, 8 yellow pawns, 4 white pawns, 4 black pawns, a cloth bag, and a rule booklet.

The player who manages to get all of his game figures into his own star corner first wins the game.  A blockade figure constantly changes the aspect of the game.&#10;&#10;Piggy Back - The object of the game is to get all the figures across the board first, whereby the players are forced at times to carry the opponent's figures &quot;piggy-back&quot; across the board or even to be carried in the same way themselves in order to reach their destination.  The point of the game is to try to take advantage of the piggy back rule whenever possible.&#10;&#10;Fox Jumping - A gathering of foxes (2 or 4 fox families make 40 foxes) is disturbed by a hunting party.  Hastily each fox tried to hide in one of the 39 neighboring dens.  But since there is room for one fox in each den, the slowest fox loses the race.&#10;&#10;Surakarta - This game originated in Indonesia.   It bears the name of the old time-honored city of Surakarta on the island of Middle Java.  The game is played on a grid of points with all points on the outer edge connected by a curved line that leads back to another board edge.  The idea is to move your pawns around the grid trying to get to a curved line that can be used to move to another side of the board and more importantly eliminate your opponents pawn.  The game is played actively in Indonesia by drawing lines in the ground and playing with pebbles.&#10;&#10;"
