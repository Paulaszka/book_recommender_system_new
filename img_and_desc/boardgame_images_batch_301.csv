The player rolls all five dice on his or her first roll, trying to produce a 6. If on the first roll the player gets a 6, the player sets that die aside and scores any fish thrown as part of his or her catch. The player then rolls the remaining four dice two additional times, trying to increase his or her catch of fish.&#10;&#10;Each turn is played the same. A player must get a 6 before scoring the catch of fish. If a player does not roll a 6 during his or her three rolls per turn, the player cannot score fish on that turn, and passes the dice.&#10;&#10;The player catching the most fish after each player has had three turns, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Contains: 5 green fish dice &#10; instructions&#10;&#10;"

Magnetic traffic lights change like magic at any of 100 intersections.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play.  In the first a card is drawn and the first person to get their car to the location first wins that card.  Another card is then drawn and play continues in this fashion until all 18 cards have been collected.  The winner is the person with the most cards.  The alternate way to play is the Cross Town game.  The cards are not used in this one and the winner is first player to cross town by hitting the fewest red lights.&#10;&#10;Magnets are placed in the plastic base according to the instructions and then the game board is placed on the base.  As the players car moves on the board the magnet in the bubble in the car may flip from red to green depending on the magnetic action caused by the base.&#10;&#10;

Instead, players builds their own word puzzles in front of them. Letters are worth points (vowels are worth 1 point, consonants 2 points, and super consonants J, K, Qu, X, and Z, are worth 4) the object of the game is to be the first player to reach 500 points. Every player randomly selects eight tiles and places them face down. Simultaneously, players turn them over and begin building the puzzles with as many letters from their individual pile as possible. Once someone has used up all eight tiles, he or she says &quot;Saygo&quot; and all players will select another tile. If nobody can use their tiles it is a stalemate, and everyone selects another tile. Should players find they can not use all of their tiles, they have the option of rearranging their puzzles as often as needed, in attempt to use all letters. The game continues until all tiles are used and the last person to use his/her last tile yells &quot;done&quot;. Once the group verifies the accuracy of the winning player's words, the winner collects the remaining letters and adds them to his/her score. Once a player has 500 points (that number can be lowered or raised if desired), the round is finished and players can play again.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Until not many decades ago, in every valley you could find someone who said they had seen the Salvan&egrave;l, even though actually encountering him was extremely unlikely.&#10;They described him as a small man, boyish-looking, and always with some red feature on him: a hat, clothes or hair.&#10;&#10;This time the Salvan&egrave;l, running to and fro, has left his magical tracks everywhere. Anyone who treads on them by mistake is bound to get lost - and after much wandering, finds himself back where he started. Now you are lost in the wood too!&#10;To get back home you must make three good moves to reconstruct a path that will take you out of the wood. But the goblin will also help you, if you meet him!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of every turn, the guide picks a colored card. This card has two effects:&#10;1-The Salvan&egrave;l immediately moves toward the border indicated by the card, and if he meets a player... He immediately gains an extra turn!&#10;2-The player indicated by the card plays his turn... And if he meets the Salvan&egrave;l... He plays again!&#10;&#10;In every turn, players can use one of these moves:&#10;1-Spin:choose a tile and rotate it in any direction you like&#10;2-Puff of Wind: move one or more tiles of a horizontal or vertical line&#10;3-Jump: move your token from the tile where it is to another one next to it.&#10;&#10;The first player who jumps out of any tile on the side of his colour wins!&#10;&#10;"
