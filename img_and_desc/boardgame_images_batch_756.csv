Each player uses a deck containing 50 cards. Before the game begins the players agree on a set number of VP (Victory Points) needed to win the game, the rule book suggesting 5 VP being the standard amount to win. Much like many other card games the game can also be won if the player's opponent cannot draw any more cards from their deck.&#10;&#10;Players prepare their 50 card deck before the game and once prepared and turn order established, begin the game.

They are built in much the same way as Mission cards are played but do not provide VP. If the player succeeds in building the Facilities card they played, they gain the bonus granted by that card. If the opposing player wins, however, the Facilities card is considered to have been destroyed and no bonus is granted to either player. Character cards are used to either attack mission cards to earn the VP or to either build or destroy facilities depending on who played the Facilities card.&#10;&#10;Play continues in this manner, with control passing between each player at the end of each turn until one player meets one of the victory conditions listed above.&#10;&#10;"

In turn order, every player play an instrument card on the board, choose an instrument and place its note discs on the choosen instrument. Each instrument plays a fixed number of notes and has two kind of abilities: an ability always-on, and another that is activated only if the instrument is placed in the proper location for its acoustics.&#10;&#10;2) During the  Symphony Phase, the so arranged orchestra plays the music score, which is modular, and therefore different in each game. The orchestra is divided into 5 columns, and each column plays in a specific part of the score (for example, column A plays in the first 2 bars, column B in the second, third and fourth, and so on). When a column of instruments has finished its notes, the next column plays, and so on. Within a column, the lower instrument start playing a note, then the instrument immediately above plays a note, and so on, upward. Once at the top, the lower instrument plays again, and so on, until all the notes of the column are played. Obviously the player who has their note disks on the instrument controls is it, and decide where to place the related disks to score VPs. In this way, the game is not subdivided in player tyrns, but rather into instrument turns.&#10;&#10;The main aim is to play better than their opponents (= score more VPs), so it is not important to play many notes, but play them properly. First, each note provides VPs according to the Voice that is placed on (1-3 VPs). Secondly, there are extra VPs for the Sheet note majorities (at the completiion of each sheet) and Voice note majorities (at the end of game). Also, different areas or notes on the music score are Scoring Areas, and grant you to advance on corresponding Scoring Tracks to score extra PV at the end of the game. Finally, some notes, as well as the placement of the initial instruments, provide yous Bonuses, that can be placed on your instruments (max 1 for Instrument) to potentiate their effects. So, to play better in such melodious context requires a careful strategy and good tactics.&#10;&#10;Type: Eurogame&#10;Target: soft gamers (Base mod.) / hard gamers (Advanced mod.)&#10;Modalities: Basic and Advanced&#10;&#10;&#10;Porta la tua compagnia sul palco, e fonditi con le altre, a formare un'Orchestra!&#10;Drafta gli strumenti migliori a disposizione in ogni partita, piazzali nella posizione ideale per la loro acustica, ed infine suona ... la Sinfonia (cos&igrave; da totalizzare pi&ugrave; Punti Vittoria)!&#10;Ogni strumento suona in un modo diverso, ogni Spartito &egrave; diverso, ogni partita sublime!&#10;&#10;Ogni partita a Symphony &eacute; divisa in 2 Fasi: la Fase Orchestra e la Fase Sonata.&#10;&#10;1) Durante la fase Orchestra, l'Orchestra viene formata disponendo le carte Strumento, ed i giocatori, gradualmente, prendono possesso degli Strumenti che preferiscono, piazzando, a turno i propri dischi nota, sullo Strumento che scelgono. Ogni Strumento suona un numero prefissato di note e dispone di due abilit&agrave;: una sempre attiva, e l'altra che &egrave; attiva solo se lo Strumento &egrave; piazzato opportunamente, in una posizione appropriata per la sua acustica.&#10;&#10;2) durante la fase Suonata, l'Orchestra cos&igrave; formata suona sullo Spartito, che &egrave; modulare, e quindi diverso in ogni partita. L'Orchestra &egrave; divisa in colonne, e ciascuna colonna, suona in una parte specifica dello spartito (ad esempio, la colonna A suona nelle prime 2 battute). Quando una colonna di Strumenti ha terminato le proprie note, suona la colonna successiva, e cos&igrave; via. All'interno di una colonna, suona prima una nota lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, poi una nota quello subito sopra, e cos&igrave; via, a salire. Arrivati in cima, riparte lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, e cos&igrave; via, fino ad esaurire le note della Colonna. Chiaramente il giocatore che ha i propri dischi su uno Strumento, lo controlla, e decide dove piazzare le relative note per ottenere i PV. In questo modo il gioco non ha una normale suddivisione di turni dei giocatori, quanto piuttosto una suddivisione in turni degli Strumenti.&#10;&#10;Dato che lo scopo &egrave; suonare meglio dei propri avversari (ovvero realizzare pi&ugrave; PV), non &egrave; importante suonare tante note, ma suonarle opportunamente. Innanzitutto ogni nota fornisce PV in base alla Voce su cui &egrave; piazzata. Secondariamente, vi sono dei PV extra per le maggioranze di Foglio (al termine di ogni Foglio) e di Voce (a fine partita). Inoltre, diverse aree dello Spartito sono Aree Punteggio, che fanno avanzare su appositi Tracciati Punteggio e forniscono PV extra a fine partita. Infine, alcune note, cos&igrave; come il piazzamento degli Strumenti iniziali, forniscono dei bonus Musicista, che possono essere piazzati sui propri Strumenti (max 1 per Strumento) per potenziarne gli effetti. A causa di tutto ci&ograve;, prevalere in un simile contesto melodioso richiede un'attenta strategia ed una buona tattica.&#10;&#10;Tipologia: Tedesco                                               Target: soft gamers (mod.

It is hinged on one side, and when opens, creates an extended lithographed playing field. The bottom of the box has a ramp starting at the hinge, and five scoring slots on the far side (worth 10, 20 and 50 points).&#10;&#10;Players take turns shooting marbles from the top end, over the ski jump and (hopefully) into one of the scoring slots. Player with the highest total score for six marbles wins.&#10;&#10;This game was produced by the German publisher Klee, but the box says &quot;Made in Bavaria&quot; and bears the company's early &quot;Clover&quot; international logo (Klee is German for Clover). While undated, this certainly means it was published after Moritz Bromeisl joined the company in 1915 and began moving it into international markets, and probably between the end of WWI and the early 1920s.&#10;&#10;"

The solid wood board shows a circle with 4 concentric rings divided by 10 radii. There is a centre space marked with a Crown, and each of the 41 resulting spaces has a hole into which a wooden peg can be placed. There is a hole in the side of the board stopped with a cork in which 20 pegs are stored.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10 pegs, placed in the outer two rings of half the circle. The pegs start with a plain side up, and are marked with the player's colour (red or black) on the other end.&#10;&#10;Players move alternately, either clockwise, counter-clockwise or toward the centre. As in normal checkers, they must jump over an opponent into a vacant space if able to do so. A piece moving or jumping into the Crown space at the centre flips into a King, which is then allowed to move and jump outward as well as inward. A piece in the Crown space is safe, and only a King can jump back into the Crown space and continue jumping.&#10;&#10;Normally, a player wins be eliminating the opponent's pieces, but there also are rules for a &quot;losing&quot; game where the objective is to give away all your pieces or create a situation where you are unable to move.&#10;&#10;While the rules show the publisher as London Novelty and Display Products, the box says it was manufactured by Robinson Industrial - Crafts Limited, also of London, Canada.&#10;&#10;"

There are three types of cards: 18 Reporter cards (2 each of an English, French and German reporter with corresponding camera and transport cards); 18 Story cards (color-coded red, blue and orange, each with 2 Event cards, 2 Place cards and 2 Interviewee cards); and 18 Document cards (red, blue and orange, each numbered 1-6).&#10;&#10;Players collect combinations of sets, each of which can be a Reporter with matching equipment, the Event, Place and Interviewee of a color, or three consecutive Document cards of the same color.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 2,700 in tokens and a hand of 8 cards, and each turn draws a card and discards a card. The other players in turn order have an opportunity to buy the discard if they can use it to complete a set of three, paying 20 into the pot if they do so. Other players may overbid if eligible, paying 40, 60, etc. If the discard is not claimed, play passes to the left; if it is claimed, play passes to the claimer's left.&#10;&#10;A hand is won when a player completes his hand with one of 7 combinations of sets. The winner takes the pot plus a score that varies with the difficulty of the combination, from 500 for two series of Reporters and one of Stories to 5,000 for three series of different Reporters. Winner of the game is first to 20,000 points.&#10;&#10;The game box features celebrated French journalist Georges de Caunes. The artwork suggests it dates to the 1960s.&#10;&#10;"
