As a first year Arcana student, your final exam is to create a functional spell scroll.

The player rolls a die to navigate the grid, selecting letters and copying them on a separate, blank grid. Points are scored for each completed word, chosen out of a word bank. The words in the bank are classified as either &quot;aspects,&quot; &quot;elements,&quot; or &quot;methods,&quot; and combining them -- having one word use letters from another -- is the way to score big points.&#10;&#10;After there's no space left on the grid to inscribe more letters, the game ends, and points are tallied. A grading rubric tells the player whether they've passed the test... or failed, and need to take it again.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the April 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;"

Whalers at the end of their hunt voyage toward a nearby lighthouse. The waters darken. It is Halloween night. Upon the Mast a strange shape in the waves is spotted. Is it Whale? Or perhaps an innocent shipwrecked sailor in need of help? The Captain considers the tone of the voice, there is certainly something more haunting within the call, a fear. A shark? A tidal wave?

Unlike games that tend to aim for a perfect balance, Sea Evil's main focus is delivering the terrifying experience that occurred on this Halloween night. Characters and situations are not balanced to equal one another but created to simulate the actual experience as it happened. The game begins with a whaling ship on the sea waters, Evil begins to unfold each turn adding greater potential to destroy the Whalers. Through sea navigation and harpoon hunting skills the whalers can possibly reach the shining rays of a coastal lighthouse. THE WITCH RETURNS! DARKNESS DESCENDS UPON THE WATERS!&#10;&#10;Sea Evil is a tactical hex and counter game with each token representing an individual character. Characters have sheets with some individual stats related to speed, strength and will to live. The Whalers can win if they can navigate themselves to the Lighthouse or slay the Sea Witch. Evil triumphs if it can destroy the Whalers in the waters.&#10;&#10;Sea Evil, and Halloween Nightmares Horrorgame Magazine are a very visceral experience and we have rated it X. Anyone one under the age of 18 is NOT permitted to play. Pregnant or players with a fragile or nervous disposition are strongly encouraged NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Back when the land was not ruled by kings and queens, neither structured armies with bishops, knights and rooks existed. The world was unexplored and amorphous and it had not been squeezed yet into the rigid cast of the contemporary chessboard. There were just 2 proud tribes constantly struggling to expand their territories to ensure survival in a barren and harsh land. And those who today we (somewhat degradingly) call &quot;pawns,&quot; were free entities with dreams, fears and hopes who defined their own destiny.&#10;&#10;The game is played with 32 light- (&lsquo;white&rsquo;) and 32 dark-colored (&lsquo;black&rsquo;) square tiles and 8 light- (&lsquo;white&rsquo;) and 8 dark-colored (&lsquo;black&rsquo;) pawns.&#10;&#10;Update: Anarchess has now been playtested and confirmed to also be highly playable and fun with 3 and 4 players. In a 3-player game each player gets 6 pawns, while in a 4-player game each player gets 5 pawns.&#10;&#10;It takes just 5-10 minutes to learn how to play. A game lasts about 30-60 minutes.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player can perform 2 actions:&#10;A. Tile Placement&#10;B. (Optional) Pawn Action (placing a new pawn, moving or attacking)&#10;&#10;The game ends after a player places the last available tile. Players earn points by controlling areas (i.e., having the most pawns in them) comprising two or more tiles.
