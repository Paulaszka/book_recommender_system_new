Grow your trading company by commissioning new ships and direct your fleets to win monopolies on key trade routes and harbors in a race to be recognized as the Queen&rsquo;s Royal Trading Company! &#10;&nbsp;&#10;SUMMARY: &#10;Fortune &amp; Folly is a worker management game with a rich nautical theme and very approachable rules. Event cards are drawn each turn and serve the dual purpose of normalizing game length and driving strategies that become more complex as players get more comfortable with the ecosystem at work in the game&rsquo;s mechanics. But getting into the adventure is easy. You start with three ships and move them between harbors and routes to score points based on the price of the goods moved over that route. Winning harbors allows you to place more ships and grow your fleet. When the last event card is resolved, the player with the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:&#10;Players start with a fleet of three ships on the board and can grow their fleet to ten by commanding monopolies on the harbor islands. Use trade ships to claim trade routes and gain Fortune points and direct pirates to harry your enemy company's efforts. Players will plan and then take each step of their turn with the help of their turn order card which includes a step to choose a world event card. Three of these events are shown next to the deck, so you'll have three shown options during this phase, or you can choose the top card of the deck at random. Once there are too few event cards to replenish the four options, the current player takes their turn and game is scored. Whoever has the most Fortune wins!&#10;&#10;Each turn you will:&nbsp;&#10;1) Draw and resolve a card&#10;2) Move a ship to a route or harbor island sharing a way point&nbsp;&#10;3/4) Optionally, you may get to make additional moves, or move pirate ships around&#10;5) Score points for routes you monopolize&nbsp;&#10;6) Place new ships for each harbor island you monopolize&#10;&#10;ATTRIBUTES:&#10;There are four dice, but they are used as counters for commodity prices.&nbsp;&#10;There are always the same number of turns because of the number of World Event cards and there's a mechanic called the Royal Court card that is used to speed up games that start to run a little longer due to players' deliberating more over their turns.  &nbsp;&#10;The World Event cards present the only real randomness in the game, but you'll always have four options (including the option to pick a card at random).&nbsp;&#10;A strategy guide is included in the rule book, so you can really hit the ground running.&#10;&#10;Designer Notes:&#10;This game is meant to be super easy to get learn, even for those just getting into the hobby, but to introduce layers as you become familiar with the mechanics. &#10;You'll be carefully planning your move and thinking like a shrewd trade company manager in no time! &#10;This game was developed over the course of almost two decades and we're so proud of how it turned out. Many thanks to Erwin Arozza for his contribution of stunning artwork that we think really brings the rich nautical, sometimes piratey, theme to life. We hope you'll have as much fun playing fortune &amp; Folly as we do!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The curse accumulated in the land is summoning further calamities, and many tourist attractions are turning into haunted spots whirling with malice.

When a player plays a character, the other players usually have to follow with the same race, if they have one. The higher ranked characters beat the lower ranked ones. This means: The chief beats everyone from the warden to the dork, the warden beats everyone from the sorceress to the dork and so on. If a player does not have a card of the first played race, he has to play one of the dominating race. If the player does not have a card of the dominating race either, he needs to send another race into the fight.

The goal is to escape an alien planet before the food supply runs out. Your actions are guided by a hidden agenda given to you at the beginning of the game. Pushing your agenda earns you points, but push too hard and players may turn on you. Everyone shares a potentially hazardous food supply that your awful teammates might try to sabotage. End each turn by drawing from the Event Deck in the hopes of acquiring fuel. The more fuel you have the better. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;1) Pick a dealer. Whoever ate bacon last is a great choice. Dealer, read carefully.&#10;&#10;2) Organize the cards into decks based on the colored borders on the backs of the cards.&#10;3) Shuffle these decks and place them in the center area of play.&#10;&#10;4) Organize the Tag Cards by character. Let each player pick a character to play with or decide for them. It's up to you, almighty dealer. Players take their Tag Cards and keep them nearby.&#10;&#10;5) Deal each player one Hidden Agenda Card. These cards will determine how you play the game. Only you can look at this card. Place this card next to your tag cards so you can reference it.&#10;&#10;6) Deal everyone a hand of four cards from the Action Deck. Players can look at these cards.&#10;&#10;7) Pass the Event Deck around twice. Each player selects a Food Card from the deck, safe or unsafe, and places it in any stash. (Example: There should be 8 food on the table for a four player game)&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;&#10;The player left of the dealer goes first.&#10;&#10;There are three stages in a turn: Draw, Action, and Event.&#10;&#10;1) Draw: Draw from the Action Deck until you have four cards in your hand. Don't draw if you already have four cards.(Example: If you are holding one card, then draw three)&#10;&#10;2) Action: Play as many cards as you like and/or discard as many cards as you like.&#10;&#10;3) Event: End your turn by drawing two cards from the Event Deck. Choose the one you want and place the other card on the bottom of the deck. If you chose a Fuel Card, place it next to your player tags. If you chose a Food Card place it in anyone's stash. (Don't let anyone else see this card) If you chose a Hunger Card, show it to everyone, and eat the required amount of food from your stash.&#10;&#10;Play continues clockwise around the table.&#10;&#10;Player Stash: Every player has a personal stash in front of them to store Food Cards. It holds up to three Food Cards.&#10;&#10;Using Food Cards: Hungry and Starving Cards will instruct you to use one or two Food Cards, respectively. To do so, first select a Food Card from your Player Stash and have every player acknowledge your selection. Then reveal the Food Card. If it is safe you live to see another round. If it is unsafe you are now in Quarantine. (Continue reading to learn about Quarantine) If there is a shortage of Food Cards available to you, you have died of starvation.&#10;&#10;Quarantine: If you eat a contaminated food, you are now in Quarantine. You lose all food in your stash and can no longer add any food to the table. (We can't have you contaminating everything) You continue to play as normal. You can continue to collect fuel, but you still have to eat. If you draw two food cards, you must place both in the discard pile. Unfortunately for you, you can not leave the planet while under quarantine. To get out of Quarantine, place a pair of Fuel Cards in the discard pile.&#10;&#10;Inspecting Food: During your Action Stage, play an Inspect Card. Select an untagged Food Card, privately view it, and return it face down. Place one of your Tag Cards on the Food Card as safe or unsafe. You can lie your pants off.&#10;&#10;Fuel: Fuel is required to launch the escape pod. Whoever plays a Launch Card can select goes with them, but there has to be enough total fuel between you to meet the required amount. Each player can hold up to a maximum of five fuel. Fuel is also a bargaining device. You can barter fuel with others to get yourself out of a jam. You also have the option to give a player one fuel to eat any one food from their stash. Fuel is also how you get out of Quarantine, by discarding two fuel.&#10;&#10;You Lied: If it's ever revealed you incorrectly labeled a Food Card (even a Food Card you used), you must discard your hand immediately.&#10;&#10;You Died: If a player dies by starvation, they no longer get a turn, but can still win if they accumulate enough points at the end. Their hand is placed on the Action Deck along with the discard pile and the deck is reshuffled. Without looking at the Food Cards in their Player Stash, place them on top of the Event Deck along with the discard pile, any Fuel Cards they had, and then the deck is reshuffled. Any food they tagged remains in play.&#10;&#10;Ending the Game: For the game to end, one of two things needs to happen: either a Launch Card is successfully played or everyone has died. A Launch Card can be played at any time as long as the required amount of fuel is met.&#10;&#10;Survivors get a point for each Fuel Card they contributed to the launch. Then all Hidden Agenda Cards are revealed and the points are tallied. Whoever acquired the most points wins! In the event of a tie, whoever played the Launch Card wins. If everyone died and there is still a tie, who ever died last wins.&#10;&#10;Special Cases:&#10;&#10;If you use all five of your Tag Cards, you cannot inspect anymore food until a Tag Card is returned to you.&#10;If you draw two Fuel Cards and you already have five Fuel Cards, discard both and draw again.&#10;If you draw two Food Cards and all stashes are already full, discard both and draw again.&#10;&#10;TEAM GAME RULES:&#10;&#10;If you have four or more players, you have the option to play in teams. Comrades vs Rogues. Your team affiliation will be stated on your Hidden Agenda card. You still cannot show other players your Hidden Agenda card. Your points will be added to your teams total at the end of the game and whichever team has the most points wins. The teams do not need to be of equal size.&#10;&#10;"

The 10,000 are Greek mercenaries who have come to fight for Cyrus, the younger brother of the Persian King Artaxerxes. Cyrus is killed in battle against the King leaving the Greeks abandoned, deep in hostile territory. The Greeks begin a long march northward to the Black Sea and Greek territory. The player whose pawn reaches the sea first and with the most men is the winner.&#10;&#10;There are 2 Tracks: &#10;&#10;     The Distance Track. This track has 60 numbered spaces. The first space is that of Cunaxa where Cyrus was killed. The last space is the Coastal Greek Colony of Trapezus. Each player has his own uniquely coloured pawn which he moves along &#10;&#10;&#10;the distance Track. Each space represents about 10 Miles.&#10;&#10;The Time Track&#10;&#10;     This track has 60 numbered spaces. A single neutral pawn is moved a single space after all players have completed a single turn. When a player reaches the sea he should take his coloured pawn from the distance track and place it on the time track on the current space to mark how long his journey took.  Each space represents about 2 days. &#10;&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 10,000 men. Men are lost during the journey due to fighting, exposure, starvation, and desertion. Paper and pencil to keep track of your manpower total.&#10;&#10;Each Food Token represents 1 days supply worth of food for the Army. Lack of Food Tokens will result in accumulation of Starvation Tokens. Mutiny Tokens represent dissent and despondency amongst the ranks. Anger Tokens represent the accumulation of barbarian forces arrayed against you.&#10;&#10;Players share an action deck. Most cards will increase or reduce the value of a target die-roll. Most improve your rolls. Others will be to the detriment of your opponent.&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 16 Phases: &#10;&#10;     Draw Phase - The current player draws 3 cards. &#10;     Route Phase - Roll against the Route Table.  The result will generate modifiers for one or more of the forage, travel and battle rolls. &#10;     Weather Phase &ndash; Roll against the Weather Table. The weather conditions will generate modifiers for the forage and travel rolls&#10;     Satrap Phase &ndash; Roll against the Satrap table to determine whether you encounter a Satrap.&#10;     Negotiations Phase - If you encountered a Satrap this turn make a negotiation roll. This will result in gaining Anger or Food tokens.&#10;     Attack Phase - Make an Attack Roll. If your result is equal to or less than the number of AT you have, you are attacked by Barbarians. &#10;     Battle Phase - If you are attacked by Barbarians remove 1 Anger Token and make a battle roll to determine the number of casualties.&#10;     Exposure Phase - If the weather was harsh this turn make an exposure roll and lose men accordingly.&#10;     Forage Phase - You may choose not to forage, if so skip this turn. Otherwise make a roll against the forage table to gain a combination of food and anger tokens&#10;     Consumption Phase - If you currently have a food token, discard all your starvation tokens. Discard 1 food token. If you have no food tokens to lose gain 1 starvation token. &#10;     Starvation Phase - If you have Starvation Tokens make a roll to determine the number of men lost.&#10;     Morale Phase &ndash; Roll on morale table to determine whether you gain a mutiny token.&#10;     Rally Phase - If you have mutiny tokens make a rally roll to see whether you can remove any of them.&#10;     Desertion Phase - If you have mutiny tokens make a desertion roll to see whether any men desert. &#10;     Travel Phase - Make a travel roll to determine how far your pawn advances on the distance map. This roll will be modified by weather and route markers and other activities undertaken during the turn.&#10;     End Phase - Max hand size is 7 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when all players have finally reached the last space on the Distance Track.

The family game Quatro Flash is one of these.&#10;&#10;The game rules are pretty simple, and the objective of &quot;four in a row&quot; sounds very familiar. There are actually a great many two-player games based on this principle. As a family game, though, this idea is amazingly new, suspenseful, and witty.&#10;&#10;Players proceed in turn. Each player places a disk of their color on the board. The object of the game is to arrange four of your disks in an uninterrupted row, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They can be lined up on the same level, stacked on top of one another, or staggered as a stair-cased row.&#10;&#10;You need to follow the course of the game very attentively if you are to spot early enough a player's potential chances of winning and try to prevent this with one of your pieces.&#10;&#10;The temptation is great to disclose a player's possible chances and urge the other players to intervene, but this is not allowed. Creative conversation, however, cannot be prohibited completely.&#10;&#10;"

They will also need to supply 4 six-sided dice and a pencil.&#10;&#10;Your mission in each adventure is to locate and defeat the six enemies that dwell within the realm. Players roll four dice and must assign each of them to one of the four places on the adventure sheet (Movement, Enemies, Treasures, and Locations).&#10;&#10;MAP &ndash; One die must be used to explore the map. Each side of the die allows the player to shade in a certain shape of hexes on the map. When a number is shaded in in front of location, the player may attempt to battle the enemy there and secure the treasure that resides there.&#10;&#10;ENEMY &ndash; One die is also used to increase the power of an enemy. You must choose to either make the enemy have more health or deal more damage. So as the game progresses your foes will gain in power, so you need to balance how powerful you want them to get with how big the treasure horde is there.&#10;&#10;TREASURE &ndash; Another die is used to increase the size of a treasure horde by shading in the next square in the corresponding treasure. All sorts of helpful items can be had including swords, shields, and potions, but sometimes moving down the treasure track will add obstacles like traps or locks.&#10;&#10;LOCATION- The fourth and final die is used to increase the power level of a location. This both increases the amount of gold there and the power of the enemy. Whenever a star is shaded in on the location tracker you must shade in a box on the enemy residing there.

Our witches are vegetarian and real!&#10;&#10;Legend says that in a lagoon of Cern&eacute;gula, a town in Burgos, a coven of witches had their meetings. In The Witches of Cern&eacute;gula, you must become the witch who cooks the best and most potions. Collect the required herbs, but these are not always available, so think well about your actions! Cook in your cauldron elaborate recipes and master one or more magic arts. Become the most experienced witch and earn points to prove it!&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game consists of several rounds divided into two phases:&#10;&#10;&bull; Herb collection: In order to collect herbs, move your cauldron located inside your herb board, so that the ladle, the carrot leaves, and the snake head point to the herbs you want to collect. The players must take all the corresponding tokens according to the placement of their cauldrons, but they cannot store more than three green tokens per type of herb. If you had to place more than three green tokens on an herb, place red tokens from the common supply instead. Each red token near the board equals 2 negative points at the end of the game. The red tokens are permanent: they are still red even if the player has fewer than three green tokens on the herb.&#10;&#10;&bull; Potions preparation: During this optional phase, you can prepare one or more available potions as either complete or incomplete potions. In addition, once you have made the potion, you can perform the ability immediately or in another time, as the card indicates.&#10;&#10;Using potions' abilities costs victory points. After using the ability of a potion card, turn it 90&ordm; to indicate it's been used. At the end of the game, the value of turned potions cards is subtracted from your victory points.&#10;&#10;"
