There are two cards that instruct you as to how this might be done, and suggesting that it should be to scale (5 yards to the inch).&#10;The other 52 cards relate to moving your ball towards your opponent's goal (whilst he is trying to do the same to you). It is only a card game so no equipment is provided (as in the pitch mentioned earlier and the designer suggests you use buttons for the ball).&#10;The object is to be the first to score 4 goals. Scoring a goal usually refers to a move card being played that crosses the goal-line.&#10;Every card has a Kevin Keegan football tip on it.&#10;The box clearly states that the game is for 2 to 6 players, but the rules only suggest up to 4 players. Either way, it is really a 2 player game.&#10;&#10;"

The publisher is a large organization that sells frozen food, so all the 20 different ingredients are things they would like to sell to you, so not every meal collected will be as healthy as the Green example (lots of chips and burgers!).&#10;The Wild Cards are All Change (all players pass their hand to the player on their left), Lose Hand (a player has to discard his hand and start collecting again), Wild (can represent any ingredient card) and Go Shopping (you can draw one card from any player you choose).&#10;&#10;"

The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&#10;&#10;"

Redakai cards have Blast 3D technology, making them appear 3D, as well as making attacks appear to animate as the player moves the card.&#10;&#10;In Redakai, a player is trying to eliminate the character(s) controlled by the opponent to win the game. In the basic game, each player starts with one character and on a turn you draw a card from your deck, then play it immediately. The card types are monster &ndash; which are played on your own character to boost defenses and heal damage &ndash; and attack &ndash; which are played on the opponent's character. A character can have defenses in three colors &ndash; green, red, blue &ndash; and if an attack is stronger than a character's defense in that attack's color, then the attack hits and damages the character.&#10;&#10;The cards are transparent and they stack on top of each other during play. A character's health is represented by three damage zones on the card, and if all these zones turn red (by playing one or more attacks on that character), then the character is eliminated. An attack can also cover up and remove a character's defense, while monsters can boost defenses and cover red damage zones with yellow ones, thus healing the character.&#10;&#10;In the advance game, each player controls three characters and starts with a hand of three cards and a maximum Kairu value of three. Each turn, a player boosts his maximum Kairu by one (to a maximum of 20), draws one card, then (optionally) plays monster and attack cards, spending Kairu to do so equal to the cost on each card. Some cards have &quot;react&quot; abilities that allow you to spend Kairu to defend against attacks. At the start of each turn, your Kairu refreshes to its maximum value.&#10;&#10;If you eliminate all three of your opponent's characters, you win the game. If you cannot draw a card on your turn because your deck is exhausted, you lose.&#10;&#10;"

Game play is similar to that of Poker. The deck consists of 56 cards:&#10;&#10;&#10;     52 Pyramid cards (divided into 4 suits - red, green, black, brown)&#10;     4 Cylon cards (similar to Jokers)&#10;&#10;&#10;The value of the cards are determined by a symbol system of dots, lines, and triangles (pyramids). One dot has the value of 1 and one line has the value of 5. The highest value of the dot line cards is 13, with the pyramid card out ranking that. However a pyramid card can also rank low in a sequence of cards, much like an Ace can in standard playing cards.&#10;&#10;Sequence examples:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10 (much like Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10)&#10;     5, 4, 3, 2, Pyramid (much like 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace)&#10;&#10;&#10;Cylon cards are used as wild cards, and can be played one of two ways. The card can either be a stand in for which ever card the player wants it to be OR it can be the Cap Stone to created a Full Pyramid, which is the highest possible winning hand in the game.&#10;&#10;Players are dealt initially 5 cards in Pyramid. The cards are dealt out like in Poker, one at a time around the table, beginning with the player to the dealer's left.&#10;&#10;Once the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left bets first and places their bet into the pot. Then the dealer will ask if anyone would like new cards and how many they want. Players can discard up to 4 cards.&#10;&#10;After the new cards are dealt, each player can either surrender (discard and sit out the hand), call (match the pot), or raise (match the pot and raise it). If a player decides to raise, every other player must match this raise in order to stay in the game or surrender.&#10;&#10;The following is the rank of winning Pyramid hands:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Full Pyramid - Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Cylon&#10;     Kobol - Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10&#10;     Colony - 5 cards in sequence AND of the same color&#10;     Quorum - 5 cards in sequence of any color&#10;     Quad - 4 cards of the same rank, one of each color&#10;     Triad - 3 of a kind&#10;     Duo - a pair&#10;&#10;&#10;If more than one player has matching hand types, then the hand that has the highest card wins out. For example two players have a Quorum. One player has 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and the other player has 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. The second player, the one with the 8, beats the hand of the first player.&#10;&#10;Much like Poker, Pyramid is a game of bets and bluffs. The goal is to win the most money in the end. Use your wits and your best Pyramid face to win all the Cubits!&#10;&#10;"

Play takes place on a large square grid with areas designated as guerrilla camps, plantations, mass demonstrations, etc. Players roll dice and move their pieces and pieces representing resistance movement members in order to occupy the various areas; occupying an area provides a benefit depending on the type.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a 24-page booklet containing the rules, historical background, &quot;news&quot; items and military tactics for use during the game. In addition, there are cardstock sheets bound in to the booklet. These are cut apart to create the role cards and cards depicting the various board areas. The players have to supply the board, dice, pawns, and resistance movement markers.&#10;&#10;The game is designed for 13 players (one of whom runs the game and one of whom is in charge of the news), but can be played with more or fewer by doubling up players or roles. No specific minimum or maximum numbers are given.&#10;&#10;"

They are all illustrated with characters from a specific country and they consist of, for example, Mr America, Miss America (both in colour) and a Mr America and a Miss America (not in colour). The object is to win tricks by the pairing of two cards relating to the same country. The pairs maybe a wedding pair, a pair of spinsters or a pair of bachelors. Each pair has a value in points. A 'Society' Wedding (the two coloured cards of a country scores 5 points. A 'Quiet' Wedding (The two non-coloured cards of a country or one with colour and one without) scores 3 points. A Pair of Spinsters or Pair of Bachelors (from the same country) scores 1 point. If you can collect all four cards from a country, you can score bonus points; Two Society Wedding Pairs 15 points; Two Wedding Pairs - no Society Wedding 10 points; Pair of Spinsters and a Pair of Bachelors 6 points.&#10;The game play is interesting. Players draw a card and place it to start to form rows of cards face-up. Five such cards are permitted in a row. If two cards from the same country 'touch' each other (vertically, horizentally or diagonal) then that pair is taken by the player. If a pair is taken the remaining cards are moved to the left of their row. If a card reaches the left end of a row and needs to be moved it is added to the right end of the row above.&#10;Play several hands and the first player to reach 100 points is the winner.&#10;A solitaire variant is also reccomended in the rules.&#10;Undated but it was probably in Austerity Britain in the 1950's (The rules say that there are only limited numbers of the game available, due to quota restrictions).&#10;&#10;"

Strategy, deception, and bravery will be your most valuable assets in the complex and varied game of Kamakura.&#10;&#10;The game features original artwork and game play.  The premise of the game is to capture all of your opponents territories OR gain a score of 17 or more. You combine various soldiers each with unique abilities with crafty weapons in order to take territories as your own. The mechanics behind the game are card management and general strategy.&#10;&#10;As of 2014 edition:&#10;&#10;Gameplay;&#10;We&rsquo;ve decided to introduce &ldquo;Clan Power&rdquo; cards. Each deck comes with 1 Clan Power card for each Clan, totaling 4 Clan Power cards per deck. Each Clan Power is unique, adding new strategic elements and depth. &#10;To compensate for adding the new Clan Power cards we took away 1 Naginata and 1 Yumi (the two most powerful weapons). The deck now totals 54 cards. &#10;Color coded backs have been added for easy sorting with their corresponding Clans.&#10;&#10;Updated Territories;&#10;Barrages and Walls now have point values. 1 barrage (Attack Power of 2) can take either the Farm or Village, but 2 barrages (total Attack Power of 4) are needed to take a Fortress or Palace. Walls now have a Defense Power of 2.&#10;Walls also have the ability to scout territories. For example, 1 Barrage can be played on a palace, if your opponent doesn&rsquo;t have a wall, they must still reveal the Territory, but it cannot be captured.&#10;Even though the Barrage now has an Attack Power, it still may NOT be used with a soldier.&#10;&#10;Refined Card UI;&#10;Along with enhanced card and box quality we wanted to address the card design and how they explained themselves. We rethought how to phrase the descriptions and abilities of every single card. This led us to add slight iconography to the cards to further help explain the context that each card may be used in. At the top right of the Abilities box is either a sword, shield, flag or a combination of sword and shield.&#10;&#10;For more info on the 2014 edition refer to the updates section of the Kickstarter for the 2011 edition.&#10;&#10;"
