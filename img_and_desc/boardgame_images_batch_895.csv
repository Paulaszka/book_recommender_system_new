Most of the core mechanisms are identical to Pax Pamir, though some have been tweaked to fit more appropriately to the Expanse setting.&#10;&#10;In the game, 3-4 players act as powerful puppetmasters acting behind the scenes of the Solar System, manipulating the three main factions to their own advantage: The United Nations, the Mars Congressional Republic and the Outer Planets Alliance.  All while mysterious events are occurring due to the arrival of the extraterrestrial Protomolecule.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is mostly in the form of area control.  However, each area of the board can be controlled in two different ways (often simultaneously): a faction can control a region by having the most fleets and transports there, whereas a player can control a region by having the most supporters and fleets of a faction they are loyal to present.  Four scoring phases occur throughout the course of the game, and the method of scoring is determined by whether any one of the three factions is in dominance when the scoring occurs.  If so, then players loyal to the dominant faction will score victory points.  If not, then players score victory points based on their individual power and presence on the board.&#10;&#10;Players can increase their power and abilities by purchasing asset cards from a communal market using influence, the game's currency.  Each asset grants its controller particular actions and abilities, and at any particular time one of the four types of cards - Military, Subterfuge, Political or Economic - will be able to perform their actions for free based on the current political climate.&#10;&#10;Players must acquire the most powerful assets, ally themselves with the ascendant factions, and make deals with other players to secure their positions on the board and score the most victory points when the scoring phases occur.

Winning hands look a lot like poker hands.&#10;&#10;The real beauty of NUTSO are the wild cards. When played they can take down the strongest hand or turn a losing hand into a winner. Then again if you play one it might ruin your chances of winning. Who knows? That's why this game is called NUTSO.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Warriors are removed from a column through a strategic mix of attacks and invocations.&#10;&#10;Players take turns, with each turn consisting of four actions. The player may chose from a list of five possible actions, which can be played in any number and order up to a total of four. The actions are as follows:&#10;&#10;1) Draw: The player draws three cards from their deck.&#10;2) Deploy: The player places a warrior into their battle column. The warrior may be a single card or multiple cards of the same type. Warriors made of multiple cards are stronger.&#10;3) Attack: A ready warrior at the front of your column attacks the warrior at the front of your opponent's column.&#10;4) Strengthen: Cards of the same type can be added to a warrior.&#10;5) Invoke: Place a card from your hand into the discard pile to activate the invocation power on a card.

After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans &mdash; whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.&#10;&#10;In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.&#10;&#10;Azul: Summer Pavilion lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.&#10;&#10;After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.&#10;&#10;If you completely surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players take turns placing a card in one of the trays on the board.

Jokers may be played anywhere at any time.&#10;&#10;When a player completes a row-column combination by filling the last empty tray of a row or column, the player places one of their &quot;dot makers&quot; in the cell of the 3x3 grid corresponding to the row and column combination they have just completed.

The princess of the kingdom of Painan will pay a state visit the very next week, and the king has ordered the magicians to lay out gardens by then. The one who creates the most beautiful garden will be given a reward, but you are running short on time. You've put your heads together and came up with this idea: How about you create a section of a garden, then use a magic mirror to fill up the rest?&#10;&#10;This plan seems like it will work, but can you beat the other competitors and win the glory?&#10;&#10;To play Mirror Garden, you reveal a garden card from the top of the deck, then place it on the table. All players rush to make the garden shown on the card by using a foldable mirror and two semicircular garden boards. Use the boards to create a portion of the garden, then set the mirror to fill up the rest of the garden. Once your garden is complete, call out the code written on the boards. If correct, you claim that garden card.&#10;&#10;Whoever scores five points first wins!&#10;&#10;"

In the War phase they get enough turns to move each unit once. Victory is achieved when you destroy all your opponent's units, get over 1000 Faith, or by having the most Faith at the end of four rounds.&#10;&#10;Playing Units and Objects is free, but when units are destroyed they give Faith to your opponent, making stronger units riskier. Actions give you an immediate advantage but cost Faith, so getting the timing of everything right is of critical importance.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Realms are represented by customizable dice with faces that can be popped out and upgraded for better ones.&#10;&#10;Each game is different as during setup, players draw five tiles (from a bag of 35) to determine which extra die faces will be available beyond the five standard lines of faces: lands (victory points), farming (grain), commerce (coins), settlements (defense), and progress (upgrades). Each player begins with two identical dice and can gain more dice during play, in addition to upgrading their starting dice.&#10;&#10;Play is mostly simultaneous. To begin, players roll their dice, with one player rolling the Fate die, which affects all players.&#10;&#10;If Winter appears on the Fate die, players must pay 1 grain for each die they own or take a -2 point &quot;misery&quot; chip for each grain they lack. Players may then re-roll one die for free and use any re-roll or &quot;set-a-die&quot; tokens (that allow you to choose the die face result) that they have previously invested in for further control.&#10;&#10;Players then resolve any attacks showing, starting with the Fate die and then clockwise, with each player's attack affecting all their rivals. Each shield showing on your dice lets you ignore one attack. Successful attacks can cost players grain, the use of a die for a turn, or even the loss of a die face (which can be later rebuilt).&#10;&#10;Players collect any victory points (VPs), grain, and coins shown on their die faces. Coins are used to acquire upgrades, purchase re-roll and set-a-die tokens, repair destroyed die faces, or buy a new die -- which also costs 2 grain -- expanding their realm. At most 1 coin can be saved in your treasury from round to round.&#10;&#10;Upgrades are the heart of the game. Players receive upgrades from upgrade symbols showing or by spending coins. Die faces have 1, 2, or 4 dots on them. To change from a 1 to a 4 in the same color &mdash; such as from a yellow face collecting 2 grain to the 4-dot version that collects 4 grain and 2 coins &mdash; costs three upgrades, whereas changing from one face to a different color face at the same level costs just one upgrade.&#10;&#10;Using upgrades, crossgrades, and the &quot;free reroll&quot; each turn, players can craft their dice to specialize them and dramatically &quot;tilt&quot; the probability that a desired face is rolled. Of course, players will want different things at different times: upgrades to get going; coins to expand their realms; food if a string of harsh winters are rolled; defense against that pesky Robber on the Fate die; VP chips to race for victory; or whatever die face is the key to winning a particular setup.&#10;&#10;If during a round any player needs to use a 10 VP token, a -10 misery token, or a 10 grain token (because all of the smaller value tokens have been used), then the game ends after finishing that round; otherwise, the player with the Fate die passes it clockwise to the next player and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;When the game ends, players tally their points earned, both from VP chips and improved die faces, with 2-dot faces being worth 1 VP and 4-dot faces being worth 2 VP. Whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;"
