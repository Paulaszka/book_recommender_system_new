Players roll the dice to move their pewter pieces around the board, and draw cards that tell them to pay or collect cash. As players move around the board, they pay for taxidermy work, bows and arrows, and firearms, and collect money from winning big-buck contests. If players land on a piece of property they don't own, they must pay to hunt.&#10;&#10;"

If the player has the fruit asked for, he must give it up, unless he has the guard of that fruit; for example, if one player asks another for an apple which he has, if he also holds the dog, he may refuse, saying, &quot;My apples are guarded by my dog.&quot;&#10;&#10;You continue calling for fruit until you call on a person who either doesn't have any or has the guard for that set. Once stopped, all players draw 2 cards from the player to their left. Guards cannot be called away, but since they are frequently passed, their location is often doubtful.

The cards have questions on one side of increasing difficulty, answering each of which correctly scores points (more points for harder questions). The difficulty progression is different on each card, so one card may have three easy, one medium and one hard question; while another may have two, two and one.&#10;&#10;If a player cannot answer a question, the card has four multiple choice possibilities on the reverse for each question. Taking this option halves the points for a correct answer. Correctly answering allows you to keep being asked questions and scoring from the same card. A wrong answer has the card discarded and play passes to the next person.&#10;&#10;The game has no given end conditions; either a fixed number of rounds or a time limit seem reasonable. Most points at the end wins.&#10;&#10;"
