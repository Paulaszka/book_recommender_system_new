Dinosaurs still roam the Earth &amp; magic actually works! A sub-species of early Humans called Neuro-Evolutionary Rostral Developers (abbreviated as N.E.R.D.s) has recently evolved, &amp; N.E.R.D.s have been busy inventing all sorts of amazing &ldquo;cavepunk&rdquo; stuff.&#10;&#10;One of their most popular inventions is the downhill racer, popularly known as the Whee in Cave-Speak. Many different styles of Whees have been invented, &amp; the N.E.R.D.s who invent them almost always claim their design is the best.&#10;&#10;A bunch of prehistoric Clans have gotten together to test these claims. The Great Whee Race is about to begin! Each player chooses a Whee Racer, &amp; then purchases a Crew &amp; Cavepunk inventions. The racers then vie to be the first to cross the finish line in a race down a big hill. And just about anything goes in The Great Whee Race, so you&rsquo;ll have to outmaneuver, outfight, &amp; outwit your opponents in order to win!&#10;&#10;The Great Whee Race is played on a track overlaid with a square grid. From 2 to 5 racers vie to make it to the finish line first. Each racer - called a Whee in Cave-Speak - is controlled by 1 player (or team of players), A variety of prehistoric-ish species serve as crew members, &amp; give various bonuses. Whees can be outfitted with melee weapons, missile weapons, or both, as well as cavepunk inventions.&#10;&#10;Once the downhill journey begins, a simple card-based simultaneous movement &amp; action system is used so that players don&rsquo;t know where anyone else is going when they choose their movement. This has 2 nice effects: players are all active throughout most of each turn, &amp; perhaps more importantly, there are usually LOTS of collisions.&#10;&#10;A unique &ldquo;game mechanic&rdquo; is used to resolve all actions: the Rok Draw. Every time they attempt an action or have a contest with another player, a player draws from a pool of tokens consisting of 3 kinds of Roks. Bonuses &amp; penalties add to or subtract from the number of Roks drawn. Most actions have the same target for success, so they are resolved quickly. Players can use 1 of 6 pre-made Whees &amp; crew, or can customize their own using a simple point build system. There&rsquo;s another PDF included with track sections, templates, Whee Racer stat cards &amp; models, &amp; all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need.&#10;&#10;"

Two cards says &quot;Again&quot; and repeat the action programmed in the previous slot; one card says &quot;Energy&quot; and gives a energy cube which you can use to buy options.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Since each player has their own deck, the cards no longer have priority numbers to determine who moves first. Now movement order is determined by whoever is closest to a transmitter on the game board.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    When players are damaged, they no longer receive one less card for each damage (or have one of their program registers locked) at the start of a round; instead they receive damage cards that will be shuffled into their decks. &quot;Normal&quot; damage from the board or a robot laser gives you &quot;spam&quot; damage. When you program one of these cards, you remove it from play at the appropriate time and replace it in the register with the top card from your deck. Surprise! Other types of damage exist, with a Trojan horse granting you two spam, a virus infecting nearby players, and a worm forcing you to reboot, which gives you even more damage. By playing the damage, though, you remove it from your deck.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

At first all of us were excited, because a silly string store was opening in town, and Sour John&rsquo;s dad was handing out free samples to all the kids in the mall.  We had a blast!  But the spoiled brat &ldquo;Sour John&rdquo;, as we would later come to call him, wasn&rsquo;t satisfied.  He wanted to rule the entire mall, and eventually all of Little Worth.  Sour John was a child genius, and he soon opened his own weapon store, &ldquo;More Gore!&rdquo;, in the mall.  This is where he conducted his late night experiments to perfect a can of silly string that would be unbreakable, unending, AND impossible to resist.  One night he went to the fountain in the greenery section of the mall, &ldquo;Fount Bloom&rdquo;, and discovered that Fount Bloom&rsquo;s special mixture was exactly what was needed to craft his most diabolical creation &ndash; &ldquo;ONE STRING TO RULE THE MALL!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Fortunately for us all, he misplaced The One String before he was able to wield it.  It was found by a good kid, nick-named &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo;, but it quickly corrupted him.  He started using The One String as deodorant and calling it &ldquo;my freshness&rdquo;.  (Yeah, it was weird.)  Seagull took up with the wrong kids, the &ldquo;Redheads&rdquo;, and later changed his name to &ldquo;Gold Thumb&rdquo; (based on his newfound obsession with the James Bond movie &ldquo;Goldfinger&rdquo;).  But again, as fate would have it, &ldquo;Billy Bob&rdquo; Braggin found The One String in Gold Thumb&rsquo;s discarded lunchbox, and he kept it safe for a while.  Most recently he just gifted it to his younger cousin, &ldquo;Fro-Gro&rdquo; Braggin.  But Sour John has just discovered that the Braggin family is in possession of The One String.

They have decided that Yellow Ship will undertake the dangerous task of taking The One String all the way (downstairs) to Fount Bloom, the only place where it can be dissolved forever.  Meanwhile, Lean &amp; Green will serve as a distraction to keep the Redheads and the Nostrils away from The One String.  Secrecy is of the utmost importance.

Numerous French efforts to dislodge them failed and the two great hosts stared at each other from their respective trenches. German General Erich von Falkenhayn and French Marshal Joseph Joffre realized that there was much open, exploitable territory to the north of these solidified lines and each prepared to maneuver around the flanks of his opponent. These mutual and simultaneous flanking moves resulted in a series of headlong battles that gradually shifted the forces north toward the French Channel coast. These maneuverings yielded a series of encounter battles at Picardy, Albert, Artois, La Bassee and along the Yser River. But these engagements were ultimately indecisive and the campaign&rsquo;s final stage was set for the dramatic clash at the end of the &ldquo;race&rdquo;, at the ancient textile city of Ypres. &#10;The &ldquo;Race to the Sea&rdquo; campaign was the last mobile campaign on the western front of the First World War &ndash; a last chance for victory. It was a final push to get &ldquo;home before the leaves fall&rdquo;. But the resulting murderous battles &ndash; culminating in the infamous &ldquo;Kindermord von Ypern&rdquo; (the Massacre of the Innocents at Ypres) &ndash; were so bloody and indecisive that their effects instead directly lead to the creation of the Western Front trench lines and to a continuation of a  war that seemed would never end.&#10;&#10;The game system is based on the same system used in the game Dead Reckoning by Tiny Battle Publishing. There are no dice, no CRT's, no lists of modifiers and no combat factors. A card-based combat resolution and initiative bidding system drives the action, along with a random event table that provides variety, WWI theme and campaign-specific events.&#10;&#10;The game includes:&#10;&#10;One 12&quot; x 18&quot; map&#10;88 counters&#10;36 cards (12 Initiative and 24 Combat Results)&#10;&#10;"

It covers the campaigns of spring and autumn 1800 that took place in Germany from the crossing of the Rhine to the banks of the Inn. General Moreau, whose successes would later be overshadowed by those of Napoleon in Italy and the improbable victory of Marengo, is at the heart of this initiative. In six months, he manages to force back Kray&rsquo;s and then the Archduke John&rsquo;s Austrians from France&rsquo;s doorstep to the confines of Bavaria with the culminating decisive battle at Hohenlinden.&#10;The three first scenarios describe Moreau&rsquo;s entrance into the campaign with the hazardous crossing of the Rhine, the gruelling march through the Black Forest, the concentration of the three army corps from Sainte Suzanne, Saint Cyr and the army reserve coinciding with the flank assault from Lecourbe&rsquo;s corps, the counterattack of the Austrians under Kray, and the undecided battles of Engen, Mol&szlig;kirch and Biberach. The French must demonstrate their resourcefulness as Napoleon grows impatient and demands reinforcements from Moreau to support his offensive in Italy. Time is running out; advance in the direction of Ulm before the order arrives for the troops to depart toward the south.&#10;The three scenarios that follow relate the events in Bavaria that lead up to the clash at Hohenlinden in deplorable weather. The Archduke John, propelled by his ardour, decides to assault the French at Munich while the latter marched toward them. This battle of encounter is decisive, contrary to the battles of the spring. With this victory, Moreau succeeds in bringing to an end this war with Austria.&#10;With this new volume, the series The Marshals continues to evolve. The experience of playing numerous games as well as the requests of fans of the series led to minor adaptations integrated into the general rules as well as the addition of new optional rules.

Created to captivate children in an era of increasingly short attention spans, the TorahLine game provides engaging gameplay to help kids absorb stories, facts, and the chronology of the Torah.  The first game in the TorahLine series, Exodus from Egypt &ndash; Shemos, Va&rsquo;eira and Bo, depicts the riveting events from the book of Exodus.&#10;&#10;Packed with 90 colorful cards and providing hours of fun for ages six and up, TorahLine: Exodus from Egypt covers the events in the first three Torah portions from the enslavement in Egypt to the 10 plagues to the first Passover to the eventual freedom from Egypt.&#10;&#10;The front of each card has an event title, a hand-drawn illustration, and verse text. The back includes the Torah portion and chapter and verse numbers. At the start of the game, players are dealt starting events on which to build their line of cards in sequence. Players then take turns drawing cards from the pile and correctly (or incorrectly) placing them in line in order by chapter and verse. After all the cards are gone, the player with the most correct cards in his or her line wins.&#10;&#10;The game makes it easy to adjust the difficulty for each player, making it ideal for older children and families. It also comes with a bonus trivia game that can be played in the car or at the dinner table.&#10;&#10;"

Create the ultimate deck by collecting your favorite skater's cards to link together the highest scoring run.&#10;&#10;As an EXTRA BONUS you can collect inserted collector cards of your favorite skaters.&quot;&#10;&#10;Games are played in a series of rounds, or &quot;heats.&quot; Each player creates &quot;lines&quot; or strings of tricks of increasing point value, attempting to score as many points as possible.  If a player can't play all of the cards in their hand, they risk dropping out of a heat early while their opponents continue to build lines.  Once all players have dropped out of the heat, each player scores points equal to the highest value line they've built in that heat.  Play continues over multiple heats, with the high score after an agreed-upon number of heats winning the game.&#10;&#10;Available in 5 different 42-card starter decks, or 9-card booster packs.&#10;&#10;"

To set-up the game, remove three face-down cards from the deck of 45 cards from the game, then lay out two cards face up to start a line. Each round, each player receives five cards in hand, and each turn you either play one card from your hand to the end of the line or &mdash; once per round &mdash; collect the most recently played five cards. Once all the cards from hand have been played, deal out five cards to each player and start the next round. After four rounds, the game ends.&#10;&#10;Some cards have positive or negative numbers on them, and you score those points directly. Other cards are numbered 5-8, and you score 5-8 points for a value if you have more of those cards than the other player. Additionally, you score 5 points for each set of 5-8 that you've collected. And while normally points decide who wins, if you collect all three special cards &mdash; each of which are worthless on their own &mdash; you win immediately.&#10;&#10;The original edition saw players seeking the Holy Grail, with the assistance of various factions. Nasza Ksi&#196;&#153;garnia's version of the game &mdash; Fabryka czekolady &mdash; features the same gameplay as the original design, with players are fighting over chocolates.
