Each tile (except 3 extra-tiles showing a rose) shows one of the numbers from 1 to 7. They are available in four player colours and 7 times as white. The white ones are the general supply, forming three stacks, so the three top tiles are available. Each player has the tiles of his own colour as a &quot;personal supply&quot;.&#10;Gameplay: On a player`s turn, he can choose either a white top tile or a tile from his personal supply and place it adjacent to any tile(s) already placed on the table. It is allowed to place any white tile adjacent to any other tile, but coloured tiles must not be adjacent to other coloured ones. Aim of the game is to create as many &quot;perfect Rosettas&quot; as possible: groups of seven tiles, with a tile of your colour as the centre and 6 white tiles with the other six numbers surrounding it, which is 10 points worth in the final score. If one or more tiles of 7 tiles show the same number, the &quot;doubles&quot; are subtracted from the 10 points. Rose-tiles are &quot;jokers&quot; and stand for any number a scoring player wants.&#10;The game ends, when all tiles are placed, or all coloured tiles are surrounded.&#10;&#10;"

They each then turn over two cards that are in different columns.&#10;&#10;The goal of Nines is to have the fewest points at game end by getting columns with matching cards (e.g. three 4's in one column). Matching cards in a column essentially &quot;cancels out&quot; that column and the total value of those three cards is zero.&#10;&#10;After all cards are dealt, a single card is flipped over from the top of the draw pile. Starting to the left of dealer, a player's turn consists of drawing a single card either from the discard pile or the draw deck. If the player takes a card from the draw deck, they may look at it and either discard it or replace one of the cards in their current play area (can replace either face up or face down). If they choose to replace a card, they have to discard the one they replaced. Taking a card from the discard pile means they have to replace one of their cards, and then discard the one they replaced.&#10;&#10;The game end is triggered when one person has all of their cards turned face up. Then, every other person gets one more turn. On this final turn, players do get the option of turning one of their own cards over.&#10;&#10;After the game is over, the players turn over any face down cards. If a face down card matches the face up cards in its column, that column of cards counts as zero points. All points are then tallied.&#10;&#10;The cards all have different values. Jokers are worth negative three points, aces and kings are both worth zero points, jacks and queens are ten points each, and the numbered cards have point values equal to the number on the card.&#10;&#10;"

Materials: black and white laminated board featuring a course and cartoon graphics, spinner (you can use a 6 sided die, 34 bonus tabs, 7 cutout figures for bunch and riders, 6 rider cards (Bernard, Eddy, Fausto, Jacques, Sean, Tom - functionally identical). &#10;Riders can be either in &quot;the bunch&quot; or making a break out in front or left behind. When in the bunch the rider figure remains on your card where you also place bonus tabs that are accumulated by reaching certain points in the race first and also when rolling on your turn a 4 or 5 if in the bunch, or 6. Main mechanism is roll and move along a track that includes squares for gaining bonus tabs and penalties that can move you back. The race takes the riders past fans, through an avalanche, past a protest, into a thunderstorm, up the Kremmelburg climb, across cobbles and up the Poggio climb before the finish. Each turn, each player spins the spinner (rolls the die), moves individually or stays in the bunch and and after all players the bunch moves. The bunch always moves three spaces. To break away from the bunch you must roll a 4 or more. A minimum of one rider must remain in the bunch. Generally there can only be up to 2 riders per square (1 on the Kobbleburg climb) and the bunch will swallow you back up if it catches you or leave you off the back if it passes you. Players use their bonus tabs to increase their movement rate or to increase the speed of the bunch when the bunch moves.&#10;The strategy revolves around collecting bonus tabs and deciding when and at which part of the course to make an individual break. The winner is the first rider past the finishing post.&#10;&#10;"

The Shores native embarked on the conquest of this continent to exploit its resources, including the &quot;Loom&quot;, and trace routes of exploration.&#10; To this end they created guilds, companies specialized in adventurous war, politics, knowledge and &quot;loom&quot;, led by the Guild Masters .&#10;Today, competition is raging on the continent and guilds vie for profit from lands unknown.&#10;&#10;Every player is a master of Guild. The goal is to double his personal treasure of 10 Guilders (game currency), that is to say, come to possess 20 Guilders in his personal treasure.&#10;There are 6 houses, so there are 6 types of different basic games (one per house), each player choosing one of the houses to play.&#10;Early in the game, each player has 15 guilders: 10 in his personal treasure and 5 in the bank.&#10;&#10;There are several types of cards:&#10;1. Territories (Land and premises)&#10;These maps provide resources: The Loom (magic), War, Politics and Knowledge. Each card provides 1 or 2 resources, each being either red or green, or white (neutral). Resources are used to bring into play other cards.&#10;2. The Auguries&#10;These are cards that are played at the beginning of the round (during the Winter phase) They have an effect that extends to all Guild Masters. These are external events.&#10;3.

The combat system has both players rolling dice in each combat.&#10;&#10;In this two player game each player starts the campaign game and 1914 scenario with cards that also represent the prewar stocks of ammunition, reserves and planning that allows the war to start off with a large bang. After players expend this allotment of cards, they must purchase more cards along with new units. Each player's resources are limited, so players often will not be able to launch large offensives every turn. They'll need to husband their resources. This represents the preparation for the next &quot;Big Push.&quot; All of this leads to difficult game decisions all the way through the game.&#10;&#10;There are scenarios for each year of the war from 1914 to 1917, along with a hypothetical 1918 scenario.

If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.&#10;&#10;In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&#10;&#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.&#10;    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.&#10;    Visit the opera and spend $2.&#10;    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.&#10;    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.&#10;&#10;If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.&#10;&#10;"

In 1895, exploring Amazonia, Auguste Copperpot discovered a gate to a lost valley, occupied by a primitive civilisation. Wiraqocha Valley was the name he gave to this remote Eden. This world enclosed a treasure that was going to revolutionize modern sciences, namely the Somnium, an orange luminescent crystal showing amazing properties. It can be used as fuel, affects matter and even time. Immediately, this virgin land became a new Eldorado for European colonists. Empress Victoria II decided to send several conglomerates to share this promised land and reap the fruits to her benefit.

In his turn, each player rolls some six-sided dice, combining them to take possession of territories, or to protect from the opponents the ones he already owns. Every hexagon affords resources or special capacities, which are means to influence die results to fit one&rsquo;s strategy. There are three ways to win: bring back a huge cargo of Somnium to the Empress; acquire enough scientific knowledge to build the Leviathan, a terrifying weapon serving the Kingdom; or find in the temple depths the four relics that will allow you to reach Wiraqocha&rsquo;s treasure.&#10;&#10;"

To win you must use your resources wisely to construct 12 victory points worth of buildings along the Shale River which runs through the different quarters of the City of Iron.&#10;&#10;Needed to play: the deck of 34 cards and 35 markers per player in 2 colors.&#10;&#10;Setup: Place the 4 Quarter Cards comprising the map of the Shale River between players.&#10;&#10;The 4 quarters of the city each have 6 buildings on them that can be constructed by players. Each building is worth 1 victory point towards the goal of 12. Further, each building allows players to use the special power of that quarter of the city to place more workers, distribute resources or purchase cards in the game.&#10;&#10;Next each player takes a set of the 5 Industry Cards: Foundry, Trade Guild, Civil Service, Builders and Shipwrights and places them below their side of the river.&#10;&#10;Industry Cards are used to construct the buildings along the river by placing resources on the 5 icons on each card. Once enough resources have been accrued, players may construct one of the buildings, though each industry type only constructs one or two particular types of building based on which Quarter Cards the industries are adjacent to.&#10;&#10;Next each player takes a set of the 4 Resource Cards: Brick Kiln, Textile Mill, Lumbermill and Smelter. Players shuffle these cards and randomly lay them out below the Industry Cards. Place the Contract Card within reach of both players. Then lay out the 11 Upgrade Cards face up within reach of both players.&#10;&#10;Lastly, players each take 4 of their 30 eurocube markers and place them on four icons on any of their Industry Cards. Players may only place a marker on one each of the four resource types. Each card shows icons for a different resource type used in the game to construct the buildings and purchase upgrade cards.&#10;&#10;Play: Steam Lords is divided into rounds of four phases. Players take turns during phases 1, 3 and 4, and play simultaneously during phase 2. Players will alternate going first between rounds, with Player One going first in the first round, Player Two going first in the 2nd round, etc... Once all 4 phases have been completed, a new round begins.&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Contract&#10;Players take turns placing 5 workers (eurocube markers) on the Contract Card claiming either resources or distribution rights.&#10;Phase 2: Distribute&#10;Players simultaneously distribute resources, moving markers from the Resource Cards to the Industry Cards.&#10;During this phase, each player may &lsquo;deliver&rsquo; any resources for a total of 5 card units in distance. To calculate distance, count the number of cards up and over to the left or right you wish to move a resource.&#10;Phase 3: Build&#10;Players take turns constructing buildings on the Quarter Cards if they have all 5 resources needed on their Industry Cards.&#10;If a player has all 5 icons marked on an Industry Card, they may remove those markers and construct any of the unclaimed buildings on a Quarter Card. Once all 6 buildings have been constructed no more can be claimed. Each building built on a Quarter Card is worth 1VP.&#10;Phase 4: Upgrade&#10;Players take turns buying Upgrade Cards one at a time, and may only buy Upgrade Cards if they have built buildings in Coalside during phase 3. For each building built in Coalside, a player may buy 1 Upgrade Card during this phase. To purchase an Upgrade Card, a player must pay the number of resources shown at the bottom of each Upgrade Card. They may then take the card and place it in front of them.&#10;&#10;Four of the Upgrade Cards allow players to store additional resources on the Resource Cards. After purchasing one of the four cards replace the existing Resource Card with the new one. Each of these cards is worth 2VP. Seven of the Upgrade Cards let you construct building with fewer resources, gain distribution units or place more workers in phase 1.

Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.&#10;&#10;The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.&#10;    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.&#10;    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.&#10;    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.&#10;&#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;"

Fortunately, as you EVANGELIZE, you church's membership will grow numerically.  But, unfortunately you will soon discover that your church is composed not only of SPIRITUAL and CARNAL members, but also of HYPOCRITES.  On the other hand, your church can grow spiritually as you DISCIPLE these same members from HYPOCRITES to CARNAL and also from CARNAL to SPIRITUAL.&#10;&#10;Along the way you will encounter CIRCUMSTANCES which, depending upon the presence or absence of SPIRITUAL GIFTS in your church, will either help or hinder your overall growth.&#10;&#10;But sooner or later on one of the CIRCUMSTANCE cards, the RAPTURE will appear.  (Guaranteed to get a rise out of everybody).  Suddenly the game ends; and the SPIRITUALITY of your church is weighed in the balance (in this game, by a point system.  Will your church be found wanting... more points?)  The church with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Definitions:  Whats the RAPTURE?  Something to get all up in the air about, and the point at which the game ends.&#10;&#10;Whats the Church?  Another good question.  We've been debating it for years.  For our purposes, in RAPTURE there are no buildings -- just people.&#10;&#10;What are SPIRITUAL GIFTS?  A part of this game and the REAL one.  There are over 20 listed in the Bible, we've selected 7 for this game.&#10;&#10;Whats the difference between a CARNAL and SPIRITUAL member?  See 1 Corinthians 3:1-3.&#10;---&#10;&#10;The game is a roll and move type game with different things happening based on the different spaces the player lands on.&#10;&#10;"

Only one of the decks is used during each game, as chosen by the players.  There is also a gameboard consisting of spaces with the vowel letters a, e, i, o, and u.&#10;&#10;On each turn, the player draws a card from the deck of vowel cards.  The player says the name of the object on the card, then advances to the first space that matches the vowel on the card.  To stay there, the player must say another object with the same vowel sound.  Other players may give hints if the player cannot think of one.  If they fail to name another object with the same vowel sound, the player must move back one space.  The vowel deck also contains advance or penalty cards that move a player forward or backward along the gameboard.  A player does not need to say an object when landing on a space due to one of these cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the treasure chest by advancing along the path and drawing a vowel card with an o sound (the letter shown on the treasure chest) wins the game.&#10;&#10;An alternate rule set allows for team play using the same gameplay, but no hints are allowed in this version.&#10;&#10;"
