The spinner will tell them which piece of clothing or accessory to add to their doll.  One space on the spinner requires the spinner to lose a piece.

Colors, players choose face-down cards, trying to be the first to complete a set and win the game. There are three different ways to play.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Search and Match Colors - Each player takes a card marked with a colored star designating which color he or she will collect. Picture cards are placed face-up in the center of the table. Each player in turn takes a card to match their color. If the color matches, the player keeps the card. If not, he or she must put it back. Play continues until all players have six matched color cards. This game is for very young players, and is meant to teach color recognition.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Seven That Match - This game is played similarly to Search and Match Colors. In this version, each player has two color cards to match. Cards are placed face down. Players pick one card at a time and try to match it to one of their cards. If it matches, the player keeps the card. If not, it goes back to the center face down. The first player to collect six cards matching the color of one of his or her star cards wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     What Color Do You See? - In this version, each player has a game board with spaces for eight different colors. All cards are placed face-down on the table. Players take turns choosing a face-down card. If the player doesn't yet have the color, he or she covers the corresponding space on his or her card. If he or she does have the color, the card goes back face down. In this version, there are also wild cards, which can be placed on any color. The first player to cover all colors on the card wins the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

You have a stack of cards that represent coffee orders, several coffee &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; and a playing area, which is a tablet on a dome shaped foot. The name part &ldquo;balance&rdquo; comes from the way it&rsquo;s played. You draw a card from the deck which tells you, if you need to place a straight coffee, a coffee-to-go, a Milk Coffee or one of the 2 Macchiato versions on the tablet. There is a grid on said tablet to determine the places where you can, but on a coffee to go you can stack another coffee if you like. Whoever tips the tablet over loses. Besides the usual red cards, there are also green ones in the deck. These give you the opportunity to order somebody else to place the coffee (with a green cup), of course on their own risk.&#10;&#10;2.Speed Order Caf&eacute;&#10;This speed game needs at least 2 baristas and 1 customer. The customer shuffles the deck of cards and pulls 5 into her hand. She than reads them aloud to the baristas. After all 5 orders are read the customer gives the start sign, and all baristas start to assemble the coffees in order. Whoever is fastest stops the game. If she is correct on all coffees she wins, otherwise the win goes to the next most complete and errorless contender.&#10;&#10;3.Black and Milk Reversi&#10;This is just Othello played with the components of the game.&#10;&#10;4.Coffee Cup Tower&#10;This is a stacking game were 2 or more players (Variant A/B) are stacking Black Coffee cups and Coffee-To-Go&rsquo;s as high as possible.

However, the police also has sent a team of undercover agents to infiltrate the triad. Ten years later, they are still undercover, but their minds have been twisted by the temptation of power, authority and money &mdash; and nobody is certain about their original roles anymore. Both groups learn that they have been infiltrated and want to ferret out the moles. Each mole has a secret code to lock their identity file, and once the code is cracked their identity is fully revealed. The battle of wits starts now. Either exposing the enemy or taking the chance to change the identity for good can save their lives as long as nobody knows who is who!&#10;&#10;Internal Affairs is an intense elimination game between infiltrators from both the Triad and the Police Force Infiltrator. Each player has a set of secret ID cards which determine that player's allegiance. Each player also has a secret code, which when cracked reveals the player's real ID. At the beginning of the game, each player has five code cards and chooses three of them to be the secret code that locks the identity file. During their turn, players try to crack other players' codes to find out who is who and get their team to victory. Due to action cards, though, ID cards may be passed from player to player and this may change each player's allegiance. Players must be quick to win, as otherwise they may end up in the losing team when they least expect it.&#10;&#10;Internal Affairs is designed for 5-8 players, but alternative rules have been included to allow for play with 2-4.&#10;&#10;"
