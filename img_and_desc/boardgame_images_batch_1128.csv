Gaining reputation will not be easy, and they&rsquo;ll have to contend with more than just their rivals.

Combine delicious Topping cards, use sneaky Actions, and create the tastiest Toasts spread to score the most points!&#10;&#10;Toasty Toasts is played over several turns, where each player may take a number of actions before passing the turn to the next player on their left (clockwise). Turns continue until the &ldquo;Time to Eat!&rdquo; card is drawn, at which point the game ends, and players proceed to the scoring phase.&#10;&#10;Each player turn can be split into three quick phases (Draw, Play, Hand Check). Once the active player has completed two actions&mdash;or passed&mdash;they check their hand to ensure they have seven or fewer cards. Should their hand hold an excess of seven cards, the active player must place cards from their hand into the discard pile until their hand holds seven cards. Play then passes to the player on the active player&rsquo;s left.&#10;&#10;Once the &ldquo;Time to Eat!&rdquo; card is drawn, play ends immediately. Each player counts their score and the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;description from designer&#10;&#10;"
