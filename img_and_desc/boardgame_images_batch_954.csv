Three colors are involved: White, Black, and Grey (neutral). Players Black and White own stacks with their own color on top. The field is initially filled with single checkers of all 3 colors. The third color may be neutral or owned by a third player. The checkers are tiled so that they are evenly spaced. This game may also be played on a square grid tiled with evenly spaced White and Black checkers.&#10;&#10;Players take turn distributing stacks: On your turn, you pick up one stack with your color on top, and immediately place a blockade (stone of your color) on that empty point. Then, distribute the stack. This means for each checker in the stack you are holding, move exactly that many points in a straight line in any direction and drop the bottom checker on that destination. Repeat this process as long as checkers remain in the stack. Note that &quot;any direction&quot; means any of the six hexagonal directions, or, on the square version, any of the eight orthodiagonal directions.&#10;&#10;The board gets increasingly restricted: Nobody can drop checkers on points occupied by blockades of either color. While distributing, you may jump over blockades of your color, but not the opponents.&#10;&#10;Game end: A player loses when they are unable to make a legal move.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

You and the opposing generals determine the battleground, gather resources, and score points by eliminating enemy units. Whoever first captures 25 points of units wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to set up choose one of the six factions in the game; each faction has twelve unique units and five &quot;home terrain&quot; cards that work well with your units. Players then take turns building the battleground by placing one terrain card at a time into the 3x3 grid, each terrain card is divided into a 2x2 grid, so the entire grid of play is 6x6. Whoever places terrain first has an advantage since they have more home terrain than other players, while players who go later during set up determine the location of resource centers on the battleground or recruit their starting units last so that they can respond to the choices of opponents. Units cost 1-5 gold, and each player can spend up to 10 gold on starting units, keeping anything unspent.&#10;&#10;During a round, all units have the chance to move, with the highest-ranked units moving first and with ties being broken in favor of whoever has the most captains, followed by whoever has the most units. Each unit has a movement, attack, and health value, along with an indication of whether it generates gold or mana and (possibly) a spell that it can cast. After moving a unit, you can attack with it, whether melee or ranged as indicated on the card. If you defeat an enemy unit, you can points equal to its cost in gold, so while expensive units tend to be the most powerful, they also provide an opponent with their biggest target for points.&#10;&#10;Prior to activating a unit on your turn, you can pay gold to recruit new units, and those units will slip into rank order for the turn, possibly allowing you to put a high-ranking unit into play directly and giving an opponent someone on the battleground that they didn't expect.&#10;&#10;Once all the units have moved, players collect resources for units that gain them automatically and for units located on resource centers. Rounds continue until someone has collected 25 points of captured units, at which point they win immediately.&#10;&#10;Factions: Battlegrounds is centered on inclusion and diversity, incorporating mythology from all over the world and representing traditionally European-based fantasy elements with underrepresented cultural elements.&#10;&#10;"

Packaged in a tuck box (not our standard 2 part box) and simplified to contain only the four basic card types (Keeper, Goal, New Rule, and Action), 73% of the cards are fundamentally unchanged from the current Fluxx 4.0/Fluxx 5.0 game sold in game stores. The more complex cards in the main game have been removed, and 11 cards that have been seen before in other versions or as promo cards have been included. There are 16 all new cards, most of them Goals that combine long time Keepers in fun new ways. The Keeper artwork has been updated with new illustrations by Michael Hays.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Navigate the skies of random chance and rely on strategic trickery to pop your opponent before you yourself are popped.&#10;&#10;More simply, the goal of the game is to pop the balloon/Blink your opponent designated as the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; before they pop the balloon/Blink you designated as your &ldquo;Crown.&rdquo; Players take turns single clicking their opponent's balloons to reduce their health and eventually pop them. Watch out for any Trap balloons! These are Blinks that will cause you to lose immediately if you pop them. The catch is, the location of each player&rsquo;s respective Crown and TrapBust balloons will only be known to them. It&rsquo;s a game of hidden information and bluffing! Two players recommended, but can easily accommodate more!&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Distribute Balloons&#10;Divide the Balloons/Blinks evenly among the players. Each player clusters their balloons together, and assigns each balloon a color.&#10;&#10;Single-click a balloon to cycle between Red (high health), Blue (medium health), and Green (low health). For even fair play, make sure each player has the same number of each color. To give one player an advantage, allow them to have more high-health balloons.&#10;Create Special Balloons &#10;Decide how many Crowns and/or Traps each player will have. Again, for even play, each player should have the same amount.&#10;&#10;Long Press a balloon to designate it as a Crown. Single-click it to cycle between the Crown and Trap Balloon designation. Crown Balloons appear yellow, and Trap Balloons appear purple. Long-pressing again will reset it back to a regular Balloon.&#10;&#10;While creating these special balloons, make sure to hide your selection from your opponent - this step is where your strategic trickery begins! It might seem obvious to always select a Red Balloon as your Crown since they take the longest to pop. But your opponent knows this too, so they may start clicking the Red Balloon first. Knowing that, you could instead select a Blue Balloon as a Crown, making your opponent waste 3-6 clicks popping a non-Crown Balloon. Let the game theory begin!&#10;&#10;Triple click one balloon on each player's cluster to move to start the game. Your Crown and Trap balloons will now appear as regular balloons, and the health of all balloons will be set based on their color.&#10;Gameplay&#10;On their turn, players take on of two actions:&#10;Attack&#10;Click an opponent's Balloon to reduce its health, shown by the number of faces lit. Each click reduces health by 1. When a balloon is reduced to 0 health, it pops, revealing whether it was a Crown, a Trap, or neither.&#10;&#10;[diagram of slowly reducing health and death]&#10;Fortify&#10;You also can use your turn to fortify your own balloons. Remove a single balloon from your cluster to activate it - a single white face will appear on the Balloon. When you reconnect that Balloon to the cluster, it will transfer 1 unit of health to the Balloon it touches with the activated face.&#10;&#10;Only balloons with at least 1 health remaining can be used to Fortify, and Balloons with 6 health cannot receive fortification.&#10;&#10;Win Condition&#10;There are multiple ways to win Battle Balloons. If you pop all of your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Balloons, you are the winner!&#10;&#10;[diagram of winning]&#10;&#10;If, instead, you pop your opponent&rsquo;s Trap Balloon, they are the winner!&#10;&#10;[diagram of losing]&#10;&#10;To reset the game, double-click any Balloon in your cluster to go back into Setup.&#10;Alternate Setup&#10;If you are playing with very few Blinks, you can instead give all Blinks to a single player and let them make the setup, then pass the entire cluster to the next player. That player then plays through the game with that cluster, counting the number of rounds it takes to win or lose.&#10;&#10;In addition, you can play with more than 2 players. In a multiplayer game, you choose who to attack on your turn. If a player&rsquo;s Crown Balloons are popped, they are out of the game. If you pop a Trap Balloon, you are out. The last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;"

It is played on the spaces (squares) of a square board of any size.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, all squares of the board are covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the center square is occupied by White. Additionally, each player must have access to a sufficient number of off-board pieces of their own color.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.&#10;&#10;A stack is a piece lying directly on the board along with all other pieces piled onto it on the same square. The color of a stack is the color of its topmost piece, which denotes its owner. The height of a stack is the number of pieces in it.&#10;&#10;A group is a stack along with all other like-colored stacks one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stacks of its color. The size of a group is the number of stacks in it.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pass.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Move the topmost piece of a stack of your color onto an adjacent enemy stack, provided that, before the move, the heights of both stacks are the same. Then, place a piece of your opponent's color onto the stack from which you just moved your piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. On even-sized boards, if the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;VariantsFree Swack: The board is initially empty. On your turn, instead of making a swap, you may place a friendly stack of height two on an empty square and an enemy stack of height one on an empty square orthogonally adjacent to it. At the end of the game, if the scores are tied all the way down to the smallest group, whoever made the last move wins.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesSwack is based on the same designer's Escabel and Micha&#197;&#130; Zapa&#197;&#130;a's Slyde.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
