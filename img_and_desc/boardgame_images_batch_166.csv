The games are touted as being good for the brain.&#10;&#10;There are at least four different games you can play with the Janken Plus set, though not all of them are Rock-Scissors-Paper games.&#10;&#10;1. Janken Game: Because the four boards are interlocking, they can be arranged differently, as a 6X6 square (basic game using all 24 janken pieces), or other arrangements with games for 12 pieces.&#10;&#10;The pieces can be moved in any direction, any number of squares. Pieces are taken in the traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock way. The game ends when one player has only two pieces left. On the box it says it's a similar game to Shogi.&#10;&#10;2. Play-off Janken: Each player places their pieces face down; they can arrange the pieces as they like. The board isn&rsquo;t used. They each choose one piece and play janken. The winner is the player who captures the most of their opponent&rsquo;s pieces. (This is not a thinking game.)&#10;&#10;3. Tic-Tac-Toe variant: Using one board, the players play a Tic-Tac-Toe game aiming to get three pieces in a row. Once a player has played three pieces, he or she can only move them on the board. A variant is to use two or more unconnected boards and more pieces, with the ability to move pieces from board to board.&#10;&#10;4. Pinch-pon: Players use six pieces each on the 6X6 board. They capture their opponent&rsquo;s pieces by sandwiching them between two of their own (as in the ancient game of Hnefatafl and similar games).&#10;&#10;"

Success is stated in a number of &quot;6s.&quot;  An easy task may require only one 6 to be rolled, but a difficult one might require six 6s.  Likewise, movement is 1&quot; as a base, but can be more depending on the number of 6s rolled, how the ship handles in general, and ship's angle to the wind.  Combat is also resolved comparing 6s rolled.&#10;&#10;Before the game, every ship has a record sheet and must be rated for Handling, Hull (ability to take damage), Crew Combat Quality, Crew Morale, and Crew Damage Control.&#10;&#10;As in most Matrix games, the player chooses how many dice (d6s) to roll at any given time, which can vary at his whim.  For an easy task, a player may opt to roll only one die, or two dice, or a dozen.  The catch is that while 6s succeed, every &quot;1&quot; that is rolled causes something bad to happen to the ship of the die roller!  The more 1s you roll, the worse it gets.&#10;&#10;"

The advanced rules add a sort of opportunity fire where a unit may interfere with enemy movement by declaring it as a target (provided the enemy is within a certain distance).&#10;&#10;The Operations Orders set up victory conditions and other effects (such as defensive positions) - thus, in a 2 player game, some information will not be shared between players.

Three traveler cards are dealt to the centre of the table, one of which is face up - this is the value of the holiday. The other players, in turn, may agree to this destination, or change it by paying one traveler card (and augmenting the value of the holiday). This goes round, players changing destinations as long as they want to and can afford to, until everyone finally agrees on the destination.&#10;&#10;Players then play cards that match the criteria for that destination and the player who plays travelers with the highest score wins the holiday. This is scored as the value from the initial 3 cards plus any extra cards played to change the destination, divided by ten. Points that don't make up to ten exactly don't contribute to the score.&#10;&#10;The player to first score 10 points wins.&#10;&#10;The game has a nice element of bluffing as a player could propose holiday destinations they have no interest in so that after other players change the destination, they can change it to the real place they'd prefer to go.&#10;&#10;"

It isn't made to teach a list of &quot;facts&quot; about the gospel. Instead, gospel principles are woven into the very fabric of the game. It doesn't give any advantage to the scriptorians or historians. Succeeding at the game requires cooperation, caring for other players, knowing how to build a solid foundation in one's youth, and an understanding of how faith and testimony help you endure trials, and any player who approaches the game in this manner can win.&#10;&#10;The game is great at fostering friendly interaction among the players. Even the losers enjoy it, because they tend to end up being the focus of charitable efforts by the other players. Succeeding at the game requires strategy, luck, and advance planning. It teaches LDS values, including the importance of building a foundation that will withstand the adversities of life, the value that hardships can have in building testimony, and the benefits of selfless service. Yes, there is competition in Mortality, because there is a winner, and that's a big part of the entertainment value. But a great part of the fun is in the joking that surrounds the dealing together with experiences and trials in the game that are so much a part of life, but are presented in a somewhat humorous way.&#10;&#10;Mortality takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half to play, depending on the experience and luck of the players. It requires a minimum of three players and up to six can play. Young children can be helped to play the game, but truly understanding it requires an age of at least eight.&#10;&#10;You start the game in the childhood section. Here you gain points or &quot;Testimonies&quot; as they are called, strictly by chance, based on what your family does. From there you enter the youth section. As a youth, you begin making decisions on your own that can help you later on or be a detriment to your later progress. You can serve as an LDS missionary, go on dates, and either get a civil marriage or a temple marriage. Avoiding a civil marriage may require some careful advance planning in order to avoid landing on the &quot;civil marriage&quot; square. From there you move into the adult section. One player gets to be the bishop. This assignment may pass from player to player depending on what happens in the game. As you move around in the adult section, you encounter trials of faith. Depending on how many Testimonies you already have, these trials can hurt you or help you. You also have an opportunity to help other players, for which you will gain even more Testimonies. The first player with 150 Testimonies &quot;finishes mortality&quot; and is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
