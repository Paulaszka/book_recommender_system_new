In this colossal game, players lead their historic civilization as they gain victory points by expanding their population, building cities, trading and developing their knowledge and culture. Notwithstanding its large scope, the game's core mechanics are straightforward and easy to learn. A key element in the game is player interaction as they position themselves on the map board and search for valuable commodities during interactive trading sessions.&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;Each player starts their civilization in the Stone Age with a single population token on the board. As the game progresses, the population will expand, spread over the board, fight some border conflicts and build cities. Cities bring resources and wealth, expressed in trade cards. The more cities players manage to build on the board, the more trade cards they receive. Trade cards are mainly valuable commodities, but sometimes turn out to be disastrous calamities.&#10;&#10;Trade&#10;Trading is the heart of the game, a social experience where all players interact with each other to optimize the value of their sets of commodities. In addition to the desired commodities, calamities are secretly traded as well, adding an additional layer to the trading dynamics. Once the trading phase has ended, players that end up with a calamity in their hand will suffer its effects.&#10;&#10;Develop Civilization Advances&#10;When the smoke of trading and resolving calamities has settled, players can decide how to spend the wealth gathered through trading. The game includes 51 different advances that can be developed, each of which provides benefits in the game to its holder. For example, Metal Working provides an advantage when fighting conflicts, Architecture facilitates city construction and Enlightenment reduces the impact of (civil) calamities.&#10;&#10;The 51 Civilization advances are divided into the categories Arts, Crafts, Science, Civics and Religion, each of which has specific powers. Each advance acquired by a player provides discounts to other advances that can be purchased later in the game, thereby creating a path of strategic decisions. The ultimate advance in the game, Wonder of the World, is only in reach for players who manage both their trading and purchasing strategy very well.&#10;&#10;Winning the Game&#10;The players who have best developed their position on the board whilst avoiding making enemies, and defended their civilization against natural or civic calamities and stand the test of time, will eventually gather the most victory points and compete for winning the game. After up to 12 hours of playing, that is.&#10;&#10;Combining with Mega Empires: The West'&#10;Mega Empires: The East can be combined with Mega Empires: The West (2019) to scale up the game to as many as 18 players! Where The East has a strong focus on movement by land, The West concentrates on the Mediterranean Sea, which stimulates movement by ship. Both games were designed as equally balanced counterparts, albeit with unique characteristics. Since many phases in the game are played simultaneously, larger player numbers do not materially increase the total playing time.&#10;&#10;Expansions&#10;Mega Empires: The Special Buildings (2024) is an expansion set that provides additional flavor to the game through 18 miniatures of ancient buildings historically associated with each of the civilizations in the game. These buildings can be built on the map board and provide additional benefits in play and victory points to their controller.&#10;&#10;Accessories&#10;The Mega Empires: The East &#226;&#128;&#147; Deluxe Game Mat (2024) is a neoprene game mat at 125% scale of the original cardboard map that offers an enlarged playing area and high-quality design for easier and more immersive gameplay.&#10;&#10;The Mega Empires: Identifier Cards Bonus Pack (2024) is a set with 18 large player identifier cards, one for each of the Civilizations included in Mega Empires. These can be used for distributing the civilizations among the players during setup, to identify which stack of Civilization Advances belongs to which player, or to divide acquired cards from not yet acquired ones during the game.&#10;&#10;Wrap-up&#10;Mega Empires: The East is a long strategic board game about development, trade, culture, politics and showing resilience when dealing with calamities. The game is a perfect fit for larger groups of strategic board game enthusiasts, which, due to its scalability, can also be played in smaller groups.

In Triumvir, you take the role of one of these Roman power brokers as you vie for power and position that inevitably leads to Civil War.&#10;&#10;Triumvir builds on Versailles 1919 where players use influence to gain control over issues and the path that history will take going forward. In Triumvir, you will use your three-dimensional influence in popularity, money, and legions to vie for the Consulship, Pontifex Maximus, and Governorships as you try to outmaneuver your erstwhile friends on the floor of the Senate. The game can be played with 1 &ndash; 3 players.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you will perform one of three actions: Place influence (popularity, money, or legions) on issues that are being debated in the Senate, Recover exhausted influence, or Settle an issue. These actions are punctuated by elections, revolts in the provinces, and domestic unrest. As one of the Triumvirs, you will have to balance your tempo of activities to ensure that you are not caught short on your ability to influence how events evolve and progress.&#10;&#10;Although Triumvir uses many of the basic mechanics from Versailles 1919, the design is thematically aligned to its subject. When an issue settles, your choices will alter your popularity and resources where the Consul often gets his cut. Each player has a unique personality card that asymmetrically captures your personality&rsquo;s strengths in how they gain and recover influence. These characteristics are enhanced by your growing tableau of patrons&mdash;some of whom bring additional resources.&#10;&#10;Revolts are intense events where the Governor of the affected province has to re-establish Roman rule. Failure to do so carries tough popularity penalties whereas success raises your stature. If you put down a particularly epic revolt in a grand fashion you can be awarded a Triumph with extra legions, but remember&mdash;sic transit gloria. The tides of fate can often turn against you in the next election or foreign war.&#10;&#10;This political danse macabre continues until the &lsquo;Crossing the Rubicon&rsquo; issue ends the Roman Republic and brings on a Civil War or one player dominates faction standing.

You also manage three heroic leaders that journey around the tile map to aid your forces against the Dark Overlord; the rising threat to the free nations.&#10;&#10;Designed as a solitaire game, forces of the Dark Overlord are controlled by the game system. These forces consist of black cubes (dark army), blue cubes (hellbreed), and purple cubes (ghoul hordes). The dark army represents the overlord&rsquo;s regular army, the hellbreed represents his supernatural army, and the ghoul hordes represent his enslaved army.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game you are attempting to build up your white cubes while keeping the rival cubes to a minimum. A major feature in the game is &ldquo;worker placement&rdquo;. To overcome the Dark Overlord you must have your task force cubes (workers) fulfill various missions in order to recruit more forces and outwit the Dark Overlord. Ultimately, you must prevail in a final battle on the center tile in order to win the game.&#10;&#10;A game turn consists of 3 phases. The first phase involves the emergence of rival cubes. The second phase involves the fulfilment of task spot effects (based on the accomplishments of your task force cubes). The third phase of the turn allows you decision-making opportunities using your heroes. At this point you can move your heroes, perform combat, deploy forces, pick up forces, and drop off runestones.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

It includes a dolphin, a squid and a rock band of rabbits. The family are created by an artist Raityo Tsume (&#233;&#155;&#183;&#233;&#179;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#129;) and are popular in Japan in SNS messaging apps.&#10;&#10;The various characters in the Kmakici family are on the cards in different combinations. Players draw and play cards to the table from a hand of three, trying to build sets of five different characters. If a player places a card which completes a set of five, they draw a token from the end of a line.&#10;&#10;The tokens show a grilled steak initially, but on the hidden side are sweets, cakes and teatime treats. Players are trying to get four different treats to win the game outright.&#10;&#10;However, if a player cannot or will not play a card, they draw a steak, which, being unsuitable for a tea party, counts as negative points. If all the tokens are claimed without a direct winner, then the player with fewest steaks wins.&#10;&#10;Whilst the game is aimed squarely at young children, a Japanese reviewer found the game to be more complex and challenging than expected.&#10;&#10;The publisher says:&#10;Let's start a great teatime with our friends.&#10;&#10;In this game, you have to collect five different characters on the field. When it is your turn to play, you draw a card from the deck and put up to three cards from your hand on the field. However, only one card of the same type of character can be played on the field.&#10;&#10;If you manage to get the fifth character on the field, you get the candy on the back of the chip.&#10;&#10;The chips are laid out in a straight line, steak side first, and are taken in the order in which they are laid out during the game.&#10;&#10;If you don't have any cards to play or don't want to play, you will have to take the steak (negative points).&#10;&#10;If a player is able to collect four different sweets, that player wins at that moment, and if all the chips are gone, the player with the least steak wins.&#10;&#10;&#229;&#143;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;5&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#233;&#155;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#229;&#136;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#157;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#177;&#177;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;3&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#144;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#168;5&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#191;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#163;&#143;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#232;&#143;&#147;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#133;&#165;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#156;&#128;&#229;&#136;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#157;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#144;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#230;&#156;&#172;&#233;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#228;&#184;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#239;&#188;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#232;&#143;&#147;&#229;&#173;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#146;4&#231;&#168;&#174;&#233;&#161;&#158;

Zoo Break is compact and easy to grasp for kids as young as five, who are still learning their numbers, but it involves strategy and level variations that make it intriguing for the sharpest of gamers. (We challenge advanced gamers to try getting through Levels 1-10 in one play session!) Zoo Break can be played alone, or collaboratively by multiple people. It's a great family game.&#10;&#10;To play, simply shuffle the cards and lay them out in an 8x8 grid. Place the four colorful wooden animals in the center. Roll the green dice to guide the animals to freedom, using strategy to choose the best path for each animal. But watch out for the zookeeper! For every roll of the animal dice, you'll also roll the zookeeper dice. The zookeeper locks down cards and closes off escape routes with every roll.&#10;&#10;Win the game by breaking out all four animals before their escape routes close. Strategy abounds around which paths to take, and this makes for great interaction with kid co-players. Four free spaces help you on your way. But if the zookeeper locks down a card that is currently occupied by an animal, it's back to the central cage!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The attack over the Jarama river was to be coordinated with the Italian&rsquo;s offensive to the north and east of the city along the Guadalajara river. However, the Italians were taking longer than anticipated to get their forces into positions, hindered by poor weather and abysmal planning. With growing impatience General Franco ordered his forces to attack, supported by the German Condor Legion as well as masses of new German tanks, artillery pieces and ample supplies of ordinance.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

The goal of the game is to win the most cards. Gameplay is directed by one of 6 different cats that appear on the cards. Three cats provide players the opportunity to see the country map and its capital on their opponents&rsquo; cards, which players will be challenged to successfully remember later in play. The other 3 cats direct various play that allow players to steal or win cards by either correctly naming the capital for a given country, or by carefully selecting an opponent who will not likely know or remember the correct answer.&#10;&#10;Each of the 60 cards has a unique colorful map depicting several countries with one or more capitals identified.  One round of the game takes approximately 20 minutes.  The game moves fast enough that several rounds can be played, which has the benefit of introducing more countries and capitals into play.  A more challenging game can be played by requiring all capitals on a given card to be correctly named in order to win the card.&#10;&#10;The game can be enjoyed by people of varied ages and knowledge as everyone gets an opportunity to win cards based on their own competencies and strategy.  Ultimately though, as one learns more capitals of the world a distinct advantage will develop, especially if one plays repeatedly.&#10;&#10;"
