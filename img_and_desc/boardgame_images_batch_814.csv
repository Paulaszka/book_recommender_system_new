At the start of a round, each player is dealt a hand of ten cards (or in later rounds, each player receives an equal number of cards with any remaining cards being set aside). Each player chooses two cards to pass face down to their right-hand neighbor, then the round begins. In the first round, choose a starting player at random; in later rounds, the loser of the previous round begins.&#10;&#10;The starting player chooses one card from their hand and plays it into the center of the table. Each player in turn must play a card of the same strength or higher; if a player can't play higher or doesn't want to, then they must discard their single lowest card. This is called a &quot;tail-tucking move&quot;.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, whoever has played the highest card (with later-played cards breaking a tie), leads a card to the next round. If at least one player has performed a tail-tucking move, then you can play a set of cards of the same strength (from two- to five-of-a-kind) instead of a single card. If you do, in turn, each player must play a set of the same strength of higher; if they can't or won't, then they must discard a number of their lowest cards equal to the number of cards in the set.&#10;&#10;A player cannot play a set that would leave them with no cards in hand, which means that the final trick of the round must be with a single card. Whoever plays the highest single card loses the round, and they collect their card and the two lowest-valued cards, then place those cards in the doghouse in front of them. You scoop any cards not in doghouses, then shuffle and deal the next round.&#10;&#10;When a player collects seven different types of cards in front of themselves, the game ends and they lose. (Alternatively, the game ends if so many cards have been placed in doghouses that you can't deal at least five cards to each player.) When the game ends, whoever has collected the fewest cards wins.&#10;&#10;"

Most of the actions involved small craft armed with automatic weapons and torpedoes attacking other patrolling coastal forces as well as supply convoys and small war ships. Most of the actions took place under the cover of darkness since stealth and surprise were vital to the survival of these small craft.&#10;&#10;This is not a game for large capital ships or huge fleets. The game is designed to allow each player to assume the command of a handful of small boats in order to refight the type of actions that were typical of the coastal action fought throughout the war.&#10;&#10;Ideally these rules are used with 1/600th or 1/1200th scale models.

Each team will draft 9 batters and 3 pitchers each in any order they choose. You will need to set your lineup for your batters 1-9 and decide on which pitcher you will use to start the game.&#10;&#10;Each game is only 3 innings long. This is to keep the games shorter, kid friendly and gets you quicker into the next game. (We suggest you pitch a new pitcher each inning however, in advanced games you can play a full 9 inning game. In those cases it's suggested you pitch a new pitcher every 3 innings)&#10;&#10;All players have a special power that can be activated when they roll a Crush/Dominate on their die roll while batting/pitching.

Home team will pitch first and the visiting team will bat first. The goal of the pitcher is to get the batter out, either by strike out or through the contact deck in which the batter can hit into an out. The batters goal is to make contact with the pitch and draw from the contact deck to get a hit. Each player will pick one of the 3 colored dice that stand for each of the types of pitches in the game. The dice have numbers ranging from 1-5 and 1 CRIT Side. Both players pick 1 die to roll and then roll at the same time, then check the results. The Pitcher gets a +1 to their die roll if the batter did not match the pitchers colored die. This is for not guessing the right pitch in the at bat. However if the batter does match the pitch color they would receive the +1 to their die roll. If the batter meets or exceeds the pitchers roll they make contact with the ball and draws a single card from the hit deck. If the Pitcher exceeds the batters die roll the batter receives 1 strike. On 3 strikes the batter is out. If either player rolls the CRIT Side, that character activates their own power. It's often a hit for the batter and a strike for the Pitcher automatically but with card manipulation along with it.&#10;&#10;The Hit Deck has 50 cards and it's filled with automatic hits like: Home Runs, Triples, Doubles and Singles. There are also Contact Play Cards where it's hit out into the field and the pitchers team must successfully make a play on the ball or the batter gets a hit.

To add value to the product, Field of Mars has been designed to function as a complete game in its own right, suitable for playing both random and historical battles devised by the players. No knowledge of the Lace Wars rules is required. (Caveat: the game does not include any historical scenarios.) With some modification it could also be used to play battles generated by different game systems.&#10;&#10;The game uses a gridded mat and terrain tiles to create a wide variety of battlefields. The players' forces are deployed on this mat in stacks of counters called 'wings'; the wings are the 'manoeuvre unit' in this system. The players issue orders to their wings by rolling dice and distributing them among their wings. The more pips a die has showing, the greater the number of tactical choices its wing has. Once orders have been issued, a series of discrete steps is followed, each permitting the execution of one particular kind of action (for example: Advance, Fire, Assault). In each step the players decide whether any eligible wings (those with the correct die value) will execute that action. The object of the game is to render opposing wings hors de combat. In the context of the game this means the wing is removed from play. This is accomplished through artillery and musket fire, cavalry charges, and infantry assaults. The first side to go over the required number of hors de combat wings loses the battle.&#10;&#10;The rules include instructions for creating random battles using the counters provided and also instructions on how to use the game to fight battles generated within the Lace Wars system.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;1) One large play mat, called the Battlefield.&#10;2) 360 die cut counters representing various generic forces, plus markers.

As one of Snoozehaven&rsquo;s worst adventurers you&rsquo;ll be squabbling over the right to be the Party Leader, avoiding the &ldquo;take-that&rdquo; of the bungling buffoons around you and trying to get enough gold to leave behind your failure-fraught-fellowship. You&rsquo;ll have to manage both your hand and your expectations... you guys really are terrible.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ve never really managed it as a hero. In fact, you&rsquo;ve been the undoing of many a quest. Half of the parties you&rsquo;ve adventured with ended up trapped in a cave-in you triggered, skewered by a trap you detonated or cooked by a monster you thought you could converse with. Somehow you have always ended up leaving unscathed, eager to join another party and change this streak of &lsquo;bad luck&rsquo;. It seems now though, just as a dragon has come to Snoozehaven and heroes look to band together, that your reputation has begun to precede you. As the numbers dwindle in the tavern and heroes sing their way to battle, you realise your hopes rest with the no-hopers sat around you.

Giving each player different special abilities, decks of cards, weapons and armour based on the mixture of the character they randomly generate. Each combination allows for a different synergy of humorous attacks and bungles that reflect a character&rsquo;s personality as they desperately strive to become respected as an adventurer.&#10;&#10;Players will be trying to get the most gold by the end of the game. Maybe that way one of the &quot;real adventuring parties&quot; will take them on...&#10;&#10;Along with gold, some monsters will drop valuable treasure which may give the heroes the edge over the painfully pathetic party members.&#10;&#10;Players will find the key to the game is keeping hold of the title of Party Leader, but it won't be easy... These calamitous cretins can't stand to be told what to do!&#10;&#10;With so much disruption and chaos, mistakes will be made, often at the risk of those nearby. Attacks are resolved using a D20, and bungles increase the chance of a critical fail. So be careful, as a party prone to accidents, you don't want to be standing too close when an axe swing is&nbsp; wildly off target!&#10;&#10;In a game of fast flying dice, jockeying for first position and strategic card play, anything can happen. The heroes just need to stick together until they defeat the dragon, then they can go their separate ways....
