There were worlds to discover, creatures to see and most importantly magic to master. But with all these things to keep them busy there was one thing they did not forget, Power. Soon it was easier to take from others than to find it on your own. The only place to hide was in great magical towers that they built between dimensions. All times in your world and in the others are at your disposal.&#10;&#10;Will you be the last to Reign in Towers in Time?&#10;&#10;Play overview:&#10;Each player represents a spellcaster, dueling with the other players for control of an abstractly defined extradimensional space.  Each player has five shields, represented by cards from that player's deck, that serve to anchor the player the dimension within the game's story, and as the player's presence in the game mechanically.  The goal is to eliminate the shields of all other players; when a player has no shields remaining, they are banished from the pocket dimension, and out of the game.  Victory goes to the last player with shields in play.&#10;&#10;To combat one another, players play Source cards, representing connections to various natural locations, be they landforms, weather phenomena, or natural disasters.  These resource cards allow the player to access Temper, the main resource in Towers in Time, themed to the four elements.  Using Temper, players pay the costs to summon creatures to wage war, conjure magical objects and artifacts to enhance the effectiveness of recruited creatures, and cast spells to strengthen their minions and weaken the opposing armies.  Additionally, once creatures are in play, most of them can provide Temper as well, although typically less than Source cards; most cards in Towers in Time are resource generators in addition to their other game effects.&#10;&#10;Source cards serve as the base for the titular Towers of Towers in Time.  Each Source has a default file of three ranks atop it, each space of which can be occupied by creatures and the cards they carry.  Creatures enter play within Towers, and must match the element represented by the Source atop which it stands (except for Neutral creatures, which may be played into any Tower).  There are rules to determine which creatures can enter play in which locations within a Tower, but once in play, most creatures can move between Towers, taking attached cards with them when they move.&#10;&#10;Turns do not follow the turn format common to many contemporary CCGs.  Instead, several phases are completed simultaneously by all players, then players alternate initiating and resolving a single action until both players have passed.  Action resolution varies depending on their effect, with some actions initiating a separate resolution phase with its own actions and timing (such as combat) and others are single-step actions (such as playing a card).  Additionally, a number of supplemental actions (&quot;free&quot; actions) facilitate utility functions, such as drawing Temper to pay for spells.  The opportunity to act first during the action round is determined by the player who won initiative during game setup (for the first turn only), or the player who did not take the last pass action on the previous turn.&#10;&#10;"

A while back, Guillaume showed us a prototype of a game in which players had to find English expressions through their literal French translations - averaging about two clues per phrase. This idea, highly innovative in terms of a game, went over very well in tests. We were reminded of the book &quot;Sky my Husband&quot;, which was based on a similar idea (it included literal French translations of English phrases) - and sold over 200,000 copies over the last 10 years. It seemed logical to us, then, to contact the book's author, Jean-Loup Chiflet. He was excited by the concept and helped us out greatly with the content, as well as getting permission from the book's publisher to use the same title.&#10;&#10;In the game, 460 expressions, each with two clues, are read out by a player. The object of the game is to deduce the original English phrase the fastest. As an example, one English phrase is &quot;Tie-break&quot;. The literal French translation &quot;Repos de cravate&quot; (Resting tie) is provided, along with two clues: Tennis and Deciding Game.&#10;&#10;"
12317,,"Here's a description of the game from Cocktail Games:&#10;&#10;Brouhaha is a game by Jean-Marc Pauly which interested us because of it's intergenerational nature, as well as the pleasant ambiance it generates around the table. The basis of the game is simple but highly effective: 42 Animal cards (21 pairs) and 4 Hunter cards are dealt out among the players. Each player then takes his cards into his hand without showing them to anyone else. Each player chooses a card and plays it face-down in front of himself. He then tries to mimic the cry of the animal on the card he has chosen, with the objective of finding its mate.&#10;&#10;As soon as two players think they share the same animal, the both knock the center of the table. This action suspends the game while the players check to see if they were correct. If they were, they are awarded their respective cards.&#10;&#10;At any time, a player who can't find his mate may take his card back into his hand and play out another, henceforth imitating the cry of the new card's animal instead.&#10;&#10;Players have to watch out for the Hunters, which let one imitate an animal's call...&#10;&#10;A game of hilarious cacophony for players 7 and up and which has an impressive variant intended for 42 players.&#10;&#10;"

The weather might get worse, and you might run out of fuel or bait, so look to your fellow fishermen to ensure that together you can get those fish to market.&#10;&#10;On a turn in Archipel, you navigate between the islands. If you're at a harbor, you can get fresh bait, fuel and other equipment, and you can also have a look at the weather. Weather tokens are placed on the game board, making sailing more difficult between storms. Fish are placed face down on the game board. To try to catch one, you flip it over to reveal it, but you must have the right bait on board. You'll possibly then need to sell the fish at market immediately as your boat can hold only so much fuel.&#10;&#10;If all the villages are fed and all players return home, then the day was a success and they've won; if no more fish can be delivered, however, they'll have to try again another day.&#10;&#10;"

12329,,"Cipangu (pronounced Chi-pon-gu) is the name given to the island of Japan by Marco Polo in his journals.&#10;  As the introduction on the rules sheet quotes, Marco Polo described Cipangu as a land &quot;...abounding in gold and producing vast quantities of the largest and finest pearls, together with a variety of precious stones, so that, in fact, it abounds in riches&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player is sending their sailing ship out into the uncharted ocean in an attempt to find the riches of Cipangu, and other smaller islands, and return them to their home port. These riches are represented in the game by shiny gold counters which look very much like wide, flat gold bars. Only gold returned to one's port counts for victory.&#10;&#10;The sailing ship's hulls are printed on cardboard sheets, to be punched out and folded into shape. Three wooden dowel masts are inserted through punched-out, printed paper sails and then through the decks of the ships.&#10;&#10;The board is a blank diagonal grid of 32 square ocean spaces with the four players' home ports in the corners. The 29 Sea Square tiles are shuffled and 32 of them placed face down on the spaces. There are four each of Island, Reef, Ship and Monster tiles plus the Cipangu tile, a Fog tile, and a Storm tile. All others are open sea.&#10;&#10;There are four Encounter Decks, cards from which are drawn when a ship discovers Islands, Reefs, Ships, and Monsters. The monsters are the only fantasy element of the game. Their artwork is drawn in the style of the &quot;Here There Be Monsters&quot; of the old mapmakers. Each deck has cards with good or bad results: gold bars, extra sailors, repairs, attacks by monsters or pirates, grounding on reefs, being attacked or helped by island natives, etc.&#10;&#10;Each ship starts with three sailors and three masts. The markers for the sailors are actually the familiar plastic push-pins available in any dollar store, without the pin. Both sailors and masts serve as 'hit-point' indicators: any ship that loses all masts or all sailors is sunk. Movement range is determined by current no. of masts to a maximum of 3 spaces.&#10;&#10;There is a wind direction spinner which is a 'top' made up of an octagonal direction card with a wood dowel through the center. This is spun to determine which direction a player's ship cannot sail that turn.&#10;&#10;Players move around the board, turning over the sea tiles and trying to accumulate gold and survive the various events that can damage their ship. When the one Cipangu tile is discovered, players can get 3 gold bars each turn they stay there.&#10;&#10;Players can also 'Turn Pirate' by attacking another player's ship or port. 1d6's are rolled and compared, low roller in each round loses one sailor, ties cause both ships to lose a mast. Ships that lose all sailors are plundered of their gold and sunk. Ships that lose all masts just sink.&#10;  Combat against ports is handled the same way except ports have no masts. Players can leave extra sailors in port as defense forces. Sunk ships are replaced, and damaged ships repaired, by paying one gold bar and continuing with a new/fixed 3-mast, 3-sailor ship from your port.&#10;&#10;Once the last Sea Tile is turned over, the game ends and Gold Bars are counted up to determine a victor.&#10;&#10;"

Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources? Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;&#10;"

12369,,"The APBA Golf Game was origionally published by APBA in 1962.   It contained 18 Greatest Holes and came with 32 well known golfers.   The 18 Greatest Holes publsihed in the 1962 edition contain 4 different holes than later versions of the 18 Greatest Holes.&#10;&#10;As the Golfer card sets ran out of production APBA publshed new sets to replace the out of production sets.   This led to the creation of a:&#10;&#10;1962/64 set, 1972, 1976, 1978, 1981, 1985 and an All Time Greats Set.   Sports Game Publishing and the APBA Journal also published a number of golf sets in later years as well.&#10;&#10;8 Courses were published by APBA officially (Two Versions of the 18 Greatest Holes).   The now defunct Sports Game Publishing company also published at least 3 more courses for the game adding: Sawgrass, Winged Foot, St. Andrews and Oakmont to the list.  The format for these course were 3 to a page on 11 x 17 paper and then changed to 8 1/2 x 11 with one course per page.&#10;&#10;ASG Golf (George Gerney | www.asggames.com) has gone on to publish courses for: Bethpage Black, Pinehurst No 2., Augusta National, Pebble Beach, TPC Scottsdale, St. Andrews, TPC Sawgrass and Bay Hill.&#10;&#10;From the APBA Journal: An Eighth APBA Golf Course (For Holes 3,4,5,6 of the greatest hits)&#10;&#10;&quot;While preparing the Golf Archives Reference Pack (now available from the AJ office). I encountered a letter to the editor in the August 15, 1971, issue of APBA Innings. (Back in those practically prehistoric days, the AJ covered only baseball, leaving APBA's other sports to its competition, AI.)&#10;&#10;The letter, by Doug Bauer, notes that the original APBA golf course, the 18 Greatest Holes compilation, had changed between the game's original appearance in the mid-1960's and 1971.&#10;&#10;In the original course, holes 3,4,5 and 6 all came from courses in Southem California. Number three was the fourth hole at Riviera Country Club, Los Angeles. a par three. Number four was the eighth hole from Lakeside Golf Course in Hollywood, a par four. APBA's fifth hole was the third at Vaney Club in Santa Barbara, a par four. And number six was the 14th at Los Angeles' Bel Air Country Club, a par five.&#10;&#10;In the later version, number three is the 13th hole at Congressional Country Club in Washington, D.C., a par four. APBA's fourth hole is the 14th at Brookline (Mass.) Country Club, a par five. Number five is the eighth hole at Westchester Country Club, Harrison, N. Y., a par four. And number six is the third hole at Akron's Firestone Country Club, also a par four.&#10;&#10;As a consequence of these changes, par is 71 in the later course but just 70 in the original version.&#10;&#10;So it turns out that there are, In effect, eight APBA golf courses rather than the seven we knew about:Augusta (1964), Merion (1975), Pebble Beach (1976), Firestone (1976), Pinehurst (1977), Pine Valley (1977) and two versions of the 18 Great Holes (1964 and c.1970).&quot;&#10;&#10;Sports Game Publishing was a company that published expansions for APBA products, they maintained a web presense from 2002 thru 2006.

Recently Dr. Cline started from scratch and carefully dissected the game with a mathematical precision not possible when the game was developed. The result is a game completely compatible with the golf courses and cards you currently own, while allowing you to play a modern golf bag and manage holes the way today&rsquo;s pros do.&#10;&#10;Golfers will drive the ball, hit fairways, and putt the way they do in real life. You can finally choose from the clubs the players really carry; no more 2-wood that today&rsquo;s players never use. Instead, choose a 4-wood, 5-wood, and/or 1-iron&mdash;just like the pros of today! If you have always wanted wind, course conditions, lie conditions, and each golfer&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;work the ball&rdquo; to have the same influence on your course that they have in the real game, now they can!&#10;&#10;Dr. Cline&rsquo;s new Master Game elements are individually implemented, so you can add some of them, all of them, or none at all, and still achieve a level of golf accuracy never before possible. Combined with charts that finally are capable of reproducing the abilities of golfers of the 21st century, this fantastic new game will allow you to use the golf courses and golf cards you already own with accurate results, while integrating future cards and courses as well.&#10;&#10;The new &ldquo;boards&rdquo; are actually a spiral-bound, 8&frac12; x 11-inch booklet, printed on card stock for durability, that contains complete playing instructions and play charts for both the Basic and Master games. The game box also includes all the components you need to play: dice, shaker, ball markers, and score sheets designed for use with both the Basic and Master games, along with nine sample golfers and a sample golf hole.&#10;&#10;APBA has announced that they plan on re-publishing APBA Golf in 2010.&#10;&#10;"
