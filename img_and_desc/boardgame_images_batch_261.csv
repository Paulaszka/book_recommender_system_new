29980,,"Fusilier: Tactical Combat in the Age of Napoleon is a 53-page miniatures rule set for 15mm figures.  Popular in Wisconsin and play tested for years at the University of Wisconsin game club.  Jim Harkonen's rules focus on the differences in formation in terms of fire, movement, damage taken, and morale, far more than most such rules.  The rules also focus on relative position and its effects on morale.  While relatively simple, any player who isn't thinking a few turns ahead in terms of position and formation is sure to be another casualty of war.  All rules are summarized on just three movement, fire, and morale charts.&#10;&#10;Order of Play:&#10;1. Movement&#10;     Reaction die roll&#10;     Charges and checks&#10;     Pursuit and out of control checks&#10;     Movement declaration&#10;     Movement Execution&#10;2. Fire&#10;3.

The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires he prosecute counterattacks throughout much of the game.&#10;&#10;Game play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their attack on 22 June 1941, and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objectives.

With this historic stroke of a pen, the stage was set for Union Pacific to open the American West to settlers and, in the process, connect a continent.  The transcontinental route heralded the Industrial Revolution and modernized transportation, turning the grueling, six-month, $1,000 journey from New York to San Francisco into a week long trip costing a mere $70.&#10;&#10;It took an army of 20,000 men, working 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for six years, to connect America east to west by rail.  It was a remarkable feat, as the system was built primarily by hand.  With the driving of the Golden Spike on May 10, 1869, the route was complete, and a vast, largely unpopulated region was poised for growth.&#10;&#10;Today, the 50,000 men and women of Union Pacific still connect America&rsquo;s communities, transporting the raw materials and finished goods that keep our economy, and our country, moving.&#10;&#10;Tokens include: Railroad crossing signal; Engineer&rsquo;s cap, Golden Spike, Caboose, Locomotive, and a Lantern.&#10;&#10;"

If Wellington's Anglo-Allied army could combine with the Prussians, the combined force would be larger than Napoleon's. Napoleon's strategy had been to cross the border into the Netherlands without alerting the Coalition and drive a wedge between their forces and subsequently to defeat the Prussians before turning on the Anglo-Allied army. Although the coalition commanders did have an overview of French pre-war movements, Napoleon's strategy was initially very successful.&#10;&#10;The battle cost Ney 4,000 men to Wellington's 4,800. Although a tactical draw, the allies had been unable to send forces to the aid of the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny.

The players sit at the corner of the board showing their respective icon.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. At the start of each round players reveal 1 to 4 stones of their color simultaneously. The number of revealed stones decides the order in which both players place their stones on the board.&#10;&#10;The player do not have a lot of choice when placing their stones since new stones must be placed in the current row - meaning: the row where the last stone was placed in the previous round. Only after the current row is filled completely the active player may select a new row by placing a stone at the edge of the board.&#10;&#10;It is much more important to foresee the order in which stones are placed since the resulting patterns on the board will decide the number of points each player gets at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The special flavour of the game results from the fact, that the scoring takes place in the vertical and horizontal lines of the board - running in a 45 degree angle to the rows where the stones were placed.&#10;&#10;Players earn points for each magic wand, meaning each combination of exactly three stones lying in line and adjacent to each other. The tricky part is, that a player will lose points for any magic wand that is too long - having more than three stones.&#10;&#10;"

30060,,"Scores of Bridge variants for fewer than four players have been invented, most of them for two players. The few games created for a threesome vainly searching for a fourth tend to be unexciting and overly dependent on luck. This is an attempt to fill the breach. Game play is very much like the parent game, although some changes in the scoring rules have been made. The major twist: the players who win the bidding must play defense&mdash;and they still have to take a majority of the tricks!&#10;&#10;"

It consists of a baseball field printed on the bottom of the box with a metal spinner in the middle, a rules sheet, and an envelope with nine blue and nine red cardboard disks.&#10;&#10;There is not a lot of strategy in this early game - each team uses the spinner on its turn to bat. Most of the results are either outs or hits (spaces for single, double, triple and home run), but there also are spaces for strikes, balls and base on balls. It is therefore possible but unlikely to get three strikes or four balls. There is one space for a foul ball, and any spinner stopping on a line is considered a foul as well.&#10;&#10;The one strategic option open to the batting team is whether to have base runners try to steal. In this event, the stealing team spins again, but uses an outer ring where the results are divided between &quot;out&quot;, &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;sacrifice&quot; (where the runner advances but the current batter is out). An out result always picks off the lead runner.&#10;&#10;* * see corrections in Community Wiki below&#10;&#10;"
