Three randomly drawn cards are placed side by side. Arrows on the outer cards will point on two attributes on the center card. The player whose turn it is chooses one of these attributes and asks the other players how they rate himself in regard of this attribute (like: &quot;I am funny&quot; or &quot;I make friends easily&quot;). All players (including the active player) secretly rate how much they think that the chosen attribute is correct. The players have numbered cards from 1 to 3 (4, 5 - depending on the number of players) which they play face-down. All cards are then flipped face-up. The numbers are added up, the sum is looked up in a table which will tell which number will grant its player a point.

Character Cards for each driver with his atributes: speed cards, first card, brake, attack and defense.&#10;4. Speed Cards; each driver has a set of four speed cards to determinate the movements and aceleration.&#10;&#10;Drivers must move using Speed Cards.

Drivers only can have one object card.&#10;&#10;Attack/defense:&#10;When drivers are moving they could attack other players using Object Cards.

Then He must start using Drivers first Speed Card.&#10;&#10;-Dangerous Curves:&#10;Some Road Cards have a special values like -1,-2,+1. These cards decrease Driver movement unless the Driver has a brake value bigger than 0. &#10;So if a player must go through a -2 curve and has a +1 brake value the movement decreases is only -1. Anyway if the driver finish a movement in a curve this decrease is not applied.&#10;&#10;"

Players are each dealt 10 face down cards which are arranged in spots from #1-10 to begin.  One player then draws a card from the top of the stock of remaining cards and uses it to replace a face-down card in the appropriately numbered spot if possible.  His turn continues until he draws a card that matches a card number already flipped or draws a Queen or King which cannot be placed in his array.  He discards the unusable card and his opponent can then choose to pick up that card and begin his turn by placing it into the appropriate spot in his array.  Jacks are considered wild and can be replaced by the appropriate number if they are already placed in one's array.  The first person to fill all of his spots with face-up cards wins the round and will play the next round with one less spot (so after round 1, for example, he will only use 9 cards).  The game continues until one person has no spots remaining at the beginning of his turn.&#10;&#10;"

If a player uses another player's word, that word is taken and given to the player forming the new word. When no new words can be made, each player scores the words in their area.

All the Uskok leaders, including you, were invited to Nehaj, the unconquerable Uskok fortress, in order to choose their next Warlord.&#10;&#10;Dark storm clouds loomed over the stone fortress, its walls battered by the bitter nothern gales, and yet the Uskok leaders could not come to an agreement. Mighty warriors though they were, none of them had proved to be enough to their comrades, so no Warlord had been chosen. As midnight struck, the debate was cut short by a shot from a flintlock. The hall went silent. The old sea dog Stipe spoke: &quot;According to ancient customs, if no agreement is reached by midnight, the title of Warlord shall go to the first lord who collects enough loot to fill twenty-five Uskok vessels.&quot; So it was written, and so it was done.&#10;&#10;Uskoci were a historical pirate band in the 16th century who lived and prospered by being a nuisance for much more powerful opponents, but never on such a scale to provoke full-scale retaliation.

The more complex game adds card drafting to the mix, with the player who has the least treasure on the table drafting the most cards.&#10;&#10;The rules in both games are for 3-6 players, with modifications that allow two players to go head-to-head.&#10;&#10;"
