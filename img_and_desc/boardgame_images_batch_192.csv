The hex space has numbers at the outer edge and the player must move through a line that matches the number thrown on on of the dice.  This is then repeated for the number shown on the second die.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is for each player to visit each flower once (and collect a colored hive for doing so).&#10;&#10;The player that visits all the flowers first wins.&#10;&#10;

Make them slip on Banana Peels and make them drop a Pie AND miss a turn!!  Lock them out of turnstiles!  Lock them out of bathrooms!  And, of course, your opponents are going to try to do the same to you.  Plus, you&rsquo;ve got to be careful of those turnstiles &ndash; you and your Pies might not fit through them!

It has a 6x6 grid of holes into which 36 playing blocks&mdash;18 dark, 18 light&mdash;can be pushed.  There are two wooden trays for each player to sort their wooden playing blocks.  (When not in use, the pieces, trays, and board are all able to stack on top of each other for display.)  The blocks have one of four different flags painted on either end, always a different flag on each side for a total of six combinations of flags.&#10;&#10;To win the game, a player must create a pattern of flags on his side, the shape of which is to be agreed upon before the game.  It can be a square shape (A) or a flag shape (B):&#10;&#10;AA&#10;AA&#10;&#10;B&#10;--BB&#10;B&#10;&#10;or&#10;&#10;---B&#10;BB&#10;---B&#10;&#10;Typically the flag shape is used, as it is harder to block.  A player&rsquo;s pattern may utilize flags from either player&rsquo;s pieces (the directions the flags point is of no consequence) and the pattern is not affected by any other flags in the board.&#10;&#10;Players take turns choosing their blocks in secret and placing them according to a key painted on the upper right hand corner of each side of the board, pointing the flag on the player&rsquo;s side according to the key in order to remember what flag is on the opposite side.  When either player sees a complete pattern on their own side, they turn the board and the game ends.  A draw can occur if all blocks are played with no pattern completed.  The rules provide for several variations that include bluffing, different goals, pushing blocks out, and different endings.&#10;&#10;"

The game accommodates 2-5 players and plays in roughly 30-60 min (my best guess). Images and rules (in French) are available at the Alchymia website.&#10;&#10;Each player is given a personal board and 3 potion cards and 8 atomic element tokens in 5 colors are placed in the central reserve. Each potion card depicts 1-4 atomic elements used to create the 5 Elemental Crystals (Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Time). Players attempt to collect and place the atomic element tokens on their board in such a way as to mimic the current configuration of one of the 5 crystals. They do this, in turn, by playing a potion card to retrieve an atomic element token of one of the types shown on the card from the central reserve and place it on their game board. They can also choose to remove an element token from their game board by playing a potion card with that element type. Alternatively, players can pass their turn by wiping their board clean of tokens.&#10;&#10;Once a player has matched a crystal configuration, they wipe their board of tokens, collect the crystal structure card they matched, reveal a new crystal configuration card and begin collecting beads for another type of crystal. The twist is that each type of crystal confers upon its owner an additional special power (for example, the Time Crystal allows you to rearrange your board during your turn, instead of taking or removing an element token). The first person to collect each of the 5 crystals becomes the master alchemist who can create the coveted Black Crystal.&#10;&#10;"

The opponent then draws a card with a phrase on it and must list out the number of words and letters with a series of dashes as if it were a game of hangman.  The player then gets to select five letters of the alphabet, which the opponent must write in place in the phrase (if applicable).  The player then gets an opportunity to guess the phrase. If successful, the player gets five points.  If not, the player has the opportunity to select more letters, but decreasing the number of points awarded.  The first player to 20 points wins, and is entitled to cash in a &quot;Fantasy favor&quot; check.&#10;&#10;The phrases range from flirtatious to naughty but manage to avoid obscenity.
