At least that's what they have when they show up instead of leaving the fighting to the Romanians. The Romanian Army has been rebuilt from its 1941 and 1942 disasters, with German-made tanks and modern Romanian-made anti-tank guns. The Germans do provide the elite Grossdeutschland Division, and its epic stand at Tirgu Frumos is a centerpiece of the game&rsquo;s scenario set.&#10;&#10;The Red Army is powerful: the new JS-2 heavy tanks are in action, along with the first examples of the T34/85.

Each class has a specific number of starting dice for basic attack and agility rolls and class specific skill that is unique for each of the eight classes. After players have chosen their class they are tasked with selecting the skills that their character will possess for the duration of the game. There are eight double-sided ability inserts available to each archetype allowing for a total of 24 unique versions of each of the available eight classes. Players then select their portrait and sprite representation for this game.&#10;&#10;Once players have selected their class, abilities, and portrait, the players select the boss they will face at the end of the game.

The first phase is the exploration phase during this phase each hero has 3 exploration actions that they can take. These include things such as moving into a new tile,  scrounging rooms for treasure, equipping items and resting to name a few. After each hero has taken their three exploration actions it is now time for the encounter phase. Random targeting determines where the encounter(s) will be taking place, the hero(es) that have been assigned an encounter will roll the encounter die to determine what they will have to contend with, be it monsters, events or nothing at all. During the encounter phase each hero is allowed one action and the encounter phase does not end until all monsters have been defeated. After the monsters have been dealt with the heroes gain experience and divvy up the treasure.  The &quot;Player One&quot; marker is moved all heroes move their special ability dice closer to the ready and the new player one starts the turn with their three exploration actions.&#10;&#10;The dungeon and all things in it, including the boss, are designed to scale based on the number of heroes playing and the highest level hero in the dungeon. As heroes level up they gain additional attack or agility dice and their special abilities require less of a cool down between uses.&#10;&#10;The base game includes 26 hex tiles, which the heroes reveal as they explore the dungeon. The boss fight is triggered by the random pull of one of these tiles that is labeled &quot;BOSS FIGHT!!!&quot; when this tile is entered all heroes teleport to the tile to do battle with the boss.

To win the game (and get the funds!), you will have to get the most points with this method.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you can perform one or more actions (without repeating any).  The available actions are represented on the control panel board, and you will use scientists and students to trigger them.  Each turn is played in three consecutive steps.  Once you're finished, it&rsquo;s your opponent's turn, and so on until the end of the game.  These are the three steps:&#10;&#10;Action Selection: Choose the actions you want to perform this turn.  First, pick a student from your hand and place in in the control panel, covering the action it&rsquo;s going to perform. Then, use your available scientists to select one or more actions, as explained below.  Note:  you can&rsquo;t repeat the action on a student card.&#10;Action resolution: In whatever order you choose, perform your selected actions, taking back the corresponding scientists and students as you do. Student cards go straight to the discard pile, but you get your scientist team back for next turn.  If you haven&rsquo;t shot the ray this turn, take the extra scientist, aside from your two regular ones.  This additional scientist will help you during your next turn.  If it is already in your possession, and you have shot the ray this turn, put it back, next to the testing room board.&#10;Hiring a new student: Once you have solved all the actions, draw a new student card from the deck.  You will continue drawing cards every turn until the deck is over.  Once the deck is depleted, keep playing your cards from your hand normally.  Once all students have been used (players don&rsquo;t have available student cards in their hands), shuffle the student cards deck to form a new face down pile on the table.  Both players draw two new student cards and continue playing normally.&#10;&#10;SPA&#10;&#10;De uno de los laboratorios m&aacute;s perdidos de la Atomic Biochemistry Brave Academy (ABBA), surge un grito que clama al cielo: &ldquo;&iexcl;Eureka!&rdquo;.  Tras a&ntilde;os de investigaci&oacute;n, el profesor R&ouml;ntgen ha inventado un nuevo cachivache que parece ser capaz de modificar la composici&oacute;n at&oacute;mica de los objetos, hasta el punto de poder reducirlos y aumentarlos a su antojo.  Pero los bajos fondos del mundo cient&iacute;fico son repugnantes y su &quot;colega&quot;, archienemigo y antiguo alumno suyo, el profesor Stern, est&aacute; decidido a robarle la idea. Y es que en los pr&oacute;ximos d&iacute;as se determina qu&eacute; departamento obtiene la subvenci&oacute;n de la academia para continuar con su trabajo, as&iacute; que la seguridad de los experimentos se ha convertido en algo secundario.  Ambos profesores deben emplear a sus estudiantes eficientemente para tratar de obtener los resultados m&aacute;s espectaculares posibles, mientras tratan de sabotear discretamente a su rival.&#10;&#10;Para conseguir las mejores muestras experimentales, debes utilizar el rayo para manipular el valor y el tama&ntilde;o de los dados de tu color, a la vez que saboteas a tu oponente modificando los suyos.  Contra mayor sea el valor de un dado y menor sea su tama&ntilde;o, m&aacute;s puntos otorga al jugador de ese color. Para ganar la partida (&iexcl;y hacerte con la subvenci&oacute;n!), tendr&aacute;s que ser t&uacute; el que consiga m&aacute;s puntos de este modo.&#10;&#10;Durante tu turno puedes realizar una o m&aacute;s acciones (sin repetir ninguna). Las acciones disponibles est&aacute;n representadas en el tablero a modo de cuadro de mandos, y para realizarlas necesitas emplear cient&iacute;ficos y estudiantes.  Los turnos se juegan en tres pasos consecutivos. Cuando los termines, le toca jugar a tu oponente y os ir&eacute;is turnando as&iacute; hasta que acabe la partida. Los pasos son los siguientes:&#10;&#10;1.       Selecci&oacute;n de acciones: Selecciona las acciones a realizar. Elige un estudiante de tu mano y ponlo en el cuadro de mandos, de forma que tape la acci&oacute;n correspondiente. A continuaci&oacute;n, emplea a tus cient&iacute;ficos para seleccionar una o m&aacute;s acciones, seg&uacute;n el caso, como se explica m&aacute;s abajo. Nota:  no puedes repetir la acci&oacute;n de la carta de estudiante.&#10;2.       Resoluci&oacute;n de acciones: En el orden que desees, resuelve cada una de las acciones seleccionadas, retirando al hacerlo al estudiante o cient&iacute;ficos correspondientes. Las cartas de estudiante retiradas van a al mazo de descarte, pero los cient&iacute;ficos los recuperas para tu siguiente turno. Si no has disparado en este turno, adem&aacute;s de tus 2 cient&iacute;ficos, coge tambi&eacute;n al cient&iacute;fico extra, que te ayudar&aacute; durante el turno siguiente. Si ya lo ten&iacute;as y en este turno has disparado, devu&eacute;lvelo.&#10;3.       Reclutar un nuevo estudiante: Una vez resueltas las acciones, roba una nueva carta. Deber&aacute;s seguir robando al final de cada turno hasta que se acabe el mazo de robo.  Una vez se acabe el mazo de robo, seguir&aacute;s jugando con las cartas que te queden en la mano. Cuando se haya empleado a todos los estudiantes (no tengas cartas en la mano), vuelve a barajar los estudiantes para formar un nuevo mazo de robo y robad dos cartas cada uno, para continuar normalmente.&#10;&#10;"

In both cases, each player takes command of two armies or associations operating. It receives the relevant boards of the army and pools chips and card deck of cards generals of staff. For the game on the board influenced these cards staff, especially the generals who lead our armies into battle. At the beginning of the game we have such a scenario which determines - that is suitable for autumn 1914, during the game we can not change them. Generals have characteristics that affect the gameplay. The most important is an initiative of deciding on the order of execution of commands the army and orders, informing us how many orders we can spread the chips on the board. Cards and indicate how many cards of Staff tighten at the beginning of each turn. These factors can be modified by other cards of Staff, which assign the army (up to 3 cards), putting them on these boards army generals next card. In addition, staff can use the card in a different way - by playing them as an action during your turn or turn another player. The applied procedure allows us to influence the strength and mobility of the army, and thus develop their own, each time another strategy. Cards staff played as stocks allow us to accelerate the arrival of reinforcements such as on the board, or on the contrary force the opponent deploy the neighboring front of any of several units.&#10;&#10;The game consists of six or eight turns, and each of the four phases. The first three are played simultaneously by all players. In the preparation phase we select the appropriate number of cards, we draw card of weather, check supplies, we join the army staff card or change the generals at their stations. In the phase of aviation spread the chips on the board planes that make us the third phase. This is the instruction phase, in which we place our units orders - march, spread, defend, retreat, reorganization, support, or crossing. If the field with our units appeared aircraft orders, we must spread face up - in a transparent manner. It was not until the fourth and final phase of motion play as an initiative of the cards generals - from highest to lowest. We then move orders or spread. If you meet the armies opposing players battle occurs. This is to be decided on the basis of the points of strength and modifiers. The final outcome of the battle can affect tightens card battle.

This refers to the different relationships each element has with the others according to their dominance, opposition and weakness.&#10;&#10;Fire (Ashw) dominates over Earth (Ohif), opposes Air (Ukelele) and is weak against Water (Esbner).&#10;&#10;Water (Esbner) dominates over Fire (Ashw), opposes Earth (Ohif) and is weak against Air (Ukelele).&#10;&#10;Air (Ukelele) dominates over Water (Esbner), opposes Fire (Ashw) and is weak against Earth (Ohif).&#10;&#10;Earth (Ohif) dominates over Air (Ukelele), opposes Water (Esbner) and is weak against Fire (Ashw).&#10;&#10;The objective of this game scenario is to be the first to discard all your cards in your CURRENT HAND. The recommended numbers playing the game will be 2, 3, 4 and 6 who will be distributed with 18, 12, 9 and 6 cards respectively from a shuffled STANDARD DECK.&#10;&#10;Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved. The starting player may lay down any 1 card from his/her hand into a common pool in front of all players.&#10;&#10;During each turn, each player may EITHER 1) play a card whose FACE VALUE is higher than the previous card; 2) play a card whose ELEMENT dominates the ELEMENT of the previous card; 3) pass and the turn goes to the next player.&#10;&#10;Each time a player plays a card whose ELEMENT dominates the ELEMENT of the previous card, each player MUST choose a card from his/her CURRENT HAND and pass it to the player on the left.&#10;&#10;In the situation when the game cannot go on as players can no longer put down cards due to the rules, the player with the least cards of the smallest number wins.&#10;&#10;"

Now Cypher is fighting the corporations themselves for control of the nexus.&#10;&#10;In Cypher, players take on the role of factions that are gathering characters from all spheres of influence &mdash; from corporate overseers to street level hackers &mdash; in order to dominate Cypher and seize control of the nexus.
