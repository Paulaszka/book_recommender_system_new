10745,,"Lucky Chess is a card-based chess variant.  The cards are divided into decks based on which type of piece they apply to, and on your turn you draw one.  This indicates from where (rank or file) you are allowed to move a piece, or whether or not you must make a capture.&#10;&#10;The rules for three players involve two boards with a single White player and two Black players - White makes the same move on both boards simultaneously if possible.&#10;&#10;"

10747,,"Doublethink is based on a puzzle, namely to place three copies each of eleven letters (those in &quot;Doublethink,&quot; naturally) on a figure consisting of three concentric circles joined by eleven radial lines so that every letter is connected to every other one exactly once.&#10;&#10;When played as a two-player game, each player gets fifteen letter chips (the remaining three being placed on the board) and places one at a time in an effort to form connections and make it impossible for the opponent's chips to be placed.  A player scores a point for each connection he or she makes and also for each connection the opponent is prevented from making.  The score can be read from an erasable board (the game also includes a pen) which tracks the connections made for each letter.&#10;&#10;"

10749,,"Ingenuity is an interesting attempt from an obscure Israeli company at a Mastermind/Black Box type deduction game (where one player sets up a puzzle and the other solves it) with a murder mystery theme.&#10;&#10;The setter decides which of the 8 characters was murdered, who killed him or her, and with what weapon.  Clues to these elements are attached to the characters (for example, whether the killer was male or female, a family member or servant, etc.) and the pieces placed on the board.  The murderer can have a false clue.&#10;&#10;The solving player moves a detective figure around the board (which shows the floor plan of a small mansion and garden) encountering characters and looking at their clues.  The setter gets turns to move characters to get away (presumably) from the detective.  The object is to solve the mystery in as few turns as possible - as in other games of this type it is always played twice, with the roles reversed for the second game.&#10;&#10;The pieces really make the game - the characters are large Lucite blocks with simple pictures on the fronts and metal circles on the backs - the clues are on small magnets which attach to the circles.  In addition, a piece of red plastic is provided to serve as the pool of blood in which the victim is found.&#10;&#10;"

To catch Geists, you need to lure them with an exact number of Zingiberi chips. These are earned by moving around the board and landing on numbered squares. The number lets you take or return a chip of that value, but also determined how far you will move next turn. A clever movement system encourages people to cheat and get away with it, or at least makes everyone watch closely. Each Geist, once captured, can also be use to &quot;prank&quot; other players, and this keeps things rowdy but also adds to the strategy. Chili Pepper cards also spice things up since the Geists don't usually like them.&#10;&#10;"

The equipment consists of a deck of (seemingly homemade but fairly sturdy) cards and a cloth bag.  The cards include a group of times, a number of opportunity cards (all identical), a group of motives (all with appropriate quotes, e.g. &quot;Love and murder will out. - William Congreve&quot; for the Love card), &quot;You Are Murdered&quot; cards, and 10 sets of actual murder cards, each set containing an alias, method, weapon, and place - for example, Archbishop, Ran Over, Car, and Avenue.&#10;&#10;Each player gets a You Are Murdered card and a random assortment of others, and in turn takes a card and discards one into the bag.

Play uses a standard deck of 52 cards.  Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.&#10;&#10;The bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.&#10;&#10;Play begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.&#10;&#10;Points are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.&#10;&#10;Both teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go &quot;set&quot; and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.&#10;&#10;Another option to bidding played in some areas is to &quot;shoot the moon.&quot; Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Another version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.&#10;&#10;There are four possible points in a hand:&#10;&#10;High: highest trump card in play &#10;Low: lowest trump card in play; this point is retained by the team that played it regardless of who takes the trick&#10;Jack: Jack of trump, if in play&#10;Game: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.&#10;&#10;&#10;        Variant - 6 point pitch: Jokers Add in high and low Jokers for a point each if in play. Their strength is between Jack and 10. They are always considered to be in the trump suit&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Starting at the dealer's left, each player has one chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.&#10;&#10;If you bid and don't make it, you go down that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.&#10;&#10;After the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.&#10;&#10;The player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.&#10;&#10;First team to 21 points wins.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jersey Pitch&quot; adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.&#10;&#10;"

10796,,"From Bruno Faldetti's Review:&#10;&#10;The name sounds like a Japanese war cry, and the game looks a bit like Go. With its large square box and its flat black box, Ooyoo could have been one of these strange games that we used to look with eagerness and curiosity in the Impens&eacute; Radical bookshop, in Paris, in the late seventies and early eighties. Yes, I know I'm getting old. Nothing oriental though in this game, since the exotism is fake, and author and publisher both German.&#10;&#10;Ooyoo, however, is what it looks like : a simple and subtle strategy game, with three lines of rules, that could well become a classic. Like in Halma or Chinese Checkers, each player starts in a corner of the board and tries to bring all his stones in the opposite corner. The trick is in the simple and original movement rule : stones can only move by pair, two adjacent stones moving one space in the same direction. This makes for various blocking and turning strategies, especially since each player has an uneven number of stones, and can't move backwards in his own half of the board.&#10;&#10;Ooyoo is much more subtle than Chinese Checkers, but doesn't pretend to be as deep and as Go - the similarity is mostly in the overall look. This excellent strategy game deserves to become a modern classic, along with Twixt, Focus or Lines of Action, and can also make for a nice and slightly lighter change for Go or Chess players.

10799,,"Old Maid is a traditional children's game. You can buy a deck of cards designed for the game, but it can be easily played with a standard deck of cards:&#10;&#10;Throw away all but one of the queens from the deck. You won't use the &quot;extra queens&quot; during play. (You may also want to throw out all black cards or all red cards to speed up the game). Deal all the cards out to the players. Players put down any pairs they have, then keep the rest of their cards in their hand, hidden from their opponents. From here on, take turns; on your turn, draw a card from any other player. If you made a pair, then put it down.&#10;&#10;In the end, all cards except the &quot;old maid&quot; (the one queen left in the deck) will be down in pairs. Whoever holds that card loses! Everybody else wins!&#10;&#10;The best part of this game is seeing another player draw the old maid away from you. You're supposed to keep it a secret when this happens (because other players will avoid drawing from the victim if they know that they risk the old maid by doing so), but young children usually laugh or gloat when the old maid gets taken from them. Adults playing can make the victim feel better by trying to draw the maid away from them.&#10;&#10;"

The cards show different types of fish in different sizes, from hungry to full. Players draw cards and play them to rows, with hungry fish eating everything in front of it until it meets a like fish. A fish doesn't eat its like, and instead goes to the table as a fat fish. When a player has drawn 3 cards of a kind, it can take a fat fish from the table. When the round ends, players score for the most fish in their catch.&#10;&#10;Reportedly a good, quick filler, with English and French rules in the box (only in the Abacus Edition, the SimplyFun Edition has only English rules).&#10;&#10;"

In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.&#10;&#10;A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is get a total close to - but not over - 21 and have that total be more than the dealer's total.&#10;&#10;The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others).&#10;&#10;Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations.
