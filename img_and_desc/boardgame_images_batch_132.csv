15042,,"Game features one 22x34 map, 600 counters and a 56 Page rulebook and a 48 page scenario book.  Scale is 15-40 miles a hex, each turn is 2 weeks, units are ships, divisions and brigades.&#10;&#10;One of the very few games to cover both the land and naval aspects of the War in the Desert in World War Two. This is a Japanese game with translated rules.&#10;&#10;Buyer caution:  all rules I have seen are poor copies and somewhat hard to read.&#10;&#10;"

15044,,"Inchon depicts the Korean War's most famous battle, the U.S. and South Korean amphibious landings that led to the liberation of Seoul and, coupled with the defeat of the last North Korean assault on the Pusan Perimeter, turned the tide of the war (until, that is, Communist China intervened in force). The map scale is 1.7 kilometers per hex. The game lasts 12 turns that evidently equate to days. Units are companies and armored platoons for the U.S./ROK, mostly battalions for North Korea (whose army the rulebook consistently calls by its Korean name, &quot;In Min Gun&quot; or &quot;IMG&quot;). Higher level headquarters units implement the game's (rather restrictive and cumbersome) command rules.&#10;&#10;The components are typical of Simulations Canada: a plain but functional two-color map, simple counters and a small, tightly printed rulebook. U.S. Marine and Army counters are shades of green, South Korean shades of red, North Korean a uniform brown. Counters are one-sided, with the back giving setup or arrival information for the historical scenarios.&#10;&#10;The U.S./ROK side earns victory points by seizing objectives in and around Seoul, the enemy by inflicting casualties. As alternatives to the historical setup and reinforcement schedules, the U.S./ROK may use a free setup, or the IMG may receive more rapid reinforcements.&#10;&#10;Game turns are divided into &quot;impulses&quot;, a concept borrowed from White Death, a Frank Chadwick design. In each of its impulses, a side may use all or some of its 9 &quot;movement points&quot; (but always at least one). The impulses alternate until all movement points are exhausted or neither player wants to do anything further that turn. The system is attractive in principle but may bog down in practice. It also requires record keeping, as air, naval and artillery units may bombard only once per turn rather than once per impulse.&#10;&#10;Although all units have the same 9 movement points, how far they in fact can go differs by type - tracked vehicle, foot, support (wheeled vehicle) or &quot;irregular&quot; - and by morale class. If, for instance, a player divides his turn into three impulses, an &quot;A&quot; class armored platoon can potentially move 45 hexes along a road, while &quot;C&quot; class infantry company could advance 9 at most. Higher class units are also less likely to break in combat and can operate effectively at a greater distance from their HQ's. Out-of-supply units are slowed down. Those suppressed by bombardment may not move at all.&#10;&#10;According to the designer's notes, &quot;In the historic scenario most play-tests ended with the UN player getting most of his objectives, though about half the time he was not able to secure the Seoul capital hex in time. As a result the game usually turned on how high a casualty level was sustained to get these objectives. . . . In the various Free UN landing and Rapid IMG reinforcement scenarios playtests indicated just about anything could happen.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

15055,,"The colorful board is divided into 64 (8x8) squares in 16 different colors, 4 squares of each color. The players take turns placing one of their four pawns on any unoccupied square of any color.&#10;&#10;After the set-up phase the pawns move like chess rooks, i. e. any number of squares in a straight line onto an empty square, without capturing or jumping over another pawn. Whoever places his four pawns on the four squares of a single color wins the game.&#10;&#10;The title Bl&ouml;ff, a variant German spelling of &quot;Bluff&quot;, refers to the distracting nature of the board - the rules advise keeping your opponent in the dark about your desired winning combination.&#10;&#10;FINESSE - rules of the game&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;The playing board is marked into sixty four squares of sixteen different colors. These are joined by lines to show the directions in which the pieces can move. Four orange or four red pieces are used by each player.&#10;&#10;Playing the game:&#10;Red begins by placing one piece on the board on any square. Orange does the same. Each player takes turns to place his men. When the eight pieces are on the board the moves can start. A player may move his piece along any line, in any direction, as far as he wishes to provided no other piece is jumped over.&#10;Each player takes turns to move a piece, and this continues until one player has all four pieces on squares which are all the same color.&#10;&#10;Tactics:&#10;It is important to try and prevent your opponent from guessing the color of the squares you are trying to capture. If you are trying for one color and you think your opponent has guessed this, you can change your mind and try to capture another color.&#10;&#10;&#10;FINESSE - r&egrave;gles du jeu&#10;&#10;Joueurs et accessoires:&#10;Une partie r&eacute;unit deux joueurs qui disposent d'un tableau et de quatre pions chacun. La couleur des pions, rouge ou orange, est attribu&eacute;e &agrave; chaque joueur avant le d&eacute;but de la partie.&#10;&#10;But du jeu:&#10;Le gagnant sera celui qui parviendra le premier, &agrave; disposer ses quatre pions sur quatre cases de m&ecirc;me couleur.&#10;&#10;D&eacute;but et d&eacute;roulement de la partie:&#10;Les pions rouges commencent. A tour de r&ocirc;le chacun place un pion a sa guise sur une case de couleur libre. Lorsque tous les pions sont pos&eacute;s, on les d&eacute;place d'une case a une autre, dans n'importe quelle direction d'une ou plusieurs cases. On ne peut pas sauter un pion (le sien ou celui de l'adversaire), ni prendre plusieurs directions a la fois.&#10;&#10;Un dernier conseil:&#10;Dissimulez aussi longtemps que possible la couleur que vous convoitez !

15059,,"This is an old Swedish game seeking to simulate the beautiful and sometimes harsh sport of orienteering. It's not a very accurate simulation (or perhaps the runners are not very skilled). To win the game you must visit a number of checkpoints in a specified order and get to the goal before the other players. The game board is basically an ordinary orienteering map with an overlayed grid.&#10;&#10;To move, you roll three dice. One is an ordinary D6 that tells how far you can run this turn and the other two gives the directions that you can choose from. The direction dice both have three blank sides and the other three sides have directions N, S, NS and E, W, EW respectively. If you are running along a road or river or other distinct feature of the landscape you ignore the direction dice. If not, you have to combine and choose one direction from the direction dice (if both dice are blank you can run any way you like, not necessarily only in one direction).&#10;&#10;This game was published in the 1940s.&#10;&#10;"

15070,,"Slaughterloo is the game of massed armies involving the world of Valon, the fantasy world of Flintloque.  The game includes two volumes, the Rulebook and the Army Lists, as well as character figures for the Orc/British leader and the Elf/French leader, as well as dice and command cards needed for play.&#10;&#10;You will need to put together your armies from the fantasy Napoleonic line produced by Alternative Armies for this and Flintloque/Deadloque.  While I bought it to play the game, I found it was very handy for Flintloque players as it contains a much more complete background on the world of Valon, as well as details on the uniforms of the different armies and races of the fantasy world.  Lots of photographs in color and black &amp; white give the player lots of details to help paint their units.  There is also a sample game with color photographs showing each phase and turn of a game to demonstrate the rules in action over a period of three turns.  The game recommends minimum units of divisions, made up of an average of 3 infantry units (around 20 figures each), one cavalry unit (of around 10 figures) and one artillery unit (one or two guns with crews, limbers, etc.), but suggests that each player can control a corps of 2 divisions.  I believe that you could play to learn the rules with just 2 or 3 units as you build your armies.

Last can quickly become first, as when someone has attained a new innovation, it can quickly be shared with the rest of the collective through visits and the cultural exchanges that result!&#10;&#10;---&#10;&#10;bolo' bolo is game designer / Anarchist P.M.'s second foray into political board games, with his first being the cult tile laying favourite Demono. bolo' bolo is based upon the book of the same name which lays out P.M.'s ideal society based upon sub-communities, each autonomous, with an economy fueled by trade.&#10;&#10;Game components are in both German and French, and are rather archaic with the 'cards' being coloured paper with black ink style drawings, absolutely nothing like Demono's more lush visuals.&#10;&#10;The basic idea of the title is that each player represents one of the &quot;bolos&quot; on the board, each of which specialises in the production of certain things, and which needs certain others, which is accomplished via trade.&#10;&#10;"

On his turn, a player moves the number of spaces he spun on the spinner.  If he ends his move on a space with a face-down animal tile, he guesses what kind of animal is shown on the other side of the tile.  He then turns it over to see if his guess was correct.  If so, he gets to take another turn.  Some spaces show the silhouette of an animal.  If a player ends his move on one of these spaces, he can move ahead one extra space if he can correctly identify the animal shown in the silhouette.&#10;&#10;"

15118,,"Very similar to Liar's Dice.  Instead of rolling dice, players are dealt cards with poker hands on them.  Examples:  Jack-high hand, a pair of sevens, four queens.  There are no straights, flushes, or full houses, only a specified card and the number of copies of that card in the hand.  Each player is dealt the same number of cards (1 - 7).  Players then bid on the combined hands of all players.  A player that bids seven kings is betting that there will be seven or more kings total in everyone's hands.  To bid, each player must bid either a higher number of matching cards, or the same number of a higher ranked cards.  (So, to overbid seven kings, bid seven aces, or eight or more of anything.)  When players think someone has bid more than the cards will support, they call &quot;liar&quot;.  Once everyone around the table has called &quot;liar&quot; rather than keep bidding, the cards are shown.  If someone is called a liar, but the cards prove him right, he wins the pot of chips accumulated during the bidding.  If he loses, the chips remain in the pot for the next hand.&#10;&#10;"

GUNS! Artillery pieces. Anti-tank guns. The famous and deadly German &quot;88&quot;. Mortars and bazookas! ASLSK#2 adds the &quot;to hit&quot; procedure to the foundation you learned in ASLSK#1. And if you didn't get ASLSK#1? There are two &quot;infantry only&quot; scenarios to get you up to speed!&#10;&#10;This answers the inevitable question we get with the Starter Kit concept. Do I need ASLSK#2 if I have ASLSK#1? The Starter Kits are self contained. Each has everything you need to play what's in the box, with the higher numbers adding to the ASL knowledge you'll have from playing previous Starter Kits. We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#2 adds about 4 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1). A better question would be &quot;Do I need ASLSK#1 if I buy ASLSK#2?&quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#2.
