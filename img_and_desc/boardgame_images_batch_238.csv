Each main personality character usually has three levels, to a maximum of five. Throughout the game, the main personality can get stronger via gaining anger, replacing the previous version played.&#10;&#10;Decks are divided into seven different styles: Blue, Red, Orange, Black, Saiyan, Namekian and Free-Style. Each style focuses on a different aspect of combat. For instance, the Red style focuses on gaining anger, while the Namekian style focuses on life and energy. If a player uses nothing but one color or style in his or her deck, the player would be able to declare a Tokui-waza at the start of the game, allowing various benefits, such as certain cards allowing additional powers, as stated in the card's text box.&#10;&#10;Later expansions allowed you to play Mastery cards that allowed abilities that always stayed in play. Sensei cards were also eventually introduced, allowing for sideboards to cater against one's opponent.&#10;&#10;There are three ways to win the game. First is to reduce your opponent's deck to zero cards. Second is to win via having the most powerful personality, via gaining anger. This win condition may sometimes be not available, depending on who one's main personality is. Third is to play or capture, all seven Dragon Balls. Again, this win condition may sometimes be unavailable, depending on how decks are constructed.&#10;&#10;The bulk of the Dragon Ball Z CCG focuses on combat. Players alternate as attacker and defender. Attacks are divided into physical and energy attacks. Physical attacks reduce the opponent's power levels, eventually dealing life damage. Energy attacks deal damage directly, but usually costs two power levels to perform. Players must strike a balance between offense and defense, as cards are discarded from one's deck upon taking damage, making it possible for a certain card to be discarded from play, even before being used.&#10;&#10;The game was criticized to be highly random and greatly dependent on having better cards than one's opponent, as opposed to simply being the better player. Nonetheless, the tournament scene was quite popular during the game's existence, and the secondary market remains strong even after the game has died out.&#10;&#10;"

Typically played in Casinos, several standard decks of 52 cards are shuffled together and dealt from a communal card shoe.&#10;&#10;All three variants operate on the same principle; 2 cards are dealt in alternating order to a hand designated as the Player, and a hand designated as the Banker. Typically the Player hand is played by the person who bet the most on the Player's hand to win. Depending on the variant being played, certain circumstances allow either participant to draw an extra card then the cards are totaled (2s through 9s are worth their face value while 10s and face cards are worth ten points and aces are worth one point). If the total of a hand's cards exceed 10 points, the tens digit is dropped. The hand with a total closest to 9 wins and neither hand wins in the event of a tie.&#10;&#10;Punto Banco is the most common variant in North America, but requires no skill and operates solely on chance. Typically played in Casinos, the house always plays the Banker hand (although players may still bet on that hand to win). It is usually played with eight (8) decks of cards shuffled together.&#10;&#10;Conversely, Baccarat Banque and Baccarat Chemin de Fer (more common in Europe) allow the players to make choices during the game so a player's skill can affect the outcome. In either of these variants a player may choose to play the Banker himself and the other players play against his 'Bank' (supply of money). In Baccarat Chemin de Fer, the Bank passes when the Banker loses a hand. In Baccarat Banque, a player may remain the Banker so long as he still has funds or until all cards in the shoe have been dealt. Baccarat Banque is typically played with 3 decks of cards while Baccarat Chemin de Fer is typically played with 6. In most cases these variants are played completely in French even in English-speaking areas.&#10;&#10;Since the Banker has a slight edge over the Player in his chances of winning a hand, the house taxes all winning Banker bets when played in a casino (typically 5%).&#10;&#10;"

Every player starts with 100 points. Every round starts with point bidding to get the start player token. The start player can break ties and chooses tasks the players are bidding for. Tasks like &quot;get the most tricks&quot; or &quot;get the most coins&quot;. There are two tasks per player and four cards which you'll get with the task cards. There are three types of cards: coins, charms, and mojos. Every round one player plays a card and the other players must play a higher card with the same symbol. The player with the highest card of the played symbol gets all played cards and wins the trick. The first player to reach 200 points wins.&#10;&#10;"
