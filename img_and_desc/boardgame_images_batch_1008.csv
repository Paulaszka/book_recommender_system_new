The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannh&auml;user for ranged attacks and area effects.&#10;&#10;The game includes a new battlefield with a brand new mechanism, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Zoe van Dijk and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Instant cards are special because they can be played at any time. They can strengthen, weaken, or redirect an attack to another player.

Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.&#10;&#10;For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.&#10;&#10;Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and outthink them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.&#10;&#10;With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone elses. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;King of the West' card game set 2: The Mavericks, including The Marshall, The Bartender, The Wolf, and their locations.&#10;&#10;"

Rearrange your letters until you come up with a word. Be sneaky and choose a word that your opponent won&rsquo;t easily guess.&#10;&#10;Write it down, keep it a secret. Rescramble your tiles, pass them to your opponent. The goal is to examine your opponent&rsquo;s tiles and try to figure out their word. You do this with Clue Cards. These tell you things such as: what&rsquo;s the first letter, how long&rsquo;s the word, or what does it rhyme with? You win by using as FEW of these clue cards as possible to figure out what word your opponent wrote down.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s thoughtful, strategic, highly-replayable, and built specifically for two players. It&rsquo;s not a game about having the mightiest vocabulary - it&rsquo;s a game about making clever choices.&#10;&#10;The longest, most complicated word isn&rsquo;t always the best choice. Sometimes, picking a smaller, common word is better because your brainiac opponent will overthink things and blaze right past it. Trying to figure out your opponent&rsquo;s secret word can be both hilarious and (delightfully) maddening.

Utilizing a unique spiral gameboard inspired by the ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (previously reconstructed and released by the same game designer, Zach Horton), Supernova requires you to make tough choices, as all of your ships must share the same energy allotment, and it is never enough to power them all at once.&nbsp; The more you power, the fewer Boost Points each one receives, restricting its maneuverability.&nbsp; This is a high-stakes tradeoff, as the star's gravity pulls all of your ships ever closer. You'll need to boost your orbits to keep from burning up.&#10;&#10;Ships move in a counterclockwise spiral toward the star at the center, while the star releases energy bursts (cubes) that travel clockwise toward the edges of the board.&nbsp; The core of the game lies in the interactions between the energy cubes and ships as they collide.&nbsp; Different types of cubes behave differently, but all are dangerous and all are valuable if you can capture them.&nbsp; Clear and yellow cubes can be stored and used as energy to perform special actions, while yellow and red cubes count as victory points at the end of the game.&nbsp; These energy cubes serve as your primary obstacles, primary goal, in-game currency, and victory points.&#10;&#10;Players take turns deciding how many ships to power and then moving each one according to both gravity and Boost Points.&nbsp; Ships can form special formations to help protect them, block your opponents, and collect energy cubes.&nbsp; After players have taken their turns, each round ends with a &quot;star action&quot; that moves the cubes on the board and releases new ones.&nbsp; The sequence of star actions is determined by randomly drawing cards when you set up the game.&nbsp; Thus every game is completely different.&nbsp; Players can only see the star cards for the current and next rounds, and therefore have limited information about future conditions.&nbsp; Despite this element of long-term uncertainty, however, there is no other luck in the game.&nbsp; Players have complete control over the outcomes of their actions.&#10;&#10;Supernova is relatively easy to play, but exceptionally difficult to master, as it asks you to think in spiral rather than linear geometry.&nbsp; The game's mechanics offer many possible ways to achieve your goals, but far more options become available when you begin to work with rather than against the spiral: sometimes the most efficient path from A to B is the long way around...&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
