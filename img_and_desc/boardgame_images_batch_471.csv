It is a two-player (or multi-player) strategic / operational wargame of low-to-medium complexity.&#10;&#10;Units in Proud Monster Deluxe are typically divisions with some corps, brigades and regiments also included. Hexes are 20 miles (about 33 kilometers) across, and each turn represents about a 2 week period.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game systemIn addition to updated graphics, the major changes are Reserves and Reserve Movement phases to simulate the potential for encirclement or defensive reaction. Soviet first winter offensive rules allow the Soviets to retake parts of Russia in early 1942 as happened in history. Both sides now have offensive supply markers to show historical offensive potential and limitations. Innovative weather chits allow for weather variation without extreme weather swings biasing the game. AFV units become even more important due to AFV combat shift. Close Combat option allows for use of an alternate loss procedure and attacker advance to form a jointly-occupied hex, for example, to simulate Stalingrad's gradual fall to the Axis. The ability to fully exploit holes created by mobile assaults is limited to reserves.&#10;&#10;The Axis forces degrade in capability over time while the Soviet forces upgrade in capability. The Axis super heavy artillery Thor and Odin, Heavy Gustav and Dora can fire before combat resolution. Besides the 1941 Free setups, 1941 historical setups are provided for both sides as well as a 1942 scenario. Seasonal offensive rules allow for special turns when special things can happen. The 2 sides show a greater disparity in capability, the Axis can do things the Soviets cannot do and vice versa. Things that work when playing the Axis may not work when playing the Soviets and vice versa.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game componentsGame components have all been improved over the originals. All graphics have been completely updated and upgraded. Counters are 9/16&quot; and map hexes have ample space to avoid players from knocking over those stacks of counters when the fighting starts to tighten up. The four (4) maps impress upon the players the enormous expanse of the Soviet Union and the challenge for both sides to defend and overcome it. Rules are consolidated from the two original sources into one comprehensive set, with all known errata folded in, and a number of important rule changes to improve game balance and playability. In addition, the development of a definitive set of player aids will keep players playing the game instead of hunting down items in the rules.&#10;&#10;    4 maps - each map is 22&quot;x34&quot; with overlap&#10;    10 full sheets of 9/16&quot; counters (2052 counters), printed both sides:&#10;    1 rules book&#10;    12 Full color player aid charts and tables cards printed both sides on cardstock&#10;&#10;    2 Sequence of Play/Combat Result Table&#10;    2 Unit description Chart/Combat Summary&#10;    Axis setup charts: 1941 Free/1941 Historical/1942 (double page)&#10;    Soviet setup charts: 1941 Free/1941 Historical/1942 (double page)&#10;    Axis Turn record Track (double page)&#10;    Soviet Turn record Track (double page)&#10;    Axis Combat Boxes&#10;    Soviet Combat Boxes&#10;    Axis Reserve Boxes&#10;    Soviet Reserve Boxes&#10;&#10;&#10;2 6 sided dice&#10;    1 full color box and lid&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website and user's description)&#10;&#10;"

It is a custom that the game should start with a move from the Blue team and to proceed among the players of the teams in clockwise fashion. At the beginning of the match the board has no pieces and the two teams have all their pieces yet to be played respectively.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Each player on his turn can make only one of these operations:&#10;&bull;    Place of a piece;&#10;&bull;    Move of a piece;&#10;&bull;    Pass the turn.&#10;&#10;CONCLUSION:&#10;The match ends when all pieces have been placed and, therefore, the teams cannot make further moves. Interestingly, one of the teams will finish it&rsquo;s pieces before the other team and so can only make the movement (or pass) waiting for the opponent team to finish its remaining pieces. This phase is called the closure of the game. During the closure the team with pieces cannot move or pass.&#10;&#10;"

Hence, they named their first colony there Murmansk. The end of the Earth.&#10;&#10;To the Allied sailors of many nations who sailed there during WW2 it certainly seemed to live up to its name. Getting there was bad enough with all the hardships of freezing cold conditions, massive storms, and seas that could swallow up a ship leaving little trace. If forced to abandon ship in such waters they were under no illusions that they chances of survival were slim. There were some remarkable stories of survival but the privations endured by those who made it back alive were just as remarkable in that there were so few who lived to tell the tale of being sunk on the Murmansk run.&#10;&#10;Of course, although the port facilities available were Spartan and poorly equipped to handle the huge amount of stores delivered, then there was the problem of getting such cargoes there in the first place.&#10;&#10;Having arrived, there were almost no amenities for the crews of ships to use in order to rest up after fighting there way to Murmansk. Indeed the Soviets were reluctant to give the crews much freedom to go ashore at all. Food was scarce. That supplied was grudgingly given, boring and lacking nutrition. So for those who had arrived, the long wait until they could join a convoy back to the UK was like a prison sentence. Perhaps the only thing the Russians seemed to have plenty of was Vodka and with that they could be extremely generous.&#10;&#10;Join the thriving community around this intensely popular war game.&#10;&#10;Game sclae is of 20cm or 8 inches per nautical mile, so  1cm equals 1 knot.

All this will change according to the year and nationality played, so for 1942 the forces will be different from those of 1945 and also those avaliable to the Royal Navy or the Soviets.&#10;The game has also an event generator to add some flavor, and full tables to calculate combat and the damage and critical hits taken by the diverse forces.&#10;&#10;(From the web publisher Nimble Books LLC)&#10;&#10;"

It takes you into an arena, where champions from faraway lands come to compete and remain the last man standing. By mastering the balance between courage and endurance, you may reap the glory of the INVINCIBLE.&#10;&#10;Players chose their champion from among 3 different tribes, each fielding a variety of 6 *(7) different classes. 18 *(21) unique characters with 2 special abilities each, 3 playing modes for 2-6 *(7) players promises great replay-ability. When designing the rules, our goal was to make them as easy to pick up as checkers, and as tactically deep as chess. From our experience, it is best learned &quot;on the go&quot;, and even first-timers DO win!&#10;&#10;Players have 3 types of card at their disposal. &quot;Action&quot; card with reddish background, &quot;Equipment&quot; cards with yellow background, and &quot;Special&quot; cards with green background. The action cards work on a bit more complex &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; mechanics, and players need to decide which attacks to commence, in order to get their opponent in the spot they want them. Players pick 3 cards from the deck every time it's their turn in the round, or when they are challenged to a duel. At the end of their turn in the round, they may chose to discard one card for their convenience, yet this could also work against them, since the less cards you have on your hand, the more mouth-watering victim you make yourself. Duel is a battle mechanism, where two players engage into an exchange of action cards, where both of them are allowed to use two action cards for an attack, single special card of every kind, use as many equipment cards as they posses, and utilize their special abilities based on the amount of courage they gained in the season. (One whole game of INVINCIBLE represents a season in the arena). Each player's champion has different starting endurance, courage and  card stock based on their tribe of origin. Endurance and courage are two main resources used in the game. Endurance determines how much damage can the player take, and if it drops to zero, the player is eliminated from the competition. However, they are not eliminated from the game. Players who's endurance drops to zero, come back to game in the next turn as &quot;ghost&quot; players. Losing all their equipment and courage, starting with a single point of endurance. Players who are still competing for the title of INVINCIBLE, can no longer duel the ghost players, but this does not work the other way around, and so they may take revenge on their executioners or simply have fun playing with other player's chances in the game. Courage is gained with every successful hit. This means every time you play an attack card, and you duelist does not play a valid defense card against it, that player loses a point of endurance, and you gain a point of courage. Each character has two special abilities, which spent the courage when used. First ability costs 4 courage points, and the other spends 6 points being twice as powerful. Players need to chose whether they spend their courage early, or save up for more powerful abilities and risk that they get eliminated in the process, or somebody uses a card or ability that would steal their courage. The closer to the epic final duel the game gets, the more courage players gain, as every time you eliminate a player, you gain 6 points of courage, and also, there are more equipment cards available for less competing players. Equipment cards improve endurance and courage capacities, and special cads have many uses to disabling your opponents and &quot;resource redistribution&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;    (x) marked values refer to Collector's and Signature editions.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The first board represents the solar system, on which the players' spaceship pawn is moved. If the ship flies off the grid, hits a planet or the sun, the ship is destroyed and all players lose the game. The board also includes Event-markers, which are turned over when the ship flies on them, and have a surprising impact on game play.&#10;The other board represents the inside of the spaceship, where players move their astronaut pawns. Each turn, a player must move from one module of the spaceship to another and carry out an action. The actions that can be carried out in the different modules are:&#10;-Bridge: turn the ship's inclination (to determine which direction the ship moves in)&#10;-Observatory: draw two Data cards (giving points at the end of the game)&#10;-Storage: draw two Equipment cards (useful items to be used during the game to save the ship from destruction or help the player's own game&#10;-Engine room: move the ship pawn forward one step.&#10;&#10;The game has three levels of game play with increasing complexity.

With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.&#10;&#10;As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.&#10;&#10;Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.&#10;&#10;Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules. Strategically, however, it is comparably deep and complex.&#10;&#10;"
