It also covers the early wars of Louis XIV of France up to the end of the 1600s.&#10;&#10;The historical period covered by Close Fire XVII is one of transition from medieval to early-modern warfare marked by the increasing ascendancy of infantry and the transition from pike to shot.&#10;&#10;At the heart of the rule mechanisms is the concept of Disorder Points (DPs). These were invented by Andy Callan for his American War of Independence rules and have proven to be an enduring and elegant way of reflecting the variable state of morale and combat effectiveness. A unit will incur DPs for manoeuvre, receiving fire, close combat and morale, and they will loose them by halting to redress ranks or through the intervention of a leader. The system is easy to use, does not require any paper work and dispenses with the need for lots of morale checks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;extracted description from the rules introduction&#10;&#10;"

Model aircraft of any scale from 1/600th to 1/72nd, can be used. If necessary you could also use card counters. Minimal bookkeeping is required because Markers or Tokens are used to indicate the status of aircraft during the game. Furthermore you do not need to use a hex mat.&#10;&#10;The capabilities of aircraft within the game have been calculated, taking a common aircraft type of average performance as the base line, in this case the Hawker Hurricane. All other aircraft capabilities relate to how they compare with this aircraft. It is possible that the performance of this or that aircraft might not match your expectations based on anecdotal evidence. We make no apology for this as we are not trying to create a simulation. The resulting data has been kept to a simple format, which enables a Player to control several aircraft during a game, and the overall gaming experience will be improved if multiple Players attempt to &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; on each side.&#10;&#10;The abilities of pilots and crew are represented by having Skill Factors. These determine how well they fly their aircraft, their chances of hitting the target when shooting, and avoiding serious damage if their own aircraft is hit. Pilot skill is vitally important in air combat, and Players will need to learn where to position their best pilots, as well as to protect their novice aviators . In the case of aircraft with several crew members, Skill is determined for the crew as a whole. You do not need to keep track of individual crew.&#10;&#10;To carry out any action other than level flight requires the expenditure of one or more Orders, which may also require a successful Skill Test. Orders are generated each turn and better leaders generally mean more Orders. Scenario rules are provided covering simple dogfights during an Encounter, for attacking surface targets, and to represent missions where the aim is to get a force of bombers across the table.&#10;&#10;Altitude represented during the game assumes that the main combat is taking place in roughly the same area of the sky, and it is possible to climb or dive to gain an advantage, or try to escape.&#10;&#10;Players alternate the activation of their aircraft. Optional Tactical Cards can be used during the game to provide additional detail.&#10;&#10;Game Data is provided for most aircraft that saw action during the Second World War. We have not included experimental aircraft or those produced in small numbers.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Long-dormant arcane powers and abilities once believed to be myth suddenly manifested in unsuspecting hosts, while those apparent charlatans who truly had a finger on the pulse of the supernatural unknown found their powers doubled or tripled in strength.&#10;&#10;Creatures that go bump in the night and ancient deities reappeared around the globe to spread terror and destruction. Terrible, enormous, 50-foot-tall monsters with feet the size of automobiles emerged from the oceans, crawled out from crevices, or arrived from outer space for reasons unknown.&#10;&#10;The United Nations formed an elite unit of the best and brightest soldiers and Specialists from around the world to answer this new Kaiju threat. Meanwhile, greed, corruption, and curiosity drove others to arms in an effort to harness the powers awakened by the Rift and cause further chaos while positioning themselves in places of power. Still others suffered such personal loss that vengeance became their only motivator in entering the fight. And others were driven by belief and conviction, the elements of their faith rejuvenated by the powers unleashed by the Rift.&#10;&#10;Now, we stand poised on the edge of extinction. A new status quo must emerge, for the very survival of the human race hangs in the balance.&#10;&#10;What is Kaiju Kaos?&#10;Kaiju Kaos is a tabletop miniatures game where two or more players pit their hand-painted metal and resin armies against one another. Kaiju Kaos is a strategic skirmish game. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of lining up models on the table and the person who goes first is the winner. Kaiju Kaos requires cunning and adaptability because at any time an opponent can drastically alter the current situation with an unexpected action or a lucky roll of the dice. A solid strategy and good implementation combined with a little luck will enable the weakest troopers to bring down the mightiest monster. There are various unnamed troopers and specialists to build armies with, but the true heart of Kaiju Kaos is in the characters &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re human, Kaijin, or colossal Kaiju bent on destroying everything in their path.&#10;&#10;Smackdown is a &ldquo;death match&rdquo; variation of Kaiju Kaos where players quickly battle using one or more 45mm tall character models on a 2x2 foot tabletop. The object of the game is to be the last model standing by defeating your enemies. Every faction in Kaiju Kaos, along with a healthy dose of mercenaries, will be represented in Smackdown.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Spoiler alert! The tank flatters the sailboat!  Each vehicle has a special move that ensures even more mayhem on the field.&#10;&#10;Vehicular Arrangers is a two-player card game that simulates vehicles playing soccer.  The game is played by making simultaneous decisions on each turn.  Those decisions direct players&rsquo; vehicles across a hex grid field.  Some of these decisions will cause vehicles to spin out and crash; others will allow a vehicle to score a goal.  A player wins when they score the most goals before the decks run out of cards.  If tied, players reshuffle, sudden death starts, and the next goal wins.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds.  Players simultaneously assign cards to their vehicles behind a screen and once everyone is ready, they reveal them.  Then they execute the actions of their cards in initiative order among all players. Vehicles will bump other vehicles, vehicles will dribble and kick the ball, and things will lob into the air over other and into other things.&#10;&#10;There are 4 special cards in each player deck that embrace the special properties of each vehicle.

The period covered runs from the late 1950&rsquo;s onwards and allows for the use of aircraft and helicopters.&#10;&#10;The new 2nd edition of the rules has been updated to incorporate our standard A&amp;AGE initiative system, where play alternates between both sides, with the winner of initiative deciding who will move the first unit each turn.&#10;&#10;To represent the uncertainty of modern warfare units on both sides may start the battle as unidentified &ldquo;blips&rdquo; or Contact Markers. Forces with inferior technology may be forced to deploy their units on table, rather than being &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;, while superior forces may have more &ldquo;blips&rdquo; than units, making it more difficult for the enemy to detect where the real units are. A Contact Marker may be detected and become a radar contact, though that must be visually identified before it can be attacked. You can only attack (or be attacked) if your unit has been placed on the table as a model.&#10;&#10;Movement is regulated by means of a system of speed settings, which reflect the maximum and minimum speeds at which the vessel may move in the current turn. The settings may be changed at the end of the turn to plan next turn&rsquo;s movement, and they may also be altered due to damage.&#10;&#10;The Combat system allows for guns and missiles of various types, and resolution is split into a Launch Phase, typically when missiles are fired against enemy targets, and a Combat Phase, where hits by all are resolved and damage inflicted. The subtlety here is that each Phase operates separately, with the order of actions alternating between the players. In the Combat Phase, the active ship does all its direct shooting, but at the end of its actions all incoming missile attacks are resolved against it. Damage it now suffers may mean that any missiles it has launched, and which have not yet been resolved, may become ineffective.&#10;&#10;Damage is recorded in a graded system with 5 states from intact to sunk. It is also possible for vessels to suffer Special Damage, which further degrades their ability to function. There are simple rules for operating helicopters from ships, as well as rules for anti-aircraft fire with guns and missiles.&#10;&#10;We have updated the game set up and introduced a simple points value system for players who want a relatively balanced game. There is also now a system of determining victory or defeat, based on the level of damage each force has suffered. This system represents the effect of damage to valuable assets forcing one or even both sides to retire rather than lose ships.&#10;&#10;There are also additional rules for unconventional craft, mine warfare and operations against coastal targets.&#10;&#10;They are rounded off with extensive data tables for missiles, torpedoes, guns, rockets, SAM systems, Air to Air missiles, ships, helicopters and aircraft. (There are 140 sets of ship data from over 40 countries).&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Bold Made isn&rsquo;t about getting stuck with a card. It&rsquo;s about winning by collecting a team of bold women past and present. Each woman in the deck has made important contributions to her society and to the world at large. The game is fun, of course, but also a powerful way to help kids of both genders find fantastic female role models.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

There are 54 cards with sets of two: a card with the name and illustration of a creature, and then a card with the name + the word poo and an illustration of the type of poo they make. E.g. Rabbit and Rabbit Poo.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with any number of people. It can be played as a matching game for those who can't read, and as a memory game for those who can read.&#10;&#10;For a matching game, the cards are laid out face up and players take turns to try to match animal cards to the corresponding poo cards. If they find a match, they receive an extra turn. The player with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;For a memory game, the cards are laid out face down and players take turns turning over two cards and trying to find a match. If they find a match, they keep the pair and receive an extra turn. If they don't, they flip the cards back over and play passes to the next player. The player with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
