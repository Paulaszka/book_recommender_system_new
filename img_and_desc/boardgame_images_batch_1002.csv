It's a 1 to 5 player cooperative game where all players must work together to share resources to discover recipes to a variety of potions to help you get past tasks inside the tower. Each puppy has a unique magic ability to help their friends but must balance using their own abilities with using those same crystals for potions.&#10;&#10;Puppies have a variety of actions to take on their turn ranging from gathering crystals from a shared stash to discovering or brewing potion recipes. Each puppy also has two unique abilities - a lesser ability can be used an unlimited number of times per game as well as a once per game ultimate ability that will make the puppy's player mat flip and their remaining ability will cost more gems to use for the rest of the game. Discovering potions is vital to puppies' success, and each time a player wants to discover a potion they must use three colors of crystal from in front of them that do not match any other current recipe before flipping over the top potion card. Potions can be be brewed by using the same crystals as are on the recipe card by placing them onto the puppies' current tile. When all potions have been brewed, the puppies can move forward.&#10;&#10;Brewing a potion that is labelled on the modular tile they are currently standing on allows the group to move forward and one step closer to escape. They also have unique abilities such as rearranging recipes, looking at the potion deck to see what is coming up next, and digging up many crystals at once. At the end of each turn the active player can draw up to two crystals from the blind bag to replenish their resources - but each time a black crystal is drawn the guardian moves one space closer to the puppies and the crystal goes back into the bag. If the puppies brew all the potions on the final tile before the guardian lands on their current space - they win! Otherwise, it's game over.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

For example 4 = 4 or 4 + 2 = 6. There can only be one sign on each side of the = sign. Each tied tie will be worth points according to the value of the cards. If he cannot lay a tie, he must draw a card and get rid of a card in hand. The round ends when a player empties his hand. He then obtains a bonus of 50 points. The first player with 1000 points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Rule B :&#10;The game begins the same way as rule A with 8 cards instead of 9 for each player.

The president of the world is then forced to finance mercenary giant robot pilots, paying for each head of the giant monsters.&#10;&#10;Project HUNTER is a minimalist solo print-n-play roll-n-write game in which you drive a giant robot in order to defeat the giant monsters that have invaded the earth. You will need to print these sheets and get some dice, pencils and eraser.&#10;&#10;Objective&#10;The main objective of this game is to defeat at least one monster of each of the six species. However, you must survive until then! Your giant robot is destroyed if its chassis is completely damaged or if it overheats, which will cause an explosion. You also lose if you run out of money after a hunt.&#10;&#10;Hunting Kaijus&#10;To face a monster you first roll three dice. Each die will indicate a monster avaliable. Of these three you will have to choose one to face. If you don't want to face any, you will have to spend $ 50 on the maintenance of your robot to be able to wait another day. So you can roll the three dice again. You start the game with $ 300 in cash (write it down).&#10;&#10;Combat&#10;As soon as you choose a monster to face the combat starts. The combat is separeted between the turn of the monster and the turn of the robot. The monster always starts first.&#10;&#10;Monster Turn&#10;On the Monster turn you must roll a number of dice equal to the Monster Attack value. Each die is treated individually and allocated somewhere in the robot sheet. Each die that landed at number 6 causes 1 Overheat. Each result less than 6 can be absorbed in some armor of the robot. See in the diagram of the robot that there are squares for you to write down the result of the die you want to allocate there. You can place it wherever you want as long as there are already any other results linked to it, it must obey the rule (see below). If you cannot allocate any die in the sheet this die becomes 1 damage in the Chassis.&#10;&#10;Armor&rsquo;s Rules&#10;In the diagram of the robot you will find several blank boxes to record the result of a die. Each of these boxes has an arrow. If the arrow is facing the box, it means that it has some rule. Each symbol on the black circle will indicate he rule.&#10;&#10;Robot Turn&#10;On the Robot's turn you will be able to choose if you want to attack normal with your weapons or if you want to overload the shots. If you choose to attack normal, roll the dice equal to the number of weapons you have (initially you only have one weapon). Add up all the results of all the dice and write down the amount of damage the monster has taken. If the monster loses all hit points, it is defeated (see below).&#10;If you choose to do an overloaded attack, you will roll twice the attack dice but will cause 1 point of Overheating.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
