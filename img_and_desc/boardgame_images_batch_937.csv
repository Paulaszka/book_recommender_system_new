The player with the most bugz at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 9 rounds. Each round, players compete over the bug tokens in the middle of the table. They can be won from either of the 2 types of bugz shown on current bug card.

I hate to draw you away from the much-needed rest you are getting since our last encounter on the campus of Miskatonic University--but this is a matter of life and death.&#10;I have it on good authority that something strange is happening over at The Black Caverns near the edge of town. I can hardly believe it myself, but it seems the same cult we faced previously is finding a new home in the labyrinth beneath Arkham. The information I&rsquo;ve gathered is that they call themselves &ldquo;The Blind Ones&rdquo; and they prefer the dark and subterranean areas of Arkham.  It is a well-known fact among the professors of geology here at the university that there are many varied tunnels and paths in those caves. Most agree that at least seventy-five percent of the underground system has gone unexplored . . . or at the very least undocumented. It would seem that most of those who&rsquo;ve gone down there have never come back up. I hate to say it, but I believe they are being used in some sort of dark ritual. I beg you, go into those caverns, find the missing persons, and stop whatever horrific rituals are being performed.&#10;Sincerely,&#10;Herbert West&#10;&#10;Welcome to One Page Cthulhu. A simple and easy 1920s horror role-playing-game you can play with a single sheet of paper. Perfect for a plane ride, hotel room, or anywhere else.

Benjamin Baker, owner of The Will Street Detective Agency and your boss, is on the guest list because of years spent advising Ms. Clark on the finer details of being a private detective. After the guests arrive and dinner has been served, Rosemary reveals that she has spent the last two years leaving her estate in secret to investigate a very specific crime and that the novel contains hints about both the crime and the one who committed it. Poised to reveal more about the plot and the main players in her mystery, Rosemary has just taken a sip of her nightcap when the lights flicker suddenly and then go out for a period of approximately ten seconds. A scream rips through the night and then the lights come back on. Inexplicably, Rosemary is gone. All that&rsquo;s left where she was standing are a few spatters of blood. After a thorough search of the house, Rosemary is nowhere to be found, and while it&rsquo;s unclear whether any sort of crime has been committed, there is a definite feeling that something is wrong here.
