Will it be you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Unlike most other games, the three VR warriors in the game are shared by the players.  Each turn, the active player throws a die to decide which (red, yellow or green) trooper he controls this time, and then battle a Skug on their way to the penultimate battle, General Ivar.&#10;&#10;Battles are done by tossing dice into a battle arena.  Someone plays the Skug and tosses one die, hoping for a hit (50% chance), and then the active player tosses a die to get a hit as well.  Play continues with 2 more dice on each side , one at a time. The dexterity comes in that you can try to hit your opponent's 'hit' die or your own 'miss' die to switch the result.  Ties go to the active player.&#10;&#10;There is some skill in tossing the dice to change results, but because you cannot control which VR warrior you will assumer on your turn, the game comes down mainly to luck.  Winning battlers earns you a power chip (with a VR glasses wearing dog on it), which will allow you a reroll in the final battle (which is a toss of 4 dice at once, so dexterity plays no role here), while losing a battle loses you the same number of accumulated power chips.&#10;&#10;There's no doubt this is a kid's game for fans of the TV show.

Phil had released versions prior to partnering with Downey Games that were &quot;highlight based&quot; games. The Downey Games release of La Grande Boucle is a departure from previous designs. Rather than continuing the &quot;highlight based&quot; game engine, Phil has developed a full-blown simulation of the Tour de France.&#10;&#10;Phil recently commented, &quot; Although sharing the same name as previous versions, the latest incarnation is a completely different concept. No highlights here as the game system covers the action on the full length of each stage. Every single aspect of Road Racing is covered. There are also options for tactical choices.&quot;&#10;&#10;La Grande Boucle is the ONLY full simulation of the Tour de France. Every stage, time trial, and rider is included in the game.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the Tour de France is quite challenging a subject because of, the huge quantity of riders taking part (around 200) and the difference in the character of the 20 + stages which form the race. However, Phil has risen to the challenge. La Grande Boucle not only gives accurate results, but you'll feel as if you are taking part in the actual Tour de France.&#10;&#10;We do want to reiterate that this is not simply a relabeling of an old game. La Grande Boucle version 4 is a completely new design.&#10;&#10;Phil asked me to close with the following: &quot;The game is meant to be played over several sessions. This is definitely not a fast or quick replay game. The flat stages are fairly quick to replay and will be slotted in one seating. Mountain stages, however, will take much longer to complete.&#10;&#10;Not wishing to discourage you, but finishing this replay will be like finishing the Tour: Difficult but Rewarding. Be warned and enjoy the racing.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game ships with the ratings for the 2004 Tour de France.&#10;&#10;The printed game features individual, die-cut cards for all 189 riders; charts printed in full color, a complete rule book, Team lists in full-color, Replay data in full-color, dice, and a sturdy game box.&#10;&#10;Note: The game is also available in a e-book version (print and play) for a lower price.&#10;&#10;"

Game ends when all cards have been auctioned and clayers with the highest total of good cards wins. Cards are both: money on your hand for bidding and points for scoring in each set sold.&#10;&#10;Goods cards and merchant cards are shuffled together and form the stack of goods to be auctioned. Depending on number of players offer cards from 1 to 6 are used (eg 4 players, cards 2,3,4,5) with the highest card on top. The highest offer card is used to draw that number of goods to make the actual offer on the table. Players start with 4 goods cards in their hand as money for bidding. Players bid in clockwise order increasing their bid at least by 1 - or they pass. Last player with a bid will win the total offer. The bidding cards (= good cards from the players hand) will be placed face up and sorted by kind into the market. Also one of the cards of the offer he won has to be paid as &quot;tax&quot; to the market also- players choice. Than he takes all the other cards of the offer into his hand and he also places the offer card of the actual bid in front of him. He is not allowed to bid again in this round.&#10;&#10;Game goes on with the next highest offer card giving the number of goods making the new offer. So each round each player win different a decreasing number of good cards. When all offers are gone the open market is usually filled with goods.

Often this is a really great grab!&#10;&#10;Following rounds are played the same way until all goods have been auctioned. Players can also sell sets consisting of exactly 3 cards of the same good from their hands whenever they want. That is no real sale but players hold the highest card of each set for scoring.
