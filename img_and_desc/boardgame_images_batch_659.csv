That means Lost Worlds, intrepid Archaeologists, Cliffhangers, and more. The setting may be exotic, the villains particularly villainous, but in truth, it&rsquo;s all about the Story. Whether it&rsquo;s finding treasure, saving someone, or thwarting the villain, it all boils down to the Story.&#10;&#10;Larger Than Life &ndash; Directors Cut can be likened to an action movie where your Hero moves from Scene to Scene trying to succeed in his adventure. What needs to be done? How do you do it? Who&rsquo;s in peril? Who&rsquo;s behind all this? All these things and more are generated for you by the easy to use game mechanics. Inside Larger Than Life &ndash; Director&rsquo;s Cut you&rsquo;ll find:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A variety of characters for you to play with and against. Stars, Co-Stars, Love Interests, Femme Fatales, and of course, the villains &ndash; we call them the Big Bads.&#10;    Over 35 Attributes that you can mix and match to make your characters unique. &#10;    A system that allows your characters to increase in skills and abilities when they succeed, but force them into &ldquo;retirement&rdquo; when they fail.&#10;    An easy to use mechanic that will generate and solve Clues, during each Story, based on your characters abilities. Solve the Clues and you make it to the Final Scene.&#10;    Nine different villains to fight, from Mob Bosses to Cavemen, and everything in between. &#10;    Four different Locales to adventure in. From the back alleys of a large Metropolis, to the villages in a Lost World, your Hero can travel from place to place, all generated by the game mechanics.&#10;    Over fifty Professions to create Victims, Suspects, and People of Interest and enrich your Story.&#10;    Mechanics that generate hundreds of possible adventures, with no two ever being alike.&#10;    Playable solo, cooperatively, or head to head.&#10;&#10;&#10;Cover art is a reused image of the original painting &quot;Blood on My Doorstep&quot; by pulp artist Rafael de Soto.

In &ldquo;Bridges to Nowhere&rdquo;, you are attempting to outwit your opponent and construct the most magnificent bridge. Will you plan for a sturdy long bridge, or maybe take a risk with a shorter multilevel bridge where your points can soar as you reach for great heights? Whatever you do, don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent or you may just hand them the victory.&#10;&#10;Bridges to Nowhere is a 10-minute, 2-player micro game of strategic card drafting and bridge building. In 4 quick rounds, Players take turns drafting &quot;bridge cards&quot; which they will use to attach to larger &quot;pillar cards&quot; creating a unique Bridge tableau in front of them. At the end of 4 rounds, the Player whose bridge scores them the most points wins!&#10;&#10;No one ever said building a bridge was easy though! The challenge and fun of Bridges to Nowhere is found in trying to plan and build within the very particular guidelines of the game. There are three different types of bridge cards (Truss/Cable/Suspension) and they may never be mixed together in the same bridge. Not only that, each bridge card has a numeric point value listed at the bottom along with two symbols, one on each side. Two cards with the same bridge number can never be placed side by side, AND a single line of adjacent bridge cards can only ascend and/or descend numerically once in a single bridge segment.&#10;&#10;The Pillar cards are what you'll need to frame your bridge segments and possibly lay a foundation for a double or even TRIPLE decker bridge(if you've got the nerve). Be careful though, your Pillar cards are a strategic resource. If you don't play them just right you may end up with only a partially finished bridge, and that will cost you!&#10;&#10;Oh, but don't forget those symbols! If you can match two of the same symbols side by side in a bridge segment you'll reap big point bonuses. Another way to gain bonuses in the game is by completing Contract cards. These give both players a very specific set of bridge construction goals to try and reach in order to gain a medium or large point boost to their total score.&#10;&#10;"

Players are dealt an equal number of the 86 cards showing division problems.  Like in war, each player then turns over a card.  They must then solve the division problem displayed on the card.  The player with the highest answer wins and takes all the cards.  If a player's answer is wrong, he or she gives her card to the player to the right.  A wild card automatically gains all the cards in that round for the player who plays it.  Like in wars, equal answers result in a &quot;war&quot; where players play two face-down cards and the an face-up card, and the winner wins all the cards.  Players play a predetermined number of times through the deck or until one player has all the cards.&#10;&#10;"

Each pair consists of related words, e.g., BEE&mdash;H1VE, BIRD&mdash;NEST, etc.&#10;INSTRUCTIONS TO M.C.&#10;PREPARATION FOR PLAY&#10;Tear each sheet along the perforations so that there are 168 slips in all. The first halves are distinguished from the second halves by the spot in the top right c&oacute;rner of the former.&#10;Distribute the second halves about the house or hall with the printed faces upwards and retain the first halves.&#10;List the players by name or number on a score sheet.&#10;Give each player a &ldquo;first half&rdquo; slip.&#10;HOW PLAY PROCEEDS&#10;At the word &quot; GO &rdquo; the players set off to find the counterpart of the slips they hold. A player does not know what the word is, but on seeing the words on the &ldquo;second half&rdquo; slips he will recognise the one he is looking for by its close connection with the word on the slip he is carrying.&#10;When a player beiieves he has found the correct counterpart he presents the two slips to the M.C.; if correct the M.C. records one point for that player and gives him another slip.&#10;If during the game a player presents an incorrect pair of slips to the M.C. he must resume looking for the correct counterpart and is not given another &ldquo;first half&rdquo; slip until he finds it.&#10;OR&#10;If he cannot l&oacute;cate the counterpart and would prefer to have another &ldquo;first half&rdquo; slip, he is entitled to do so but one point is deducted from his score.&#10;THE WINNER is the player who scores the hlghest number of points in an agreed time or when the whole of the slips have been used.&#10;The material in each packet provides for about eight young people.

Now the idea of the game is that the girl is friendly in turn with each of the boys whose names follow and finally marries the young man whose full name is made up of the first letters of the Christian names reading from top to bottom of the list and the wedding date is that at the foot of the list.&#10;&#10;By filling in his recording card as instructed below a player is able to make a list exactly the same as that on the key sheet corresponding to a particular girl's name.&#10;&#10;Suppose we take the name Barbara. Write Barbara in the first space of a recording card; then look for Barbara in the left columns of the Names Lists and on finding it write in the second space the boy's name opposite in the right column, i.e. Roland. Next find Roland in the left column of a Names List and write in the third space the name opposite, For example - lan. Continue in this way until the date June I2th is found opposite Stuart and entered in the last space alongside the word WHEN.&#10;Now enter the first letters of each name recorded in the column headed &quot;FIRST LETTER&quot; and it should then be fairly easy to divide them into two groups giving a Christian name and surname. Write them in the space alongside the word WHO.&#10;&#10;Give each player a recording card and see that he has a pencil.&#10;To begin the game call out one of the girls' names on the Key Sheet and the player who is first to present a correctly completed recording card is the winner.&#10;&#10;An alternative way of playing is to write in the first space of each recording card to be used, before the game starts, the name of a girl and at the word &quot; GO &quot; each player completes his card in respect of the girl whose name appears on it.&#10;&#10;"
