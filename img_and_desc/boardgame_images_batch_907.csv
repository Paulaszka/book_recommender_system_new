The reasons for this growth were the favorable international economic situation and the abundance of labor supply. Exports were also a major stimulus for the development of the country's industrial fabric.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;These years brought extraordinary transformations that affected the lifestyle and customs of Italians, accompanied by a marked increase in living standards. Numerous consumer goods, such as the first washing machines, the first refrigerators and the first television sets, began to enter the homes of Italian families, forever changing the lives of Italians.&#10;&nbsp;&#10;In Dolcissima Vita 2-4 players are entrerpreneurs who produce televisions, washing machines and refrigerators and sell them in Italy.&#10;Most actions in the game are carried out by a very clever dice selection system.

Divinity: Original Sin &ndash; The Board Game is an epic adventure set in the world of Rivellon. Up to 4 players take their heroes on a branching, narrative adventure filled with tactical combat and meaningful choices.&#10;&#10;Based on the award-winning video game Divinity: Original Sin II by Larian Studios, the board game expands Divinity in new directions, offering new characters, stories, side quests, skills, items, and monsters in this brand-new tabletop experience.&#10;&#10;Players embark on a journey through the Divine Atlas, an interactive book that charts the various realms and locations of Rivellon. This team of adventurers will make key decisions about where to go and how to respond to the world around them.&#10;&#10;A full journey through the Divine Atlas takes approximately 20 hours to complete, encompassing around 16 of the Atlas's 50 locations. The decisions players make during exploration, combat, and character creation can significantly influence the story and the course of the adventure. With various ways to finish the game and multiple diverging paths and choices, no two adventures will be the same. Choices you make will be documented from session to session, creating a responsive experience where player decisions matter and their consequences have tangible effects on the story.&#10;Players can choose a character from 10 unique Origin stories, equip items, runes, and learn skills from 12 skill schools, each with 7 unique skills. Players use the skills acquired throughout the game to perform unique and powerful attacks, some with additional elemental effects. Most skills require a cooldown period before they can be used again, so choosing when to use them is critically important.&#10;&#10;The iconic elemental interactions from Divinity: Original Sin are present here! You can, for example, cover an area in oil so that another player can ignite it with a fire spell, setting the entire area ablaze. Alternatively, your ally can cast rain to make the area wet, allowing you to use lightning to stun the enemy. Creating combinations is essential to ensure victory against the most challenging of enemies. However, be aware that enemies can also create combinations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
