The chasm has brought on many new challenges and we hope you can help us solve them. Join us in the underworld to gain the glory you deserve.&#10;&#10;Chain Mail: Adventures of Earthshine is a 1-4 player solo/cooperative adventure game where your goal is to complete a quest before time runs out. A party of four heroes face monsters and terrain that might slow them down, but each deploys unique abilities to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The game takes place in Earthshine, a world that has been literally torn open by a giant meteor. The chasm that has formed has become a new world for exploration, adventure and danger. Our characters have joined up to take on quests below the surface.&#10;&#10;Chain Mail consists of a base set of rules, tokens, and cards, which are then complemented by map, monster, quest, and treasure cards -- one each -- and four hero character cards. The modular design of the game allows for thousands of scenario combinations and a rich depth of party creation and combination.&#10;&#10;Regardless of the setup, each consists of the party working in unison. First they decide to stay or move. Then they roll for trouble, and either battle or adventure. Afterwards, they wrap everything up -- distribute treasure, tend to their wounds -- to end the turn. But the characters REALLY come to life during battle and adventure phases, showing off their special skills and mechanics to create radically different play experiences.&#10;&#10;Every adventure and every party is different; it's up to YOU to guide your intrepid heroes to glory! ...or failure.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Starter Kit was released in January 2019 for Board Game of the Month Club subscribers.&#10;&#10;"

273447,,"Beat The Bookie is the highly entertaining, sociable and strategic board and card game depiction of a day at the races.&#10;&#10;Celebrating a race days three main characters; the Bookie, the Punter and the Horse Owner, players can purchase and sell horses, win prize money and gamble on the Bookie's odds on each of the eight races at the race meet.&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to collect the highest value combination of trophies from the eight races. Trophies are awarded to the player who makes the most profit from each race, either through prizemoney, bet winnings, payouts from players' cards or through horse sales.&#10;&#10;There are three types of trophies on offer. Races 1-3 are known as Maiden Races, and are the least valuable. Trophies awarded for these races are bronze in colour and worth only 1 point each. &#10;Prize money for winning owners in the three maiden races are 1x the Profits (100k for a win, 75k for second place and 50k for third).&#10;&#10;Races 4-6 are known as Handicap races, and are more valuable. Trophies awarded for each of these three races are silver in colour and worth 2 points each. Winning horse owners get 2 x the profits if their horses finish top 3 (200k for a win, 150k for second and 100k for third).&#10;&#10;Finally, races 7 and 8 are known as the Feature Races and are the most valuable, worth three points. Prizemoney is tripled for these two races (300k for a win, 225k for second place and 150k for third). The trophies awarded for these two races are gold in colour.&#10;&#10;Beat The Bookie can be played with 2-8 players. At the beginning of a race meet, a player is nominated to act as the Bookie. The Bookie is a banker of sorts, and is responsible for auctioning the horses, collecting money, calling the horses, laying the horse cards on the track and settling any successful or unsuccessful bets. The Bookie also assigns the trophies are the end of each of the 8 races, but counting up the winnings of each player. The Bookie can also play as a player, but must keep their cash wallet and assets separate from that of the main 'bank'.&#10;&#10;Once a Bookie has been assigned, each player is provided with 300k of Beat The Bookie currency. This is to form each players 'cash wallet'. Player are also given six Bet Slip cards, which depict the names and pictures of each of the horses in the field. These cards are used to place the players' bets.&#10;&#10;The Bookie then conducts the pre-meet auction, and auctions off each of the six horses in the race, with a reserve price of 100k. Players may or may not bid on the horses, with the successful/highest bidder awarded an ownership card for the particular horse bought. The new owner must keep the ownership card until he/she elects to sell the horse to another player or back to the Bookie.&#10;&#10;Once the pre-meet auction has concluded, all players must draw a players card from the left hand panel of the game board. If a player owns a horse, they must draw an Owners Card, which features any fees due or payable to/from the Bookie for their horse. Even if a player owns multiple horses, they need only draw one Owners Card. If a player does not own any horses, they must draw a Punters Card, which offers a special or exotic for the upcoming race. Finally, the Bookie must draw a Bookies Card, which features the odds for the upcoming race. Players can then bet on the odds provided by the Bookies Card, by overturning their Bet Slip Card to reveal the name of the horse they intend to bet on, and placing their chosen bet amount on top of the Bet Slip Card.&#10;&#10;Once all bets are placed and accepted by the Bookie, the Bookie then shuffles the Horse Card deck. There are six cards for each of the six different horses. The Bookie then lays the cards out in order of the Horse, with each horse advancing once space down the game board each time it is drawn. The Bookie draws all the Horse Cards until there is a winner, a second place getter and a third place getter.&#10;&#10;At the conclusion of the race. The Bookie pays out the prize money to the winning owners. If a horse, that finishes first, second or third, is not owned, no prizemoney is awarded in respect of that horse. For races 1-3 (Maiden Races), the Bookie awards 1x the Profits. For races 4-6 (Handicap Races) the Bookie awards 2x the Profits and for races 7 and 8 (Feature Races), the Bookie awards 3 x the Profits.&#10;&#10;The Bookie must then payout any prizemoney owed under Punters Cards. Once done so, or if no prizemoney is awarded, the Punter must place his Punters Card back under the pile.&#10;&#10;Once prizemoney and punters payouts are awarded, the Bookie either pays out or collects on players' bets on the calculation provided for by the Bookies Card. If the Bookies Card showed odds of 4:1, and the player bet 10k, the Bookie must pay the player 40k. Unsuccesful bets are collected by the Bookie and placed back in the 'bank'.&#10;&#10;When all prize money and bet money is awarded, players must count their profits. A trophy (bronze for Maiden Races, silver for Handicap Races and gold for Feature Races) is provided to the player with the most profit from that race. The player keeps the trophy with their cash wallet for counting at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Once trophies are awarded, all players draw their players cards again ahead of the next race.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the players then count the value of their trophies. Bronze trophies are worth 1 point, Silvers are worth 2, and Golds are worth 3. A Player could win the game by not having won any feature races. Conversely, a player might head into race 7 not having won any races for the entire meet, and could win races 7 and 8 and win the game.&#10;&#10;Players can trade their horses with other players at the conclusion of any races for an agreed price. Horses are valuable as they provide an alternative revenue stream. Horses drawn frequently in races may be worth selling, as chance would mean it's unlikely to win again. Players who do not purchase horses at the initial pre-meet auction may wish to purchase horses ahead of the more valuable Feature Races.&#10;&#10;A player is eliminated if they are declared bankrupt and have no more money or horses to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

As the war wears on, both sides will attempt to chip away at the other&rsquo;s prestige and standing. If your prestige falls low enough, your troops and provinces might defect, tipping the balance.

When the big, better known major railroads (PA, B&amp;O, NYC) finally reached the state, they usually just purchased these little pioneers or leased their trackage for 99 years. The State of Ohio wisely offered incentives for the construction of these early railroads. Everyone was happy except for the Canal owners!&#10;&#10;1836 takes place in Ohio, the game lasts about two hours with 3-5 players and the player with the most money wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

His inveterate foe Bl&uuml;cher apparently had learned no lessons and threatened to move again on Paris. By March 3rd Napoleon was returning northward along the bank of the Ourcq River. The fall of Soissons, cheaply surrendered by General Moreau, saw the quarry escape over the Aisne River to link-up with 43,000 reinforcements near Laon, raising his strength to over 100,000. While the Emperor concentrated between Fismes and Berry au Bac, Bl&uuml;cher continued to retreat on Laon. Reaching Craonne, the Emperor decided to advance along the chemin des dames to test Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s position on the plateau, and clear the flank of his advance on Laon.&#10;&#10;The next game of the TLNB-Series covers the Campaign in France, Part II: &#10;6 March to 13 March 1814. &#10;The major battle was Laon, on 9-10 March, when Napoleon, with 37,000, went up against Bl&uuml;cher's position, on the hill of Laon, with 85,000. (Marshal Marmont with a separate VI Corps was supposed to support the attack, but he was dispersed in a night combat.) Bl&uuml;cher wasn't feeling well and failed to pursue. One more battle was to follow (after two days for R&amp;R) and Napoleon won that battle: Reims, against St. Priest. So actually, he won two out of three.&#10;&#10;Battles Simulated&#10; Craonne, Struggle for the plateau des dames, 7 March &#10;The chemin des dames runs the length of a continuous ridge from the N2 to the N44, the two main highways leading north to Laon. Bl&uuml;cher stationed Sacken and Woronzoff&rsquo;s infantry on the plateau just west of Craonne. Napoleon decided on a frontal attack up the chemin on what he believed to be no more than a 20,000-man rearguard. The Russians begrudgingly gave ground, gaining it back in a counterattack, and throwing Ney off the Plateau. Once the French Guard cavalry had stabilized the situation, the Russian right flank began to give way under combined pressure of infantry and cavalry. Napoleon directed 88 guns from the Guard artillery to destroy the Russian center and sent the Guard infantry to attack along the chemin to complete the victory. The Russians withdrew in good order.&#10;&#10;Laon, Beginning of the End, 9-10 March &#10;Marshal Ney advanced on Laon in the morning snow. B&uuml;low with 17,000 men held the suburbs of Semilly and Ardon. On the plain west of Laon, Winzingerode was posted with 25,000 men; east of Laon at Athies, Yorck and Kleist held another 25,000 men; Langeron and Sacken were in reserve with 36,000; Napoleon attacked with fewer than 40,000. As the southern suburbs traded hands, Bl&uuml;cher thought that he was being attacked just by an advanced guard, but Napoleon threw everything into Ney&rsquo;s attack up until 6 PM. Marmont commanded a separate force of 10,000 which had managed to fight their way to Athies by 5 PM, camping for the night. At 7:30, the Prussian Yorck launched a combined arms attack that routed Marmont&rsquo;s entire camp. A small group of French Guardsmen managed to halt the pursuit. Marmont lost 45 guns, all his wagons, and 3,500 men. Bl&uuml;cher lost a chance to destroy his foe&rsquo;s small army.&#10;&#10;Reims, A Quick Success en passant, 13 March &#10;On March 12th the Russian General St. Priest snatched Reims from its small French garrison. Hearing of this, Napoleon and his small force moved east on the 13th, beginning their attack at 4 PM, quickly driving out the enemy, and cutting communications between Bl&uuml;cher and Schwarzenberg at the same time. Only 10,000 French troops were actually engaged against 15,000 of St. Priest. St. Priest was killed along with 3,000 men while losing 23 guns.&#10;&#10;Campaign Game, 6 -13 March&#10;&#10;All three maps fit together to create an irregular playing area 44&quot;x68&quot; and covering an entire week of fighting.&#10;&#10;&bull; Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps &#10;&bull; 560 die-cut units &#10;&bull; 100 playing cards &#10;&bull; Two rulebooks&#10;&bull; 15 player aid cards &#10;&bull; Game Box&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;STANDARD TLNB-GAME SYSTEM:&#10;&#10;&bull; scale: 480m (525 yards)/ hex;&#10;&bull; strength: 500-800 men/SP;&#10;&bull; turn-duration: 1 hour/turn&#10;&#10;"

Some of you are law-abiding agents fighting for justice. Others are crooked operatives corrupting the law. You all meet at the same rendezvous point, but since everyone is undercover, no one is sure who is on their side. To signal to one another, law-abiding agents always speak the truth and corrupted operatives lie. One bullet left to hurt the defector. A medical kit to heal your fellow operative. So, truth or lie, who's on your side?&#10;&#10;What's in the game :&#10;10 Character Cards (5 Law Abiding Operatives and 5 Corrupt Defectors)&#10;20 Power Cards (10 Medical Kits and 10 Bullets)&#10;10 Color Id Cards&#10;100 Questions (50 Cards)&#10;1 Rulebook&#10;1 Marker to indicate turn&#10;&#10;How to play :&#10;In this game of 4 to 10 players, you will take on a role as either a LAW ABIDING OPERATIVE or a CROOKED DEFECTOR. Each role remains hidden and your objective is to help your allies and harm your foes. But how? Depending on your spy code, you will communicate to your team using either lies or truths.&#10;&#10;Once you determine your fellow members, hurt players on the opposing team with the BULLET and heal those on your side with the MEDICAL KIT.&#10;&#10;For each BULLET wound received, your team loses a point. For each MEDICAL KIT you receive, your team will gain one point. Side with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;If there is an EVEN number of players, shuffle together a deck of character cards with half the players on the Law Abiding Operative side and half on the Corrupted Defector side. Randomly distribute one to each player. Players must keep their role card secret during the gameplay.&#10;&#10;Each player also takes a set of tool cards: One BULLET and One MEDICAL KIT. If there is an ODD number of players, select two even sets of ROLE cards (one more card than the number of players). Deal out the ROLE cards and reveal the last one. The team revealed will receive a scoring bonus at the end, to compensate for a fewer player.&#10;&#10;RULES&#10;&#10;There are two rounds in this game.&#10;&#10;Round 1: Gameplay begins with each player getting a choice to MAKE A MOVE or CALL FOR AN INTERROGATION.&#10;&#10;MAKE A MOVE: When a player makes a move, they take one of their Tools, either Bullet or Medical Kit, and gives it to another player. The Tool Card remains facedown. Only the player who received the tool card can look at it. Send Medical Kits to your teammates to score, and fire your BULLET at the other team to reduce their point total.&#10;&#10;CALL FOR AN INTERROGATION:  If you need more information, you may select one of your Tools, either Bullet or Medical Kit, and discard it without revealing to &ldquo;Call For An Interrogation.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Draw the next Interrogation Card and read it aloud. Starting with the next player clockwise, they must make a statement that answers the card. Law Abiding Agents, they must answer honestly. Corrupted Agents, they must tell a lie.&#10;&#10;Feel free to discuss! Because the first player has less information to act on, that player does not have to give up one of their tools to Call For An Interrogation.&#10;&#10;Second Round: After each player has had a turn to either Make A Move or Call For An Interrogation, in reverse order, each person now plays their remaining tool card. There is no more Interrogating in the second round. Gameplay ends with the first player distributing both of their Tool cards at the same time.&#10;&#10;End Game: All the players reveal their Role Cards. All Tools are turned over. Your team gets +1 for each Medical Kit and -1 for each Bullet played on you. Team with the highest score wins. If there is an odd number players, the team with less players gets an additional +1 point. If there is a tie, the team with the most MEDIPACKS wins.&#10;&#10;"

In Dangerous, your goal is to save as many innocent lives from certain doom as possible. To do so, you must outsmart your rival investigators and correctly deduce which apocalyptic predictions are true and which are false. The player who saves the most lives wins.&#10;&#10;In each round, shuffle the twelve prophecy tiles, then lay out three rows of four tiles: the top row (face down) are true prophecies, which players must deduce; the middle row (face up) are false prophecies; and the bottom row (face down) are hoax prophecies. Below each hoax prophecy, lay out a column of four cards face up. The cards come in five prophecy suits, with values 1-3. Among the tiles are two of each prophecy and two 2x.&#10;&#10;The lead investigator for that round places one of their two personal tokens by a hoax prophecy tile, looks at that tile, then chooses a card from that column and places it face up in front of themselves. Each other player then chooses a card from this column. If a hoax prophecy tile has two player tokens next to it, don't refill it; otherwise, do refill it. The next player becomes the lead investigator, and this process continues until each player has chosen eight cards, which they now take in hand.&#10;&#10;Now you evaluate how well you predicted which disasters will take place. The lead investigator reveals one of the true prophecy tiles, then all players simultaneously reveal two cards from their hand. For each card that matches that revealed prophecy, you score positive points equal to the value of the card; otherwise, you lose points. If the prophecy tile instead shows 2x, you score positive points if you lay out two cards of matching value, but different suits; any other combination loses you points.&#10;&#10;Record your scores for the round, and after a total of four rounds (with four players), whoever has scored the most points wins. (With two and three players, you make adjustments to the number of cards and prophecy tiles used and rounds played.&#10;&#10;"

Pollen is the currency that players take to do their actions. Starting with the starting player which rotates each round, each player will take 1 action per turn until a player either passes or runs out of pollen. Once that happens no additional pollen can be awarded through pollen rewards that round. A round ends when all players have passed or run out of pollen.&#10;&#10;Players can move their bees to uncover hive hexes from the field which allows them to decide on receiving a one time pollen reward for that hex or pay its cost to purchase immediately before any other player. They may also move to bee quests which grant end-game victory points, to the waggle dance track which gives players access to their own exclusive field with special abilities, to their hive bank where all pollen and nectar is stored, or to the hive hexes where larva is layed and matured. Field hexes also contain random seasonal challenges which when explored will cause trouble based on the season.&#10;&#10;Other than moving, players may choose to harvest nectar from the field which is used to mature larva based on the color of flowers purchased into the hive, they may lay larva, buy hexes based on the seasonal chart and the location of their bees, and they may mature larva as actions on their turn. As players build their hive they will unlock permanent upgrades to their abilities.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has completed their hive or when the end of the season track is reached.&#10;&#10;Victory points are calculated based on the number of flowers on the hexes purchased into their hive, the number of worker bees they have alive, the pollen in their hive bank, and any completed quests.&#10;&#10;"

In this game you must try to keep your cards &ndash; this is the opposite to some other family games, so be careful! To begin the game, each player is dealt 7 cards and the remainder of the deck is placed in the centre to form the draw pile, then turn over the top card to start the discard pile.&#10; The player to the left of the dealer begins by looking at the card on top of the discard pile. The top card tells you how many cards you must discard through its colour and the number: e.g. if it has the number 1 on it, you must discard 1. Note that the numbers on the cards serve no other function in the game. The colour/colours on the top card determine which colour cards you must discard. Some cards will only have 1 colour, others will have 2.&#10; If you have the required cards place them down on the draw pile to end your turn. Remember &ndash; the card that you place on top will determine the next players go. If you cannot discard the required cards, pick one up from the draw pile (this is good) if you can then put down the cards, place them on the discard pile. If not, declare this to the group by saying &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo;. Your turn is now over. &#10;There are also wild cards which contain all four colours and can be used to complete any set. In addition the pack contains 3 actions cards: Reset cards which end your go and force the next player to put down any card, Invisible cards which mean the next player must play as normal but refer to the card directly underneath the invisible card, and Nominate cards which mean you can nominate another player by name and declare how man cards they must discard: 1, 2 or 3. &#10;This addictive colour-matching contest can be played with 2 or more players and is suitable for 6 years and above.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
