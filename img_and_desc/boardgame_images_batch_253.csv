If a player makes three in a row, he or she can capture one of the opponent's pieces.&#10;     Once all the pieces are placed, players take turns moving the pieces to adjacent nodes. Again, whenever a player forms three in a row, one of the opponent's pieces may be captured.&#10;     When one player is down to just three pieces, the remaining pieces may &quot;fly&quot; to anywhere on the board (not just adjacent nodes).&#10;&#10;&#10;You win when you reduce your opponent to two pieces, or when he or she can't move.&#10;&#10;Two possible boards exist.&#10;One has three concentric squares marked with the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked and also the adjacent corners linked.

The player on offense calls a play from a limited menu (long pass, short pass, end run, line buck, punt, field goal), and the top card is then turned over to determine the result of the play.&#10;&#10;There is a good variety of play outcomes, including fumbles, intercepted passes, and penalties.  However, the game was designed in an era when single wing formations dominated, passing was relatively rare, and offenses were often &quot;three yards and a cloud of dust.&quot;  As a result, long advances from scrimmage are rare.  The longest possible gain is 41 yards on a long pass.&#10;&#10;Defense does not come into play, and the player on defense simply must hope that the player on offense fails to achieve successful play outcomes.&#10;&#10;One pass through the card deck constitutes a quarter of football.&#10;&#10;This game might have nostalgic value for those who played it as youngsters, but there are far better football games available today.&#10;&#10;"
