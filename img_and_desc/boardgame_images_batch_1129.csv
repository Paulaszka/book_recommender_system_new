Recruited from the reserve officer ranks of the Navy, Marines, and Army, one hundred pilots signed contracts to fight. Of those, 99 went to Burma and China. Working together under Claire Lee Chennault, together they gave the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek an &ldquo;instant air force&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Equipped with the fast and well-armored Curtiss P-40B Tomahawk, the pilots of the American Volunteer Group (A.V.G.) held the line against a numerically superior, better-trained cadre of elite Japanese pilots, including a number of aces, who flew aircraft that were far more maneuverable.&#10;&#10;Soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the A.V.G. began its combat operations. It wasn&rsquo;t long before they scored their first success. On 20 December 1941, the pilots of the A.V.G. intercepted a Japanese bombing raid flying to bomb the western Chinese city of Kunming. Of the ten Japanese light bombers that were dispatched that day, the A.V.G. claimed three. A fourth bomber crashed on the way back to its base in occupied French Indochina. On Christmas Day, they flew again, this time downing 24 Japanese bombers and fighters.&#10;&#10;It wasn&rsquo;t long before TIME Magazine covered the story of the Flying Tigers, celebrating their victories against Japan. By April 1942, just five months after the Flying Tigers combat debut, Hollywood was already filming a movie about the outfit, starring John Wayne. Their fight boosted home front morale and inspired thousands to join the US Army&rsquo;s expanding air force. In six and a half months, the Flying Tigers, as the A.V.G. came to be known, downed 297 Japanese aircraft at a loss of just 14 of their own.&#10;&#10;In this game, you take on the role of the Operations Officer in charge of managing the A.V.G., its pilots, aircraft, fuel stocks, spare parts, and airfields. You will face the Japanese as they attack relentlessly, hoping to decimate your forces and bring the Chinese leadership in Chongqing to surrender to Japan&rsquo;s rule. Hanging in the balance are hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers who are engaged in the war in China. If China were to capitulate, the bulk of those soldiers would be available to fight in New Guinea and Australia &ndash; or perhaps continue to advance to the west and attack India.&#10;&#10;In the game, A.V.G. - The Flying Tigers, The future of the War in the Pacific hangs by a thread. Your assets are three squadrons of Curtiss P-40B fighter planes and the pilots of the Flying Tigers in your command. You must apply them well to defend China, take the fight to the Japanese, and achieve victory.&#10;&#10;The game utilizes the roots of the same proven narrative-style system of the top-selling game, MAG-23 Guadalcanal. At the center of gameplay is your War Diary, your aircraft complement, and your pilot roster. A Chinese village-based early warning network will provide reports of incoming Japanese raids. As well, you will fly morning reconnaissance missions to identify targets on the many Japanese airfields, and then return to strafe them later in the day. Your forces will assist the British and Australian squadrons in the defense of Rangoon in Burma as well as fly to protect the Burma Road and the aerial lifeline of C-47 transport planes flying &ldquo;The Hump&rdquo; from India to China to bring in supplies, spare parts, fuel, ammunition, and equipment.&#10;&#10;The Japanese will not be an easy opponent. On almost every mission, you will be outnumbered by their fighters, the Type 97 and Type 98, and face bombing runs from light and medium bombers. The Japanese will strafe your airfields, advance with their ground forces to take Burma and ultimately attempt a crossing into western China at the Salween Gorge.&#10;&#10;A.V.G. &ndash; The Flying Tigers is a fast-playing solitaire air war game that is in the narrative-style. It is highly engaging and fun to play &ndash; and it is easy to learn. Each of the missions can be completed in less than thirty minutes. Utilizing the MAG-23 System, the game is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor a realistic depiction of the air war. It is an entertaining and educational air war game that allows you to experience and learn about the Second World War and its impact on China.&#10;&#10;A.V.G. &ndash; The Flying Tigers is for experienced and novice war gamers alike. Though dice play a role, the outcomes of your missions and the campaign depends on you. The story of your time in China is as you write it. Will your pilots succeed? How many of your men will become aces? How many will be shot down? Will the Japanese defeat China? The outcome of the war in China is in your hands.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The rules are intuitive enough for family gaming (from 10 years and up), but also support clever synergies by experienced players. Suggested difficulty modifiers are also included for those wanting a high level of challenge. While very playable and accessible, success will come from good decisions and teamwork, rather than just through good luck.&#10;There are two ways to play the game:&#10;&#10;1. With a traditional human Overlord, who controls the dungeon, traps and enemies. They can decide whether they want to run a game that is more challenging, or more casual, depending on the player group.&#10;&#10;2. With an Overlord controlled by the game rules, and all the heroes controlled by human players.&#10;Mission setup is very fast due to pre-assembled miniatures and large numbered dungeon tiles. Variety comes from changing the numbered tiles, their side/orientation, door placement and furniture placement. The tiles have a square grid to simplify measuring distances, defining line of sight, and item positioning.&#10;&#10;The game is played in Rounds. In each Round, all the Hero players will each take a Turn with a single Hero, and then the Overlord player will take their Turn.&#10;When a player takes a Turn with a Hero, they may both Move and take an Action (act) with their Hero.&#10;Aside from movement, players can take the below actions:&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&bull; Fight&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Shoot&#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&bull; Cast Spell&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Use a Feat&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Explore &#10;&#226;&#128;&#168;&bull; Revive &#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&bull; Trade&#10;&nbsp;&#10;Some actions are resolved automatically, and others use dice rolls. Combat actions use opposed dice rolls and a dice matching mechanic.&#10;Exploration is a key theme in the game, and the heroes may discover loot (including legendary items), find secret passages or activate deadly traps. Exploration is driven by a shuffled card deck, which creates unpredictability on repeat play-throughs.&#10;&#10;There are post-game sequences for campaigns. Hero players are free to trade items, equipment and even gold between games if they wish as they prepare for their next adventure.&#10;&#10;"

Take those time checks away and, dare I suggest, you have a boring spectacle for live and television spectators?&#10;&#10;But all this is lucky for us when presenting a replay simulation of the sport.&#10;&#10;In sliding events start speed is vital. After 50 metres we get the first time check and that reflects how quickly the sled has been launched down the runway - in the team events that involves strength and running speed and a quick and tidy entry into the sled and settlement into the seats, in individual events 'pushing off' with feet or gloved hands.&#10;&#10;But also the start is all about getting the sled moving as quickly as possible on its journey down the course, for what speed is achieved in that first 50 metres is the momentum that will build up over the run as the weight of sled and crew and the laws of gravity get to work. In 'Sliders' we provide a Start Rating, based on actual start times, which not only sets the first segment of elapsed time for the run but also determines what we call Raw Speed (momentum) which is carried forward to the next Sector. So a good start will bring two advantages, a low Elapsed Time and a good Raw Speed carry forward. Start Ratings range from 0 to 10.&#10;&#10;Driver Skill (the range is 0 to 4) can be used in two ways. From Sector 2 onwards one DS can be used to increase the RS by 3 before the time for that Sector is determined, or used to improve the sled's Stability (ST) by 2. This represents the driver's ability to keep to the best racing line, and to ensure that the sled is 'in shape' and stable. The increase of 3 RS converts to a time saving of 0.03 secs., but again, as RS is carried forward, that is 0.03 secs. for this and each of the remaining Sectors, so gaining that advantage high up on the track is reflected all the way down. Stability is both a driver and team function, with the driver dictating the sled's line and the crew using their weight to keep the sled at the best angle and maintaining the narrow runners in best contact with the track. High up the course stability isn't really a problem, but as speeds build steadily down the run it becomes a vital factor and there is less time to get everything right. Once a sled starts to get 'out of shape', like RS, it is carried forward to the next Sector and as each Sector has a Stability Check it becomes progressively more of a problem, maybe needing the expenditure of a valuable DS to help correct the situation.&#10;&#10;Initially the Stability Rating can be as high as 8, and until that is reduced there is unlikely to be a problem, but with lower Ratings failure of the Stability Check is likely and this will eat further into the ST figure and also reduce RS. 'Braking' (most sleds have some form of crude brakes) is a last resort for RS is automatically reduced by 20 in regaining some (1D6) STABILITY points.&#10;&#10;"

Games are short, and use no custom dice or cards. Other than standard polyhedral dice, everything players need to play with is printable.&#10;&#10;Story: The paths have opened up across space and time. Intelligent beings of all types have been lured through the mystifying black gates that mark the path&rsquo;s root.

Once the gate had been activated it vanishes shortly after, never returning. Those who managed to traverse the path found themselves on a desolate planet, with no way home. The planet grew more crowded and dangerous by the hour as intelligent creatures from every corner of the universe flooded its barren surface.

The eight pawns of each player reside in a &ldquo;trench or dugout&rdquo; alongside the outer edges of the game board.&#10;&#10;A plague has crippled the &ldquo;royals&rdquo; (rooks, knights, bishops, and king) leaving the queens of four different nations to attend to them. The Kitunda, Swahili for chess pawns, are given a crystal (die), which they can use to access the powers of the royals.&#10;&#10;Each roll of a die allows any pawn to enter the field of play using the capability of a royal piece. For example, a 1 on a die allows any chess pawn to move like a rook. While a 6 allows any pawn to move like a bishop, and so on.&#10;&#10;The objective is to capture all opposing pawns until only one victorious player remains.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Rifts are emerging all over space, devouring everything in existence.&#10;&#10;In Chrono Fall: At the End of Space and Time, you are a captain of the SPARCs, special spaceships in the fight against the Chrono Fall. Fly to remotest places of space, advance your technology with your scans, and neutralize dangerous rifts. With the Chrono-Matrix, you can foresee events and modify them, but this will only make the threat worse! Time is running out: Can you complete the Protector together and thus avert the near end?&#10;&#10;You move your SPARCs and the cargo spaceships over a large map of space, a coordinate system divided into hexagonal fields. The rifts you have to neutralise appear on the map unpredictably by dice rolls at the beginning of each turn, but they can also be planned by various spreading mechanisms. &#10;Fly your SPARC near a rift to scan it and advance science. This way you increase your navigation and neutralisation skills, because without technology advancements you don't stand a chance. &#10;Or is it more important at the moment to clear the path blocked by rifts for a cargo ship? The freighters must bring resources from the other planets to Earth, with which the Protector is being built feverishly. That is your main goal! Without a supply of resources, the saving space station will not be completed in time. &#10;Or do you need to use your action points to collect energy crystals in space? These are necessary to provide the energy for all your actions: Flying, scanning, neutralising... You need energy all the time! You can also charge the crystals for more effective actions, but they will be destroyed afterwards. &#10;At the beginning, choose from several SPARCs. You have to consider their individual skills when assigning the many new challenges. &#10;Since you can see the upcoming event cards, you should always consider together whether you want to intervene in the future by swapping cards in order to avert or minimise the damage caused by the upcoming catastrophes. But weigh the risks well, because every intervention in the future causes additional rifts on the game board.&#10;&#10;Chrono Fall: At the End of Space and Time, the new &quot;Kennerspiel&quot; by Ornament Games: cooperative, with unique mechanics and impressive table presence!&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Twelve houses from our town have already burned down!&quot;&#10;&#10;In Evacuation, life on our planet is being burned away thanks to increasingly intense sunlight, so everyone is trying to move all the people and factories in their territories from the &quot;old&quot; planet to a new one &mdash; and they have only four rounds in which to do so.&#10;&#10;You start the game with a full functioning economy, and over the course of play, you must dismantle that economy and move it. Income on the old planet shrinks over time, and production probably won't be much better until you establish yourself on the new planet and kick things into action. Resources can't be mixed across the planets, so you need to take special care with your planning.&#10;&#10;To do this, you choose actions from the player board, with the expert variant adding cards to your hand that allow you to choose additional actions and combine them. Each action has its own value, and the sum of these actions is important for an &quot;end of the round&quot; bonus. Additionally, players move their markers along the orbital track based on the value of their actions.&#10;&#10;If you can raise production of three resources to level 8 and have three stadiums on the new planet, you win. Otherwise, players compare scores after four rounds. Evacuation includes modules to add new play options.&#10;&#10;NOTE: A community FAQ is available here to provide some clarity on Frequently Misplayed Rules.&#10;&#10;"
