In this shadow world of assassins, informers, police agents and anarchists, nobody is quite sure who is who and which side they fight for.&#10;&#10;The game A Study in Emerald draws its central plot from the award-winning short story penned by Neil Gaiman, in which the worlds of Sherlock Holmes and H.P.

The nineteenth century was a time of unrest, with many colorful characters fighting both for and against the authorities. A Study in Emerald is the outcome of the merging of these three worlds.&#10;&#10;This second edition of A Study in Emerald sports new artwork by Ian O'Toole and Tatiana Kuzilova along with a streamlined set of rules that will hopefully help those folks who found the first version a tad complicated. Inconsistencies have been removed and the number of available actions has been reduced to the minimum, whilst still retaining the mood of paranoia from the first edition.&#10;&#10;"

Players take on the roles of fleet admirals in battles ranging from the American War of Independence to the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Each fleet has access to different ships, tactics, and command personalities - each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Offering a unique blend of detail and simplicity, the scenarios included enable the recreation of historic actions or 'what-if' scenarios.&#10;&#10;The rules are designed for 1/1200 scale ship miniatures, although they can be easily adjusted for smaller scales. Game focus is on ships of 6th Rate or above. The game is hex-less, so uses movement and turning templates along with a tape measure or ruler.  Combat and other tests utilize a pool of six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Fighting Sail was designed with a crew-centric approach and has a goal of immersion over simulation. To perform actions players roll a number of dice based on crew and ship capability to test against a target number.  More successes return a better result (more movement, more hits in combat, more damage saves, etc.). The goal of the game is to break the enemy fleet by reducing their morale to zero.  Morale can be lost by taking damage, suffering a collision, or when a ship is taken out of action (by striking, being sunk, or captured in a boarding action).&#10;&#10;The Fighting Sail rules include a points-based system for building fleets and balancing scenarios.  The ship/crew capabilities and special rules for eight fleets are detailed in the book (including privateers and pirates).  Six general engagement scenarios are described to get prospective admirals started on their journey into the adventurous age of fighting sail.&#10;&#10;"

That being said, it is an incredibly strategic battle for 2 players, however as many as 7 can enjoy it, but with 8 or more we wont take responsibility for what might happen next. You and your family &amp; friends will find a new meaning of competitiveness, making Monopoly Night look like a calm night! It's extremely simple to learn for even the youngest gamer, but will take years to master its strategies, making it challenging for the veteran player as well.&#10;&#10;Strategy 101: Every single move counts in the which players try to achieve 5 in-a-row, ball by ball! The fundamental rules take less than a minute to learn, yet the game has the complexity to engage both beginners and experts alike - perfect for the entire family!&#10;&#10;Stack 'Em 5 Rules!&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a color and takes a set of balls. Players take turns stacking balls on the board, the first player starts by placing his/her first ball within the 9 center rods, after which point play is open to any of the 49 rods. Each and every ball is stacked strategically so that 5-in-a-row is accomplished vertically, horizontally, or diagonally just so long as it forms a straight line from point to point with NO turns. Easy Right! The rotation of play is counter-clockwise with a time limit of 30 seconds per turn,  keeping you on your toes. The board itself spins completely around, either left or right on the center rod, giving the current player the ability to look at all the different angles. Only the current player may move the board, and he/she may do so as mush as they like, until the end of their turn. Once a ball is stacked, it cannot be removed or placed elsewhere, and the players turn is over. There are no restrictions on how balls of different colors are stacked. You may put a ball on any of the 49 rods that are open. Once 7 balls occupy a rod, that rod is full, giving the players a total of 343 possible positions on the board. The goal is to simply block your opponent from getting 5-in-a-row while strategically placing your balls to do just that. Be tactical. Obstruct your opponent(s) while expanding your own &ldquo;territory&rdquo;. The game ends when a player has been able to link 5-in-a-row in any way possible.&#10;&#10;"
