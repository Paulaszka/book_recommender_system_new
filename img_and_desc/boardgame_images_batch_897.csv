Unfortunately, the idiom was the prophecy&#10;unclear and therefore difficult to interpret.&#10;The King therefore gave magician Ilidor the order to speak a spell wards of protection to the Village to protect the kingdom from possible dangers.&#10;Dorntal was a small village where everyone knew each other. There was a nice market around the playhouse with delicacies from the entire kingdom. Down by the river lived the fishermen, carpenters, blacksmith and several other artisans. During the day, people in the village went to work and in the evening they met at the inn to dine and play together. The fire crackled in the fireplace of the tavern and the people told each other Candlelight stories, genuine and invented, exciting and funny. And everyone listened. It was a nice feeling to be a part of this village community&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, this inner and outer peace did not last long.&#10;&#10;Due to a failed magic experiment Ilidors in the black tower, this protective magic weakened. The magician Illidor could do nothing more. He turned away from Dorntal and left the black tower at dawn the next day. A note on the wooden door with the words &quot;Portals, Chaos, II-260, Save Yourselves !!!&quot; was the only one what he left behind. What did Ilidor want to say with that? Had Illidor been able to decode the prophecy? Would the protective magic completely collapse in the second age in 260?&#10;Even the dwarfs, elves, and other races now spoke in fear of the imminent end.&#10;&#10;In For the Kingdom, players assume the role of one of the backward houses in the village of Dorntal. By inserting the individual workers, different actions are played out. The mining of raw materials, the procurement of money, the improvement of the workers or the hiring of Heroes are dedicated solely to defending Dorntal and protecting the kingdom. In Farek's Forge, magnificent items can be forged to fight within and outside Dorntal. Face different Quests. Some Quests can be done alone, but others can be done together. The player with the most points wins. However, if the village is damaged / loses morality too much, you lose the game together. But beware: Humans, Orcs, Dragons or Goblins lurk dangerously around Dorntal. The sun sinks on the horizon with increasing speed, so hurry up! It is time: for the people, for the king, FOR THE KINGDOM!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The the first to reach the 'better world' is presented with a challenge selected for them by the other players.  If they succeed, they win the game, if not, they move back the number of spaces shown on the die.&#10;&#10;The challenges include:&#10;Red: Freehand - The player selects a prompt card and must draw a picture of the prompt. If other players can guess what it is, they succeed and advance. The player who correctly guesses moves forward (For example, draw 'Stonewall.)&#10;Orange: You Can Quote Me - Another player selects the first Orange card in the deck and reads it aloud to the player being challenged.  It will be a quote from a public figure or celebrity, and the player must choose which of the two possible answers provided actually said those words. &#10;Yellow: You've Got Talent - the player selects the first yellow card in the deck and must do a charade of the prompt until someone calls out the correct answer before the timer runs out. (For example, do a charade to communicate &quot;Stonewall.&quot;&#10;Green: Just Between Us - The player selects the first green card and shares as much of a personal anecdote as they are comfortable doing.  For example, &quot;Have you ever had a crush on your health care provider.&quot;&#10;Blue: You Think You Know Me - the player selects the first blue card from the deck and reads the prompt question.  Other players must predict how that player will answer.&#10;Pink: Unpinkable - The player selects the first pink card from the deck and reads it aloud, following the instructions to advance or move back.  For example, &quot;You are out with friends and suggest that you all put your phones away.  Move ahead six spaces.&quot;&#10;Purple: Did You Know That? - Another player reads aloud the multiple-choice question, and selecting the correct answer allows the player to advance on their next turn.&#10;The Closet - Players landing in the closet must tell a coming out story before advancing.  They may 'come out' about whatever issue is safe and relevant to them, it does not have to be about sexual orientation. Some may come out about being vegan, agnostic, or straight.&#10;The Rainbow: Rainbow Choice - The player is allowed to select their preferred challenge.&#10;The Better World: In order to win the game, the player who lands here must succeed at the challenge selected by the other players. If they do, they win, if not, they must move back the number shown on their last toss of the die.&#10;&#10;"

This monkey is always hungry &hellip; when he&rsquo;s awake. Fortunately he sleeps most of the time. &#10;The game is played turn by turn. In his turn a player can play 1 action card, or discard 1 action card, and draw a new card (hand = 3 cards).&#10;As an action you can BUILD a beautiful thing into your garden - but only if the monkey is not in front of your hut. Another possible action is to MOVE the sleeping monkey to another players hut. Or, you can WAKE up the monkey, when he&rsquo;s at anothers players hut.&#10;If someone plays a WAKE card, he rolls the HUGO DICE, to see what the monkey will do. The dice has 4 sides with HOT HUNGER, which means, Hugo will eat one of your BEAUTIFUL THINGS. 1 other side shows a sleeping Hugo, which means, Hugo felt immediately back into his dreams, the guy in the hut is lucky, and nothing else happens in this turn. The last side of the dice is I SEE YOU, which means Hugo noticed the active player, while waking him up, and follows him to his hut. &#10;And what about the banana? You can keep these cards in your hand, to give it to Hugo in a HOT HUNGER Situation, so that he can eat it &hellip; instead of your garden d&eacute;cor. &#10;And so players will build d&eacute;cor, push the sleeping Hugo back and forth, collect bananas and hope not the have the monkey in front of their huts, when he awakes hungry. Every eaten thing comes out of the game, so the game ends, if someone has a full garden (5 beautiful things), or if no beautiful things are in stock (in the middle). In this case, the player with the most beautiful things wins. In case of a tie, the winner will be the one who&rsquo;s furthest away from Hugo.&#10;&#10;"

After suffering a humiliating loss at the hands of the Allied nations, the former Great Power is now confronted not only with the death of millions of its citizens, but also with a severe economic crisis and a political turmoil that threatens to plunge the entire nation into civil war. The November Revolution of 1918 ushered in a new era of liberal democracy in a country traditionally ruled by noblemen warriors. The first democratic election has now been held, but democracy&rsquo;s enemies are numerous, and the future of the fledgling Republic appears grim. No one can tell whether the democratic Coalition will prevail or whether any of the extremist factions will rise out of the chaos and seize power.&#10; One thing is perfectly clear, however: the coming years will not be remembered for their peace and stability.&#10; The Weimar Republic is a Card Driven Game of political struggle in interwar Germany. Four factions compete for dominance: the democratic Coalition, the Soviet-backed Communist Party, Hitler&rsquo;s National Socialists, and the far-right Radical Conservatives.&#10;&#10;The game follows a timeline of 15 years (1919-1933) with two rounds in each year. During a round, players take turns using their faction-specific abilities to increase their influence in Germany&rsquo;s regions and major cities, to maneuver the political landscape of the Republic, and to dominate through a combination of propaganda, parliamentary elections, street violence, economic influence, and ideological zeal. Typical actions include agitation, reforms, recruitment and deployment of fighting men, strikes, uprisings, assassinations, and coups. General and regional elections are held at irregular intervals throughout the game, potentially shifting local power balances in sometimes radical ways. The timeline moves through three distinct eras, each with its own deck of event cards. There are also several special cards like Elections and Parliamentary Control Cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is fast-paced; initiative flows back and forth, and the direction of the game may change rapidly and unexpectedly. Although competition between the factions is fierce, some of the faction-specific mechanics overlap, and players can often take advantage of each other--including the making and unmaking of alliances.&#10; The Weimar Republic includes scenarios ranging in length from 3 to 8 hours and a special tutorial scenario that can be played by new players in only 90 minutes. Victory is absolute and generally achieved through &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo;; there is no final scoring or adding up of different objectives. Each faction can be replaced by a &quot;bot&quot; player, allowing 1-4 players to play with any combination of factions.&#10;&#10;"

In The Grand Carnival, players compete to create the most impressive carnival this town has ever seen. You'll need to carefully plan your carnival's layout, build attractions, hire staff, and manage the crowds, all while learning a few tricks of the trade.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players cover a number on their player board, then select an action. The covered number determines the effectiveness of their action &mdash; and won't become available again until the next round &mdash; so players need to think carefully about which number to use. Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;&bull; Place a Foundation Tile: Select a foundation tile to place on your fairground. The higher the number you cover, the more tile options you have. Each tile is a 2x2 grid and is made up of construction sites and walkways. Attractions can be placed only on construction sites, whereas guests can move only on walkways, so place your tiles carefully.&#10;&#10;&bull; Build an Attraction: Select a polyomino attraction and place it on the construction sites on your fairground. The size of the attraction you can select depends on the number you cover. Larger attractions can collect more tickets (and can be worth more points), but can be difficult for guests to move around.&#10;&#10;&bull; Move a Guest: Select a guest token and move it along the walkways on your fairground. The distance a guest can move depends on the number you cover. If a guest moves next to an attraction, place a ticket token on that attraction. If you move enough guests, you can hire a carnival barker; barkers help guests move quickly through your carnival, but take up precious space in your fairground.&#10;&#10;After taking your action, see whether you qualify for any of the three &quot;Tricks of the Trade&quot; cards. Each trick has a requirement that must be met before you unlock its unique ability. Once a player unlocks a trick, each of their opponents has one turn to meet the same requirement or lose access to that trick for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;After seven rounds, the game ends. Players earn points from sets of the same size attractions, sets of each size of attraction, carnival barkers, guests that move all the way through your park, and their tickets.
