It is a simple spin-and-move game with 'Switches' that can alter your direction of movement. When reaching a switch, the player stops and rolls again to see which track line to use to move further. It is a simple even-odd 50-50 determination.&#10;&#10;The goal is to build a train, starting with an engine, then two rail cars and end with a caboose. The first player to do this wins. Building is accomplished by drawing the correct card (cardboard pieces) at random when the player lands on a &quot;Draw Card&quot; space. The &quot;cards&quot; are upside down. A locomotive engine must be drawn first, then the rail cars. The caboose is last, just like in the old kids&rsquo; story The Little Red Caboose. If the &lsquo;card&rsquo; drawn is not the correct one, it is returned to the draw pile.&#10;&#10;This second edition is very different than the original edition of The Fun Game of Switch in design and components. The original edition was a &ldquo;spin and move&rdquo; race game with a small network of tracks and switches. Just about everything is different other than the name, box cover and the use of a (thin) train switching theme.&#10;&#10;While it appears the original edition game publication is from the 50&rsquo;s (based on web info and artwork) this second edition appears to date from the latter 70&rsquo;s and into the 80&rsquo;s. The original publisher initially produced this game under the  Warren Built Rite Games brand but stopped after a few years. Starting around 1981 the Tee Pee Toys, Jessup Paper Box Co. produced this game and a few others under license with a few small changes to the box and inclusion of punch out player tokens on the game board rather than pawns.&#10;&#10;"

The premise is simple and gameplay is speedy.

Though relatively unknown, these conflicts, raging from 1739-1748, comprised the first &quot;world war&quot;. The primary naval actions took place in three theatres: the English Channel and Bay of Biscay, the Caribbean, and the western Mediterranean. Forces also clashed in India, along America's eastern seaboard, and in the Pacific. Cold Waves examines the European Atlantic coasts, the Channel, and the North Sea, where tedious blockade duty and convoy hunting was laced with the ever present fear of amphibious invasion &ndash; something both sides tried more than once.&#10;&#10;Cold Waves is a two player strategy game. You command either the British or Bourbon (French and Spanish) fleets. Orders are handed down to you from your Admiralty, and you must try to fulfill them within the framework of the wider war, which is represented by a set of events. Your opponent will have orders of his own to fulfill, but with his spare forces he will be attempting to foil your plans. Success will earn you Prestige (victory points). You must decide when and where to commit resources, where to feint and where to strike, organising your 'sail' (ships) into squadrons, and your squadrons into flotillas commanded by leaders (commodores and admirals). Maintaining sufficient forces at battle readiness is critical, but very difficult, since ships constantly suffer wear and tear &ndash; a battle may be won and the campaign lost. Scenarios are one year (16 turns) long, playable in 3-4 hours (the number of counters actually in play on the map is quite small). The campaign game consists of a number of years pre-chosen by the players.&#10;&#10;Every ship that appeared in the theatre is accounted for, as is every leader of note. (Although by the basic rules ships are generic 'SPs', players can use the OOBs to add detail and even fight battles using their favourite tactical system.) Squadrons are rated for movement and the number of sail they can contain. Specially named squadrons represent the great ships, like the 112-gun Real Felipe, which successfully beat off a simultaneous attack by three British ships of the line. Other counters represent special assets, like fireships, frigates, and galleys. These can be 'played' (like cards) to conduct special tasks such as search and shore bombardment. Leaders are ranked, and rated for skill and personality.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You and your opponent have the same decks, though, and they can fight back just as hard as you, so always think two steps ahead in order to claim the most cards and (most importantly) your opponent's multiplier spirits. Spirits are divided into two distinct clans: red/black and yellow/white, and you can play Tatsu in teams or one-on-one.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player reaches 500 points, at which time the player/team with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Tap trees, boil sap into syrup and develop your tiny acreage into the finest maple farm in the province.   Bound by the code of neighbourly conduct, the actions you take will also help your opponent but at the end of the season, there can only be one Master of Maple Syrup.&#10;&#10;In Masters of Maple Syrup, players develop their property tableaus by adding trees to harvest sap from and utilities to improve their syrup production. On their turn, the active player determines the action both players will take, with a slight advantage in their favour.&#10;&#10;The game ends at the end of a round where any player has placed 10 cards on their property (tableau). Scores are tallied from the value of cards on each players&rsquo; properties and any additional scoring bonuses the cards offer. The player with the highest value on their property wins.&#10;&#10;Time your actions and develop a property to best benefit from your neighbour's actions in a cozy cabin game for two.&#10;&#10;"
