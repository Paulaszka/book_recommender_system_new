During the last 16 years the group has successfully fought over 38 battles, which have included Wagram, Salamanca, Borodino, Leipzig and Waterloo, using its own, home-grown set of specially designed rules.&#10;&#10;Art of Command evolved from the group&rsquo;s desire to refight big, multiplayer battles. The set aim was to simulate the confusion and impact the chain of command has on such major engagements through the interaction of players representing the various commanders from brigade through divisions and corps to army level. The objective is to replicate the historical ebb and flow of battle at battalion, squadron and battery level, refight them over an accurately contoured, scaled model and complete them in a day.&#10;&#10;The group initially tested existing, commercial rule sets but felt that these were designed for small table engagements lasting a couple of hours or larger games with brigades being the smallest units represented. It was concluded that we needed rules that would encompass command, communications and control functions.  Rules that would enable us to coordinate and accommodate a large group of commanders refighting battles the size of Waterloo, but still represent battalions and squadrons on the wargame table.  We believe Art of Command fulfills this need and the fact that the group successfully completed almost all the battles in a day is a testament to the robust nature of the rules and the thorough testing which has taken place.&#10;&#10;We recommend Art of Command to those wargamers who wish to simulate a major Napoleonic, multiplayer battle in a day.

This game showcases a unique landing system.  While the fight to capture the island is not really 'in doubt', the Marines have a difficult time of wresting control of the place from the tough Japanese defenders.  The main battle campaign starts with the Marines aboard their transports.  From there they must move onto the landing craft and make their approaches to the beach.  The fire from the Japanese ashore is heavy and, as the Marines dicovered to their dismay, the reef causes a major disruption in the landing plan.  It also creates plenty of easy targets for the Japanese player to hammer.  Once ashore the Marines are going to be hammering away with everything they have and the dugin enemy positions are hard to eliminate.  Securing the island within 4 days is no picnic and playing it safe will not cut it.  The Marines need to be aggressive and willing to take casualties in order to move forward.&#10;&#10;In the Landing system all Marines start on their transports.  When they become available on the Wave Chart they are loaded onto their landing craft.  From there they move to the Landing Craft Beach Chart.  From here the Landing Craft determine which hexrow of the beach lane they will enter the map.  This can cause some serious traffic jams.  Then the landing craft make their run ins' to the beach.  This is pretty exciting in itself, but then the Marines find wire and mine obstacles waiting for them in front of the sandy beach.  These cause major problems in landing.  The net result of all this is some very high nervousness about whether the Marines will get a solid bridgehead ashore.  The most problematic beach is RED 1.  The Marines here almost didn't make it and it is where the 'the Issue is in Doubt' quote comes from.  You will do better I'm sure.&#10;&#10;There are some small scenarios, focusing on 1 beach, an intro scenario of the 2/8 Marines attacking on 22 Nov, and a 'what if' scenario should the Marine player decide to try his hand landing on the 'Black' beaches.
