A Shaman begins their duty as just a youth, but must be wise beyond his or her years in order to grow, expand and thrive as a tribe. As the spiritual leader you will decide when and where your tribe should hunt, gather, settle, build and more. The best Shamans commune freely with the spirits, animals and nature itself, but this path is not always peaceful, beasts will be slain and foes will be vanquished. Will your tribe grow and thrive or merely survive?&#10;&#10;You are the Shaman leader of your specific tribe. Each Shaman has a collection of skulls in which they may commune with the spirit world. You must use these skulls to take actions, or harness a beast spirit, or even create and collect totems for bounties at your life's end. The actions you choose will tell your tribe to move, engage, grow, or worship, each having its own set of choices. In doing so, you will collect resources from the land to feed your tribe, to develop technologies, to build resources, make offerings to the great spirits, activate skulls and more. As the Shaman you must be wary of impending catastrophes known only to you and the other Shaman of the world. The Shaman whose tribe has the largest population is winner.&#10;&#10;A tribe's total end game population consists of their total token dial amounts (rovers, warriors, villages), their totem bonus amounts, and any end game bonus population. The population represented by the dials underneath your tokens on the board will be the main portion of your score.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

The player calculates the answer and then plays the card from their hand. If they are right, they keep the card, otherwise the card is discarded. The player with the most cards when the deck of problem cards is depleted is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Kappa is small humanoid that lives in rivers and waterways. The top of its head is formed like a crown or a dish, and the Kappa must keep water in it to stay healthy. If the Kappa spills or dries out, it suffers and dies.&#10;&#10;In this game, the Kappa is an inverted paper cut with the base cut into the crown. Players take turns to add water to the crown using straws. A player dips the straw into a glass of water, puts their finger on the open end, and draws the straw out. Then they put the straw to the crown and release the water. The next player does the same and so forth.&#10;&#10;Gradually the crown fills, until only surface tension is holding the water in. Eventually, a player adds enough water to break the surface and the water spills, and that player loses.&#10;&#10;The crown design means that it takes a surprising amount of water to break. Players start taking up less and less water, and the other players mock their lack of nerve.&#10;&#10;The game was originally hand-made and as well as a full sized Kappa, the game also has a mini Kappa for a quicker result. The game can be played by young children and adults alike.&#10;&#10;In 2019, a professional version was made by itten, Kappa Bros!.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Alternatively players may also draw blueprints from the blueprints decks or park cards from the park deck or market, or gain money (1 per attraction they have built).&#10;&#10;After all players have taken 3 actions each (or 4 if they have built their Showcase attraction), players progress to the Guests step where they earn income from the stars (representing guest appeal) on the cards they have built in their parks, and perhaps from staff members.&#10;&#10;In the Cleanup step players discard down to 5 cards in hand and reset the market, ready for the next round.&#10;&#10;Over each game of 6 rounds and 20 or so actions players build a mix of attractions, upgrades and staff into their park tableau to generate increasingly larger incomes each round.

Its Filipino name is Salpakan. It is designed for two players, each controlling an army, and a neutral arbiter (sometimes called a referee or an adjutant) to decide the results of &quot;challenges&quot; between opposing playing pieces that like playing cards have their identities hidden from the opponent.&#10;&#10;The game simulates armies at war trying to overpower, misinform, outflank, outmaneuver, and destroy each other. It optimizes the use of logic, memory, and spatial skills. It simulates the &quot;fog of war&quot; because the identities of the opposing pieces are hidden from each player and can only be guessed at by their location, movements, or from the results of challenges. The game allows only one side's plan to succeed, although a player may change plans during the course of the game. In addition, there are two different ways of winning the game. Certain strategies and tactics, however, allow both sides the chance of securing a better idea of the other's plan as the game progresses. Players can also speak or gesture to their opponents during matches, hoping to create a false impression about the identity of their pieces or their overall strategy.&#10;&#10;--Information collected in July 2020 from Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Generals&#10;&#10;"

In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.

Some cards keep your opponent's creatures down, making it difficult for them to muster a fighting force or reap enough &aelig;mber. Once your enemies are exhausted, you can keep them out of commission with other cards or even wipe away their board.&#10;&#10;Each Dark Tidings deck also includes a high/low tide card.

This deck is an exact copy of &quot;Speaker Domitia&quot;, a real deck that has been printed and can be found by another player out in the world. The crucial difference is that in an evil twin deck, many of your creatures look a little different. Specifically, in Dark Tidings, many creatures have evil twin variants, and if you find an evil twin deck, every creature with an evil twin variant appears in that form. These evil twin creatures feature new artwork, graphic design, and abilities, making them a significant departure from the original creature.&#10;&#10;"
