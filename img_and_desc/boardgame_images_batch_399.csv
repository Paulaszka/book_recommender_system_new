During play, individual British soldiers will brave German fire (the game system) while moving across No Man's Land towards the enemy.&#10;&#10;The game uses a deck of cards, dice and provides pieces which are moved across a standard checkerboard.&#10;&#10;Four scenarios are provided.&#10;&#10;"

It's not always that easy, however, as the Gamer letter is not in their control.  Players need to be creative - some examples (with Gamer letter in parantheses):  (M) Martha Washington, (U) Washington University, (D) Denzel Washington, (R) Washington Redskins, (P) Washington Post, (O) Olympia Washington.  Matches can be ANY two-word proper name (person, place or thing) agreed to by the group (including songs, movies, friends, etc.). Strategy is imperative, with turns being extended by matching Namer-Gamer colors.  Players may need to draw additional cards or trade cards with other teams.
