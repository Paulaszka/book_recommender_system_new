You take risks and develop strategies.  You will experience 'the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.'  But win or lose, you will know that you have been in a game!&quot;&#10;&#10;This is a fairly typical &quot;special interest&quot; roll-and-move game with a psychoanalytical theme and a couple unique twists.&#10;&#10;As players move around the outer track, they collect ID, EGO, and WOW!/OW! (Superego) cards through square instructions and a Chance card mechanism.  You use these cards throughout the game to buy BUTTONS and ZAPPERS, and to avoid penalties.&#10;&#10;Linked at the corners of the outer track are four independent alternate routes, one each for the themes IS/EGO/SE and GONE BANANAS.  While on these alternate paths you have the chance to earn a BUTTON (literally) of the corresponding color...but each path also entails risk and expense.&#10;&#10;Some of the squares along the outer track where &quot;Chance&quot; cards are had can be &quot;owned&quot; by players by buying ZAPPERS with ID cards.  Once bought, the squares are marked with one of the player's ZAPPER tokens.  That player gets benefits for landing on the ZAPPER, while his opponents landing there have to give him a BUTTON or WOW! cards, and the opponent gets all his OW!s.  Each ZAPPER location can be bought and re-bought (at a higher price) throughout the game.&#10;&#10;The game ends immediately when one player has buttons of all four colors (representing a balanced personality) and more WOW!s than OW!s (representing positive self-worth...I guess).&#10;&#10;The production value is first-class, as is the professional artwork on the nicely-mounted board.  The bits are plastic and specially designed for the game - the player tokens are bananas on a little colored base.  The cards are the only weak spot, small print on heavily-colored, cheapish  card stock.&#10;&#10;The double goal and constant shift of buttons might make this game a cut above the standard RaM fare.  Keeping resource cards and buttons hidden would also increase the fun...and the chaos.  I've had many of these low-volume specialty games pass through my thrifting hands, and this may be the first I actually try.  The Freudian theme might wear thin early, but who knows, I might learn something about myself...or my mother.&#10;&#10;"

One player controls an invading orc army and the other player controls the human and elf defenders trying to stop them. Included are two pages of rules, a small color map and a sheet of one-sided unmounted counters.&#10;&#10;Besides the standard two-player version there are also rules included for playing with three or four players.&#10;&#10;"

You either add a coin to the number on the board that is the sum of the dice or add two coins to the respective numbers. (e.g., if you roll a 2 and a 3, you could place a coin on the two and a coin on the three, or place a coin on the five)&#10;You may also use one of the numbers to remove one from your opponent's board and place it on your own. (e.g, take from your opponent's 3 and put it on your two). &#10;There are no sixes, sixes do nothing. In fact, rolling double sixes requires you to remove one of your own coins. Otherwise, rolling doubles allows you to go again.&#10;The first to cover all his/her numbers wins.&#10;&#10;"

Depending on the type of city a player&rsquo;s pawn lands a player may raise funds, spend funds to get vote chips, declare vote chips for a state in the hopes of getting a plurality to earn that state&rsquo;s electoral votes or go head-to-head with another opponent in a debate. Lines connect the cities to regulate the movement of the players&rsquo; pawns.&#10;&#10;The players divide $72 million dollars and each chooses a different city to start the game. To move, a player rolls the die and advances that many cities unless the roll in a one and that allows a free move to anywhere on the gameboard. The city landed upon regulates what a player&rsquo;s actions are on that turn. After taking one&rsquo;s turn the player advances the calendar pawn one day. The game is over after seventy-two days. The players add up their votes and each state&rsquo;s electoral votes are awarded to the player who has the most votes. Ties go to whomever rolls the higher number. States where no one has any votes goes to the player who has declared the most popular votes in that region. The player who has the most electoral votes is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each player controls a team of 4 cyclists. The game is not dice controlled and not with cards either. In fact it has quite a tactical system, the rules are quite simple but don't depend on luck. Per turn each cyclist can use either 3,4,5 or 6 action points to move the same number of squares (each number can be used only once). There can't be more than one rider on a square (except the blue ones), so riders can eventually be blocked. The red marks are intermediate sprints, where 4 points are awarded to the winner. The blue squares are punctures. There are also bonus points for a cyclists who helps another cyclist (for example after a puncture), this bonus is added because of 'comradely behavior' (the communist regime clearly showing here). At the end of the race every cyclist gets points (80 for the winner, 76 for the second,...). Now the players add up the finishing-points and bonus points of their 4 cyclist to determine who wins the game. The board (58*32cms.) looks surprisingly beautiful and well designed for an East-German game, the cyclist are also well produced, in plastic. Nice vintage game for collectors of sports games.&#10;&#10;"
