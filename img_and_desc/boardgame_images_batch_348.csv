Everyone discusses the wine and then teams take turns choosing cards that match what they feel will best match the pouring teams decisions. Unlike many wine games, this is not a trivia game where you are asked questions; You only need to place your marker on the game board to indicate the following questions: Where is it from? What's the grape? How old is it? How high is the alcohol? Naturally, you have to guess. Whoever guesses best gets the most points for the bottle, and you play as many bottles as there are teams.&#10;&#10;This game is a blast and wines is always great!&#10;&#10;"

Cheater&rsquo;s alliance points are easy to accumulate, and accumulate faster when you have many players in your alliance. However, any member of an alliance can turn the other members of the alliance in and take the alliance's points, adding them to their honest score. So the question is, &ldquo;How far you trust a group of self-admitted cheaters?&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Cheater&rsquo;s Game uses about five standard six-sided dice, two point trackers, a turn tracker, player score pawns, and several sets of cheater&rsquo;s alliance pawns.

A player's turn essentially consists of two parts: A move in which one of the player's meeples moves either on a path or through the jungle, cutting down all or some (or none) of the rattan on the way; this costs rattan itself. Afterwards, the player rolls four dice to plant four new rattan plants anywhere on the board, but only in places adjacent to as much rattan as one die shows. Whoever  reaches the sum of 18 rattan pieces first, wins.&#10;&#10;"

The 1810 wedding celebration of Crown Prince Ludwig I and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen swiftly became an annual tradition known as Oktoberfest. Each year the scope of the festival expanded, and by the late 1800s sponsored beer halls and competing breweries were in full operation.&#10;&#10;Oktoberfest is a card-driven game loosely based on the folk festival which began as a public celebration of a royal wedding. Based during the festival in the late 1800s, players vie for control of each of six types of beer, even though many of those beer styles are barely available in Bavaria and completely unrelated to Oktoberfest. As patrons arrive at the festival, players bid to decide where they go and how much they drink. By placing cards in the various tents, players can purchase barrels of beer based on the type and number of patrons on the card. The player who gets rid of the most barrels of each gains points for that type of beer at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The problem? The game ends before all twelve tents can be completed, and only closed tents count for points. Whichever beer type is the last in the tent before it closes claims all points for that tent, and the players with the most barrels of each type acquire points.&#10;&#10;But watch out for the evacuation card that comes out randomly and wipes out entire tents. Collect the right types of barrels, close tents with the corresponding beer cards on top, and victory could be yours!&#10;&#10;"
