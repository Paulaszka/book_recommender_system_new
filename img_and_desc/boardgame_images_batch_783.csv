Each player takes on the role of a Dinosaur (the deck has three carnivores and three herbivores). Your goal as the Dinosaur is to get as many Victory Points as possible by Biting, Clawing, Stomping, and Smashing the pesky, trophy-seeking Victorian Hunters as they sip their tea and eat their lunch.&#10;&#10;A game takes about 15-20 minutes to play. Each player is dealt three Hunters that they are racing against their opponents to complete. You complete a Hunter by matching (in order) all of the symbols on the Hunter&rsquo;s card with your Attack cards, while trying to use the best Victory Point card on each Hunter.&#10;&#10;Each Hunter is also looking to catch a specific Dinosaur (that upper left hand corner image of the Dinosaur on Sergei&rsquo;s card). If a player completes a Hunter that was looking to catch them, they earn double points.&#10;&#10;But watch out! There are special cards that allow your opponent to steal your Attack Cards or even swap your Hunter with theirs (getting all the associated Victory Points as well)!&#10;&#10;Team Play and Simple Play (for young kids) As there are three Carnivores and three Herbivores in the deck, players can split into two teams and compete together, rather than playing a free-for-all. Also, if you ignore the VP and specials, you can use the game as a simple color/symbol matching game with younger children&ndash;work them up to Victory Points after they learn math skills and finally teach them the Special Rules when they have mastered Victory Points.&#10;&#10;"

Alchemists have settled on the misty shores. Alchemists have the ability to transmute the gold, silver and copper into magic pearls. The kingdoms send out messengers to get magic pearls made by the alchemists and to bring them back to the kingdom. All the messengers wear rings made from the noble metals. They&rsquo;re on the move day and night, exchanging the rings among themselves as alchemists require two different metals in order to make a magic pearl.

A kingdom possessing magic pearls, possesses the highest wisdom and magical power.&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;The game is played on a board with hexagonal blocks of different heights, that form a different board every time. Each player has to pawns with rings (metals), that come in each players color. He moves his pieces using cards covering the height difference between the blocks. Exchanging rings between players when playing pieces meet, enable a player to collect pearls along the side of the board.

With the resulting cash, you then &quot;buy&quot; more Senators, controlling yet more votes in the Senate.

Players earn money by purchasing resources at auction, extorting them from other players, then selling them in sets to the bank.

The game lasts a variable number of turns, and when the fourth war is revealed it immediately ends.

The game is simple, relatively short, and highly interactive. The key decisions are both tactical &mdash; how to value the cards at auction and how to bid for the wars, deficits, and other events given your relative position &mdash; and strategic: choosing which Senators to collect and how long to build sets versus when to cash in and buy Senators.&#10;&#10;Everyone is transacting all the time, and the game integrates different bidding systems including an open step bid (like many worker placement games) at the market auctions, blind bidding at the wars, an innovative high/low blind bid at the budget deficits, dutch auctions when new Senators arrive, and shotgun offers (similar to Kuhhandel or Medici v Strozzi) when players extort from each other.&#10;&#10;"

System collectible card game, but is a completely rebuilt game that takes some inspiration from the original. Combat has been streamlined, the turn structure is different, the resource system has been revamped, and the game is no longer collectible, with cards instead being released in a non-random format. A single box contains a full play-set of all cards.&#10;&#10;Vs System 2PCG: SHIELD vs Hydra pits these two organizations against each other with 200 new cards including Main Characters, Supporting Characters, Plot Twists, and Locations.
