You have three nations to choose from &ndash; the conservative British, the offense-inclined French, and the extremely effective Germans. Each nation has a different battalion structure, and thus a different set of tokens representing units and nation cards that you play in the game. Your task will be to get as many victory points as possible, which you receive from carrying out orders. This, in turn, determines which fields in the enemy&rsquo;s system of trenches must be occupied only temporarily, or kept completely. The battle takes place on a board representing both players&rsquo; network of fortifications, separated by a narrow strip of No Man&rsquo;s Land.&#10;&#10;Piek&#197;&#130;o Okop&oacute;w lets you feel the excitement of giving commands in order to get a few meters of land that are bought with the blood of thousands of soldiers.

It is suitable for 2-10 players and can be learned by children as young as 5 years old.

Count the Villagers and return to your lair or continue your turn, at your choice.&#10;&#10;Play continues until some dragon/player has eaten 15 or more Villagers and is satiated.

Hundreds of thousands suffered and died, as war raged for four years - from the trenches of Flanders to the steppes of Ukraine, from the mountains of the Alps to the deserts of Syria, from the depths of the ocean to the heights of the sky. No one had a clear understanding of how the war could be won. And in the end, it wasn't. It was only stopped for twenty years.&#10;&#10;The Unwinnable War is a block wargame for 2 to 4 players. One or two players may play either side, the Central Powers and the Entente.&#10;&#10;The game is PnP, i.e. all materials are freely downloadable.

No longer willing to stand up to NATO in set-piece battles which they know they will lose, the Taliban insurgents disguise themselves among the population, use Improvised Explosive Devices, and draw upon large numbers of expendable recruits arriving from Pakistan and elsewhere. Can the Taliban defeat the enormous technological edge held by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) and their NATO Allies? Or can the GoA convince the wavering population to have faith in the new government, and set the conditions in Panjwayi for stability to take hold for the first time in a generation?&#10;&#10;Choose either side, and use your unique strengths against your opponent's weaknesses to determine who will win control of the symbolic home of the Taliban.&#10;&#10;Designed by a soldier who fought there, Panjwayi is easy to learn, quick to play, and hard to master.

Thirty-six scenarios track the operations and battles that took place or could have taken place between the fleets and air forces of Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Soviet Union, Finland and Sweden. In addition to their complete Baltic Sea orders of battle, the Soviets, Swedes and Finns all have additional ships they planned or began to construct but did not complete. And of course the game includes scenarios for their use.&#10;&#10;There are 140 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 420 standard-sized square ones representing smaller warships, transports, aircraft (many, many aircraft) and a handful of markers. This is a big game, at least in terms of pieces. The map is not so big: the Baltic Sea is pretty small and almost completely land-locked, with ports and airfields in abundance. Aircraft are very potent in this theater, and ships have very little room to hide. The map by Guy Riessen shows the full Baltic on a single 11x17-inch panel.&#10;&#10;The scenarios cover all of the action from the Polish &ldquo;Operation Peking&rdquo; in which three destroyers escaped to England just before the war began, to the planned Swedish invasion of German-held Denmark in May 1945.&#10;&#10;"
