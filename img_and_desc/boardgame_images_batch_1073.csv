Many alchemists are trying to figure out how to make Rainbow ore from different minerals. Every day these alchemists have to find the necessary ore. But finding the required ore is not an easy task. They may have to rely on some luck sometimes. Sometimes it may be ore, But sometimes it might get a stone.&quot;&#10;&#10;Prime Stone is an educational board game designed for classroom use. The game rules are simple enough to develop calculating skills, which are a necessary basis for learning mathematics at a higher level. The prime Stone game can be used to educate about integer factorization and review content such as the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, prime numbers, composite numbers, powers, and other related topics. Teachers can use it to schedule classroom activities and play outside of school hours. Parents can play with their children to help them improve their math skills.&#10;&#10;Players can choose to do one of three things: Pick, Mix and Build. Details are as follows: 1) Take two tiles from the bag and place them in front of the player. If the player picks up one stone tile, the player places the picked tile in front and puts the stone tile back into the bag. 2) Combine two or three tiles placed in front of the player using Multiply and put the old and new tiles back into the bag. 3) Create Rainbow ore from the target card. Using two or three tiles placed in front of the player multiplies any number of the target cards. Players can use those two or three tiles to create rainbow ore by having the player put the tile used to create it back into the bag. Then put the target card in front of the player and put the number of stone tiles specified in the target card into another player's bag. (will give stone tiles all with one player or distributed to multiple other players) and then open a new target card to replace it.&#10;&#10;There are two conditions to ending the game, either 1) the player generates eight rainbow ore or 2) the player collects four target cards. When one of the players meets the condition, play that round as the last round and count rainbow ore number. The player with the most number of rainbow ore is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Designed by Joe Schmidt, Henry aims to create a more streamlined version of Levy &amp; Campaign that is equally suitable for someone&rsquo;s first experience  or a quicker lunchtime gaming session.&#10;&#10;The English player will build their army at the outset of the game, and in doing so set their victory conditions based on these choices, and then begin their campaign. While the English march through Normandy, the French Nobles will need to rapidly respond by levying their forces and navigating the internal court politics of their ongoing civil war between the Armagnac and Burgundian factions. Then, once ready for battle, the French will attempt to hunt down and prevent King Hal and his happy few from returning home.&#10;&#10;The Levy &amp; Campaign system offers us something more focused on the human element. Humans need to be fed, and that food needs to be both secured and transported. Without that, even the greatest of armies will fail. Henry endeavors to lift the veil of the mythology of the Battle of Agincourt to offer a more detailed look into the circumstances that created the legend.&#10;&#10;"

Determined to make the most of the five weeks you've been granted, you've pledged to spend the time mapping Mihi Anguli, an obscure and uncharted patch of the night sky. But beware! Your colleague and nemesis Dr. Rivalis is eager to piggyback off of your success. For you to prevail, you must learn new abilities, gain supporters, and publish your findings. Only then will the world see you as the superior astronomer. Now go forth, and carpe noctem!&#10;&#10;My Corner of the Sky is a roll &amp; write game, released in Spring 2022 by Dave Mansell as a free print &amp; play. It features an innovative dice mechanic wherein the pip layout of your dice matters as much as the value shown. It has two pages of rules and one game sheet. The only other needed components are a pencil (or pen) and 4 standard 6-sided dice (with pips).&#10;&#10;This is a solo game but can also be played as multiplayer, with all players using the same rolled dice values.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The heart of the game however is really all about using your cards to effectively get in the other player's way and stop them from getting there before you or steal their points if they get to 10,000 first.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
