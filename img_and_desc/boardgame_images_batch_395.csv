In each round every player tries to collect a precise set of cards, called a phase, by drawing cards from the deck and discarding unneeded ones. When a player collects the phase, he lies it down on the table. After that he tries to discard all of his remaining cards by adding them to any of the phases that are already on the table. When the first player discards all of his cards, the round ends. The players who have lied down their phases get to the next phase. And those, who didn't manage to complete the Phase remain in it and in the next round try to collect and lie down the same phase. The game ends with the round in which some player completes the 10th phase.&#10;&#10;The phases consists of sets (two or more cards with the same number showing on their face), runs (three or more cards numbered in order), cards of the same color and runs of cards of the same color. The phases are:&#10; 1. 4 pairs (sets of two cards)&#10; 2. 6 cards of the same color&#10; 3. 1 set of four cards and 1 run of four cards&#10; 4. 1 run of eight cards&#10; 5. 7 cards of the same color&#10; 6. 1 run of nine cards&#10; 7. 2 sets of four cards&#10; 8. 1 run of for cards of the same color and 1 set of three cards&#10; 9. 1 set of five cards and 1 set of three cards&#10;10. 1 set of four cards and 1 run of three cards of the same color&#10;&#10;Main differences from Phase 10:&#10;Different more challenging phases.&#10;Different sort of wild cards.&#10;More action cards.&#10;Different calculation of points.&#10;&#10;Description on the box: The long awaited game is finally here!

Each turn zombies feed and randomly spread throughout your territory, quickly reducing your population and increasing the number of zombies. At the beginning of the game you have no technologies or military that are effective against the viral threat on a worldwide scale.  Each turn you must maximize the use of resources to draft and use military, test technologies, and then strategically use these successfully tested technologies.  As the game progresses, outbreaks and the spread of zombies makes the game more difficult through a loss of population, resources, and freedom to act.  However, if you have been an effective leader you will have developed effective technologies that you may use to try and eliminate the threat from your territory completely. Otherwise leaders will find the game ends with the total conversion of their population into the walking dead.&#10;&#10;"

World War 2 in Europe (USE) is a strategic level game covering the World War II European Theater. Players make the political decisions and control the military forces of the three major factions that struggled for European dominance and survival.&#10;&#10;With its emphasis on force projection and decision making, players remain focused on the big picture of managing their front lines and political opportunities. Through simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the strategic action without a myriad of complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.&#10;&#10;As one gamer put it, &quot;It is a delight to be spending my limited brain power on making (or agonizing over) operational decisions that are as dependent upon guts as they are gray matter. This game is not a series of arithmetic exercises, and the only variable in these algorithms is nerve.&quot;&#10;&#10;Though the focus is on the big picture, Unconditional Surrender! still delivers historical detail. Each country has an historical army level order of battle, and its relative economic strength and national will to fight are effectively and simply modeled. Also represented are such World War II events as airdrops, Free Forces, jets, naval evacuation, partisans, radar, railroad artillery guns, and ULTRA; all neatly woven into the game's core mechanics for ease of play&#10;&#10;The game has many scenarios ranging from quick playing individual campaigns to longer ones covering up to the entire war.&#10;&#10;Design Highlights&#10;&#10;     Scale: army, fleet, or air wing level units; 30-60 miles per hex; monthly turns &#10;     Players: 2-4&#10;     Playing Time: 30 minutes to 50 hours, depending on the scenario&#10;     Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is relatively low.&#10;     Simple Stacking: No more than one air, ground, convoy, or warship unit per hex.&#10;     No Factors on Counters: There are no combat or movement factors on counters.&#10;     Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air/naval, ground, or strategic combat. &#10;     Integrated Movement/Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation. &#10;     &quot;Use it or Lose it&quot; Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping&#10;     Historical or Variable Entry: Units and events can enter play using an historical or variable time line. &#10;     Variable Politics: Most countries&rsquo; belligerence and faction alliance is not predetermined.&#10;     Solitaire Friendly: Though not designed with solitaire rules, the mechanics easily allow one player to play the game.&#10;     PBEM Capable: The game can be played using PBEM software, but its mechanics require frequent exchanges.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;&#10;        840 counters on 3 countersheets&#10;        Two 22&quot;x34&quot; maps&#10;        Three 11&quot;x17&quot; Player Aid Sheets&#10;        Three 8.5&quot;x11&quot; Faction cards&#10;        Two 8.5&quot;x11&quot; Flowchart cards&#10;        Rulebook&#10;        Playbook&#10;        Three six-sided dice &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:    Monthly Turns&#10;MAP SCALE:     30 to 40 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Army, Fleet or Wing&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Salvatore Vasta&#10;DEVELOPER: Mark Dey&#10;MAP ART: Salvatore Vasta &amp; Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART: Charlie Kibler&#10;&#10;(from the designer and GMT Games website)&#10;&#10;"

Each turn a player draws a card and performs an action such as constructing a building, buying resources from the bank, or sending a cat with fleas into a rival kingdom.&#10;&#10;Each turn you are faced with the choice of building up your kingdom or ruining someone else's.

Everybody needs minions, it&rsquo;s just a pity they are an unpredictable and fickle lot. Minions construct your buildings for you and generally moan a lot of the time. &lsquo;We are bored!&rsquo; they cry so you build them a den of iniquity.

The idea was to create a set of skirmish rules that were quick to play, fun, colourful and different to other rule sets. We wanted to play games featuring mythical warriors such as Robin Hood, Achilles and King Arthur, and historical legends like Alexander of Macedon, Frederick Barbarossa and William the Conqueror.&#10;&#10;The focus of development was therefore to create rules that favoured the heroes and legends of past centuries at the expense of the common soldier. Death or Glory (DoG) does this, and makes such heroes and legends quite literally deadly on the tabletop. BUT, and this is a big but, they are not unbeatable. If you charge King Arthur into a unit of enemy warriors on his own, with no support or strategy and it&rsquo;s going to hurt - or could even be fatal! But use him as he should be, a legendary fighter, and he will carve his away around a battlefield - just as he does in the movies.&#10;&#10;The idea is to use DoG to re-enact scenes from a movie, book or graphic novel, or make up your own encounters using lots of models. Whether you have Leonidas cutting a path through Persian Immortals to save an injured companion, or Jason trying to fight his way through skeletons to the safety of his ship, DoG is perfect for recreating such encounters.&#10;&#10;This rulebook loosely covers the Dark Ages, as the statistic cards that are provided are for fairly generic European warriors with chain armour and large shields. There are also two specific lists with statistic cards for Norse and Saxon warriors. Additional supplements and/or downloads will be made available from the Downloads section of this web site.&#10;&#10;The DoG rules have now been fully playtested and are being designed, ready for printing. We anticipate that shops will have stock of the rule book in late 2009. DoG will be a full colour, perfect bound 96-page book.&#10;&#10;"
