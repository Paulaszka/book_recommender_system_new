Players will choose attributes and goals for their characters from a hand of cards and will then pick from one of two scenarios: &quot;Lab of the Mad Wizard&quot; or &quot;Shopping with Humans.&quot;&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, the other players pick one of the active character's attributes and one of her goals and narrate a scene of how that attribute gets the character into trouble while she pursues the goal. Then, the active player must describe the character's attempt to get out of that trouble and meet the selected goal using her other attribute.&#10;&#10;For example, let's say your group is playing the scenario &quot;Lab of the Mad Wizard.&quot; Your character has the attributes &quot;Short term memory loss&quot; and &quot;Sarcasm&quot; and the goals of &quot;Needs to burn the place down (even just a little bit)&quot; and &quot;Wants to hurt the feelings of character on right.&quot; The other players might narrate a scene in which you completely forget where you are and what you are doing and then notice a book of matches on the table. You start playing with the matches, which draws the attention of a quivering tower of sentient slime who wants to swallow you and your pretty matches. Now you must narrate your character's effort to get out of this situation using her sarcasm while she tries to meet her goal of burning the place down. Can you manage to crack a sarcastic remark that gets you away from the monster while lighting fire to something?&#10;&#10;More importantly, can you tell the tale convincingly enough that the other players will vote for your success? They will decide if your attempt was successful or not and whether or not your goal was met, and they will narrate the results accordingly.&#10;&#10;Players WIN who manage to meet the goals of their characters before four rounds have passed, and they celebrate by narrating the fates of their characters freely. Players LOSE whose character's goals are not met before the end of four rounds, and they must narrate the deaths of their characters.&#10;&#10;"

What they do not have in abundance is time.  The island and its vital airfields must be conquered quickly to allow the 77th Infantry Division to be transferred to Okinawa as soon as possible.  Even so the American side must achieve its mission with no more than a modest number of casualties otherwise the 77th will be in no condition to relieve the 96th Infantry Division on Okinawa as it did historically.  An economy of force approach must be adopted and assets such as air power, armor, artillery, and the American Navy all used to maximum efficiency.&#10;&#10;The Japanese player has a mixed bag of forces ranging from regular army units to airfield construction personnel to island civilians.  Defeating the invasion at the landing beaches isn&rsquo;t the goal so much as making the invaders pay as high a price as possible.  With this in mind the Japanese player must focus their defense on the best terrain&mdash;primarily Mount Gusuku and the urban areas adjacent to it&mdash;but always be on the lookout for opportunities to upset the American timetable with judicious placement of machine gun nests and pockets of civilian resistance behind American lines.  The island&rsquo;s artillery possesses the capability to inflict attritional losses on the invaders, and the threat of a kamikaze attack on the 5th Fleet is something the American player must account for.  The arrival of night each turn opens the door for small Japanese assaults which, along with satchel charges, might produce a local victory as happened historically at Bloody Ridge, or at the very least see the American player surrendering control of the advantage marker to demand a reroll.  Changes in the weather are random, but the arrival of rain benefits the Japanese side, as does the appearance of rubble in urban areas.&#10;&#10;An optional rule allows players to experience the uplifting presence of Ernie Pyle being close to the front and the leadership provided by Major Igawa personally joining the combat, though at the risk of seeing these historical figures killed in action.&#10;&#10;Game components: one cover sheet, one 22&rdquo;x17&rdquo; unmounted map, one countersheet of &frac12;&rdquo; counters, and a rulebook; all in a bag.&#10;&#10;"

Each turn a new adventure card is drawn from the current Act deck of your quest. The acts are The Fellowship, Journey, and Destination.&#10;&#10;Each turn a new player acts as the Adventure Master (AM). Players, except the AM, chooses a talk card from their hand and plays it face down.&#10;&#10;The AM then draws a random talk card from the talk card deck and shuffles it in with the players' chosen talk cards.
