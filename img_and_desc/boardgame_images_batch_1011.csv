Nazi Germany swiftly responds by occupying the northern part of its former ally, by disarming its army (Operation Achse), and by freeing and reinstating Mussolini as the leader of the fascist Italian Social Republic puppet state. Several elements of the dissolved Regio Esercito refuse to comply, flee to the Alpine and Apennine foothills, and take up arms against the nazifascist occupation. Like in most other German-occupied European countries, they will soon be joined by anti-fascists and rebels, giving rise to the first formations of the Italian partisan resistance warfare, which will quickly reorganise themselves as &quot;brigades&quot; and oppose the fascist regime until the liberation of April 1945.&#10;&#10;In the summer of 1944, after the breaching of the Gustav Line and the liberation of Rome, a new frontline is established along the northern ranges of the Apennines, from the Adriatic to the Tyrrhenian sea. The so called &quot;Gothic Line&quot; will stand until the end of the war. During these dramatic months, the areas around  the Gothic line will witness some of the most ferocious reprisals of the European war, often involving directly the civilian population.&#10;&#10;Resistenza! is a cooperative boardgame that relates the partisan struggles in and around the small valley of Lunigiana, tucked in between the Apennines and Alpi Apuane in the western-most portion of the Gothic line, from the standpoint of the partisan brigades.&#10;&#10;The game is tactical in nature, reflecting the fluidity of guerilla warfare, although several game decisions have broader, strategic consequences. The brigades must ambush convoys along the valley's main communication lines, thwart nazifascist reprisals against civilians and participate in the final liberation battles. Attacks are resolved by committing combat cards against enemy tiles of unknown value (unless scouted by previous reconnaissance). Materiel airdrops are also represented, through the drop of a die on the game map. The design focus is on evocation over simulation, implying a certain degree of abstraction. A semi-cooperative and a simplified version of the game are also included, as well as a booklet of historical and design notes.&#10;&#10;The proceeds from the game will support the activities of Archivi della Resistenza and the running of the Audiovisual Museum of the Resistance (Fosdinovo, MS, Italy) .&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players are trying to get attractive groupings of dolphins in frame at the right time to get their photo. The best composed shots win the most points.&#10;&#10;The game has a long blue cord which is placed as a loop on the table. The frame is set up in front of this, and a blue background is put to the rear. Players then throw a number of blue dice into the loop. These determine which marine animals appear. The number and types of dolphins are limited and will not appear all the time. The cutouts are clipped at different levels to blue poles, and these are stuck to small platforms which go alongside the corresponding dice. Looking through the frame, the players can see some creatures in shot, but not all of them. In this way, players compose a shifting three dimensional diorama of sea life passing the frame of the camera.&#10;&#10;Players have to chose when to take a good photo. Should they get a quick snap, or wait a bit in case a more interesting creature swims by. Will the enormous whale shark appear at the back?

Each round, players receive eleven cards to play ten tricks. During the tricks, the leader plays a suit and the rest of the players follow with a card of the same suit, if possible. Whoever plays the strongest card of the strongest suit wins the trick and collects it for scoring! Meanwhile, whoever plays the lowest on-suit card gets to visit the Bug Council; this player chooses a faction tile, collects its strength cubes, then distributes them in a clockwise fashion around the council, thus altering the strength of the suits.&#10;&#10;At the end of ten tricks, players use their remaining card to claim their allegiance to the faction matching its suit. If you play your cards right and manipulate the council to your favor, you can get a nice allegiance bonus to add to the tricks you've won.&#10;&#10;At the end of three rounds, whoever has the most points wins the game and will be forever remembered in the annals of Backyardia history!&#10;&#10;"

At your disposal is a fleet of chronoships, capable of traversing all four dimensions of space and time. You will hunt through all of history to hire the brightest minds to your cause, and each will be given command of one of your precious chronoships.  However, you are not the only one with a grand vision for the future and must watch out for rivals, who will attempt to meddle with your plans!&#10;&#10;The aim of this worker placement game is to be the first to complete three Butterfly Effect Missions. These are iconic moments in history, from the rise of the Roman Empire to the Industrial Revolution, from the Second World War to the colonisation of Mars. Each Butterfly Effect Mission will require knowledge to be collected or technology to be developed.&#10;&#10;In Utopia, each player will start by drafting two crew-members to activate their first two Chronoships. These crew-members will be famous people from history or the future and each will have different primary and secondary abilities. Primary abilities enhance the collection of one of five types of knowledge: Military, Exploration, Science, Politics or Culture. Secondary abilities come in 13 varieties which will help the player to compete with their rivals, ranging from Merchants to Medics, from Spies to Superstars.&#10;&#10;It is possible to control an additional three Chronoships by recruiting new crew-members to command them. Chronoships travel through wormholes to visit different locations in space and time, known as Time Zones (TZs). There are 12 TZs in total, TZ1 represents the ancient past, whereas TZ12 represents the distant future. New Alternate TZs will also spawn throughout the game, the &ldquo;Butterfly Effect&rdquo; of players meddling with the space-time continuum.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

To escape, players must try to drop their cheese in other players&rsquo; stashes as quickly as possible. Are you one of the amateurs who always tries to drop one cheese at a time? Or, are you the profound mastermind who dares to cheese others three or more cards in a shot? After three rounds of tossing and gobbling, the player who has the most escape points wins the game. Are you ready to cheese?&#10;&#10;Goal:&#10;&#10;The goal is to have as few cards as possible. During the round, play cards to other players' stashes by either playing multiple cards of the same number or a run of three or more cards. The round ends when a player is out of cards. Players  receive escape points based on the number of cards in their hand and stash. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins the game. In case of a tie, the tied players share the win.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

If a player is the first to land on one of the numbered spaces, he draws the card from the deck of 30 cards and reads out the information on the pink side of the card. Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.&#10;&#10;When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished. The others play on. When all the players have reached the 30 space, the 'won' cards are added up and the winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;"
