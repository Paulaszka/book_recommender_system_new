In order to move their frog-pieces from the &quot;Start&quot; lilypad to the &quot;Finish,&quot; Morphologists must put on their creative thinking-caps to build words like &quot;bike&quot; and &quot;snow&quot; using the 35+ game pieces provided (see below for details). The game mixes some &quot;original&quot; Morphology rules like &quot;Everybody Play&quot; and &quot;Pick 5&quot; with some new adaptations, including &quot;Morph&quot; (where the Morphologist becomes a piece in the game) and &quot;Ribbit, Ribbit&quot; (where the Morphologist can make noises to help his/her teammates guess the right word).&#10;&#10;....&#10;&#10;In Morphology Junior, players form into up to 4 teams.  Each team gets a delightful plastic team frog marker to mark their place along the lilypad themed game board.&#10;&#10;After deciding if the players will use the easy or hard sides of the clue cards (or perhaps kids use easy and adults use hard?) the first team to play chooses their first Morphologist who will create the word on the card from a collection of bits including colored cubes, a black string, glass baubles, wooden planks and little wooden 'people'.&#10;&#10;In basic play, the Morphologist is a puppeteer and cannot spell out words or symbols, make any sounds other than a small amount of grunting and encouraging for guess feedback, and cannot interact directly with the pieces.  The rulebook gives the example of 'toothbrush' and how the Morphologist can't pretend to brush their own teeth but they can brush the teeth of the little wooden figure.&#10;&#10;Some of the lily pad spaces can change this though.  Everyone Plays allows both teams to guess what the current Morphologist is building.  Interception allows an opposing team to guess if the current team doesn't guess correctly by the time the timer runs down. Morph! allows the Morphologist to be a piece as well, so go ahead and brush YOUR teeth!  Pick 5 forces the Morphologist to choose just 5 props to use after looking at the word. Pick 5 + 1 however allows the opposing teams to choose the 5 props and the Morphologist gets to add just one more prop after reading the word.  And finally there is Ribbit! Ribbit! where the Morphologist can make noises!&#10;&#10;Correct guesses allow a team to move their frog to the next lily pad.  First team to get their frog to the final lily pad wins!&#10;&#10;"

Players acquire resources, construct buildings and, after twelve rounds, score the total value of their buildings and their money in cash.&#10;&#10;Each round, a set of new, predefined buildings is added to the market. Both players now take turns by either building one of these buildings or by using an existing building's effects. To construct a building, players have to pay a certain amount of money and/or resources from their warehouse. Most of these buildings, in turn, allow to change the amount of resources on a player's warehouse board in a specific way when used. This is crucial to the game as players are restricted on how to fill or empty their warehouse. They have to combine and optimize these steps to max out the capacity of their warehouses. Players can even use their opponent's buildings, but they have to pay them one Franc (=money) to do so. When a building is not used during a round, it steadily increases in worth as its effects can be used up to four times in subsequent rounds. But a building that is not used for too long has to be sold to the market for half its value! The game uses an Ora et Labora-like wheel to track this status of each building in play.&#10;&#10;Although Le Havre: The Inland Port shares gameplay elements with Ora et Labora and is linked in theme with Le Havre, it is a distinct game with its own mechanisms and gameplay.&#10;&#10;"

Soon, a human starship found the Nexus, by the simple process of noticing the alternate exit point while traversing one of those wormholes. The commercial and navigational value of the nexus was obvious, and the humans began exploiting the asteroid field surrounding the exit point. They hollowed out the largest asteroid creating the core module in preparation for building a full-blown space station. Led by those same wormholes, other starships soon showed up. Then more. Now all alien civilizations want access to the Nexus. Rather than see bloodshed, the humans, ensconced in place, offered to let all share the Nexus peacefully. The humans would build the space station modules, ensuring compatibility, but the aliens would purchase and own the modules themselves.

Over 150 divisions &ndash; ca. 3,6 million troops &ndash; of the Axis invaded the USSR along a front of 2,900 km. In addition to troops, Barbarossa involved 600,000 motor vehicles, 750,000 horses, 3350 tanks, 7300 guns, and nearly 2000 planes &ndash; the largest invasion in the history of warfare.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN THE EAST is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the strategic level. It recalls the most decisive battles fought on the Eastern Front from the beginning of the invasion in summer 1941 until the dramatic end in Berlin in spring 1945. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II.&#10;&#10;The game is recommended for two or four players: one/two control the Soviet Red Army and the other one/two control Germany and the other Axis powers. In a threesome, one player controls one faction while the other two players control the other faction. The game is furthermore suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, a play with Fog of War is suggested.&#10;&#10;Developed with a system of wooden blocks and cubes and played out over an astonishing 125x87 cm (49&quot;x34&quot;) full laminated multicolor mapboard, the only paper component in the box is the rules manual. In total, more than 600 wooden/plastic components have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted &quot;A buratto&quot;, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories.&#10;&#10;The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time:&#10;&bull; The Basic Game Rules introduce the basic concepts of BITE and enable players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember.&#10;&bull; The Advanced Game Rules provide more specific and detailed rules for enhanced realism, such as the use of Fuel and the Advanced Production System.&#10;&bull; The Optional Rules are for those who want to get the most out of the game, with rules for Technology Research, Strategic Warfare with the bombing of Germany and U-boat campaigns in the oceans, Amphibious Landings, Airborne Assaults, and more.&#10;&#10;In BLOCKS IN THE EAST, a hexagon is approximately 53 miles (70 km) across, a turn is 1 month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally corps size) with 300 planes, 300 tanks, or 30,000 men, depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc. The game can be played with &quot;Fog of War&quot; on (with the faces of wooden blocks hidden from the opponent) or off (all units are visible).&#10;&#10;Players can compete in the full 1941 Codeword Dortmund Campaign, in one of four six-turn scenarios (&quot;Operation Barbarossa 1941&quot;, &quot;Case Blue - The Drive to Baku 1942&quot;, &quot;Operation Citadel - The Battle of Kursk 1943&quot; and &quot;Bagration Offensive in Summer 1944&quot;), or one of the shorter, easy-to-learn scenarios (&quot;Road to Rostov&quot;, which lasts six turns, or any of these scenarios: &quot;Road to Leningrad&quot;, &quot;Road to Moscow&quot; or &quot;Short Barbarossa&quot;). Each scenario has different victory conditions and length, with a playing time from 1 to 49 turns.&#10;&#10;BLOCKS IN THE EAST can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the West and Blocks in Afrika.&#10;&#10;"

Each player in turn passes one intersection. Each intersection is a double sided tile. One side has an intersection where no right turn is allowed. The other side shows an intersection where no left turn allowed. Driving straight ahead is always allowed. Each time a car has passed an intersection, its tile is flipped. The first player to pass all 16 intersections wins. The cars cannot be both on the same tile at the same time. A player who has nowhere to go (his car can only drive off the grid, or on a blocked tile) loses the game. During the setup phase of the game, each player determines the initial state of half of the grid.&#10;&#10;This game was published as a prize question in the Dutch magazine Pythagoras (issue 51/3, Jun 2012).

The game has two distinct roles: the role of the Guardian who builds a dungeon and the role of the Hero who builds a party of adventurers to loot the dungeon built by the Guardian.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game the Guardian secretly designs a dungeon using a set of 16 room cards. Additional room cards are set aside and drawn from as the game progresses. There are 4 basic room types: Traps, Brutes, Evil and Magic. Brute and Evil rooms are more common and Magic and Trap rooms less common. Each room in the game is unique and has specific ways in which it can assist in the dungeon defense. For example, some rooms, like the RUST BEAST, destroy items, others, like the PRISON CELL, give the HERO player an addition adventurer if the room is captured by the HERO. In addition, there are empty rooms that when coupled with other rooms create a modifier to the chance of that room being overtaken. The Treasure Vault is the most valuable of those rooms and the goal is to keep the adventurers from finding and capturing it. Once the Guardian places entrances outside the dungeon, the game begins.&#10;&#10;Within a round, players spend tokens to take actions in an alternating sequence. The game combines elements of chance with your ability to read your opponent's strategy. The Guardian and Hero do not HAVE to take an action and can pass and wait to see what the other is doing, however, each round the Guardian has last option which means he or she can act last forcing the hero to either act, or end their turn and turn over all but 1 of their action tokens. In addition, the Hero has first option, meaning if both players wish to act first in a round, the Hero gets to go first.&#10;&#10;Each player has action tokens to spend on a variety of actions. Players use tokens to make plays during a round. After all players have spent their tokens, a new round begins with a new set of tokens.&#10;&#10;The Heroes use tokens to prepare adventurers, and move them through the dungeon. Actions include: scouting a room (a less lethal option but slower and thus can waste precious time), venturing a room (a potentially lethal action where the hero charges adventurers into a room), play a card (spell, item or adventurer), draw a card, retreat, or pass. Heroes earn points by defeating rooms. The Guardian uses action tokens to build more rooms into the dungeon, alter room locations in the dungeon, create dungeon effects to slow down the Hero's progress, or draw cards from the dungeon deck. Each card drawn brings the game closer to the end, because when the dungeon deck is emptied the game ends. The Guardian earns points by capturing adventurers and their gear, and by keeping his dungeon rooms from being captured. The game ends either when the Guardian has drawn all the dungeon cards or when the Hero captures the Treasure Vault.&#10;&#10;A major component of the game is how the Hero moves through the dungeon and captures rooms. The Hero must enter from one of the 2 entrances, and then must always move to rooms that are adjacent (not DIAGONAL) to the entrance, or adjacent to any cleared room connected to the entrance by other cleared rooms. To clear a room the Hero uses action tokens to form a party. Selecting between 1 and 4 of his adventurers with skills suited for the room at hand. The Hero can save time by charging into an unknown room or use action tokens to scout the room and then pick the best party for the job. The advantage of charging is that it saves time and throws off the Guardian, however, it can mean certain death. Scouting is safer, but eats precious time. The Hero is trying to put the best adventurers in the rooms most suited to their skills&mdash;while the Guardian tries to ambush and surprise the Hero with rooms that challenge the adventurers. This is where spells (for the Hero) and Dungeon Effects (for the Guardian) help tip the scales of a close combat. The 4 basic Adventurers WARRIOR, ROGUE, WIZARD, and CLERIC each have a room they are best at defeating. However, they are also capable and somewhat skilled in other rooms. In addition they each have a power which gives them strategic advantages, for example the warrior is better at venturing, the rogue at scouting, the wizard can cast spells without eating action points, and the cleric can save party members by sacrificing himself. Using their skills and talents at the right time in a well balanced group can mean the difference between a wipe-out and a victory. Of course, the Guardian can see the party composition and their equipment, but the Hero cannot see what is in the rooms. So the Guardian is constantly shifting and bolstering his rooms to create the most havoc for the party at hand.&#10;&#10;Equipment also scores points for the Guardian if captured, but is important to boost the adventurers skills vs. various rooms. It also takes time (action tokens) to equip. The advantage of the bonus vs. the consumption of time becomes a key strategic choice.&#10;&#10;In a multi-player game there are multiple Heroes who each take a turn in sequence against the Guardian. Each Hero builds a party of adventurers and equips them separately. In the end if the Heroes have more combined points they win as a team against the Guardian. The game currently can play 1 to 3 Heroes vs. 1 Guardian.&#10;&#10;"

This turned out to be a mistake, and subsequently the wagon train became trapped by early winter snow blocking the Fr&eacute;mont Pass in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The pioneers made camp to wait out the winter at Truckee Lake and Alder Creek.  Starvation, illness and even cannibalism took their toll, and out of the 87 original members of the Donner Party only 48 made it out alive.&#10;&#10;Players each control a family of pioneers with the goal of reaching California.  The game starts in November of 1846 with food supplies dwindling and more winter storms on the horizon.  Each player receives a cabin and six pioneer dice that represent your pioneers' conditions: Healthy, Lean, Starving, Sick (Dying) or Dead.  Each round starts with an event after which players take turns placing their pioneers on action spaces until the Starvation Phase when they need to feed their families with food tokens and heat their cabins with wood tokens.&#10;&#10;Player interaction is maximized by the Beg action which takes food or wood from another player and the Desperation action which is how to draw and play Desperation cards that are either beneficial for the player or punish opponents.  Some card effects and actions to gain food earn player cannibalism tokens, which penalize a player's score at the end of the game. Periodically during the game a Rescue event occurs and players must choose whether to gamble some of their pioneers on a risky rescue attempt over Fr&eacute;mont Pass or wait until the thirteenth turn of the game when all pioneers left in their cabins are automatically scored.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to deliver as many of your six pioneers as you can to Sutter's Fort alive and minimize your cannibalism token penalty.&#10;  &#10;  &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one.&quot; -Spock, The Wrath of Kahn.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's fun to get together and have something good to eat at least once a day.&quot; -Julia Child&#10;&#10;"

Border War is a solitaire game that puts you in the middle of that fighting as commander of a South African battlegroup based on the frontier. You conduct raids into Angolan territory, seize enemy base camps and, just as important, return to home base.&#10;&#10;The game includes two decks of cards. The Mission Cards provide scenario objectives and the resources with which battlegroups are assembled. The missions are drawn from historic cross-border raids, such as Operations Protea and Modular. You recruit from a variety of unit types, including recon, commandos, mechanized infantry, paratroopers, G-5 long-range artillery, and air support.&#10;&#10;Border War is part of the Commando mini-game series. Once a battlegroup is organized, you move it across the border. When a force enters certain points an Event Card is picked. Events can include anything from special intelligence information to the appearance of major enemy forces. There&rsquo;s a range of foes, from SWAPO insurgents and Angolan government regulars to powerful Cuban armored formations. Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure in which both tactical superiority and firepower play their parts. There are special rules for helicopter reaction forces, PSYOP, and leaders.&#10;&#10;"

Leading the first of those campaigns was the great general, Flavius Belisarius. Belisarius&rsquo;s War is a two-player game of the Vandal War, in which the Eastern Romans reconquered North Africa. One player commands the Romans, the other the Vandals. Both players maneuver units representing elite regulars, tribal warbands, fleets and militia. The point-to-point map covers North Africa as well as the islands of the Western Mediterranean.&#10;&#10;In Belisarius&rsquo;s War each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate recruits, movement abilities, special bonuses for combat, and historical events. Some of the cards include: Naval-Land Campaigns, Organize the Exarchate, Ambush, and Procopius.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. Each side has unique advantages, with fierce Vandals pitted against disciplined Roman heavy cavalry. There are special rules for Huns, rebellions, morale and leaders such as Belisarius. Having the right commander at the right battle can mean the difference between victory and disaster.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

George Armstrong Custer and most of his command at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. This two-player game covers that entire campaign.&#10;&#10;One player commands Army forces, including the regiments and battalions forming the three commands that participated in the original campaign: Crook&rsquo;s, Gibbon&rsquo;s and Terry&rsquo;s. The other player controls various Indian tribes, each rated for its fighting strength in warriors. The point-to-point map stretches from Fort Abraham Lincoln in the Dakotas to Helena, Montana. In between are famous historic battle sites such as Powder River, the Rosebud, and the Little Bighorn.&#10;&#10;Custer&rsquo;s Final Campaign is part of the Hand of Destiny mini-game series. Each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate movement abilities, combat bonuses and historical events. Accessing the right card at the right time lets the player concentrate forces to win that great victory against all odds&mdash;or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat. Some of the cards include: Tribal Raiding, Indians Leave Reservation, and Gary Owen.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. There are special rules for: Gatling guns, &ldquo;dog soldiers,&rdquo; Army riverboats, and leaders such as Crazy Horse, Nelson Miles, Sitting Bull and Custer himself.&#10;&#10;"

Cactus Air Force is a two- player wargame covering the air campaign over the Solomon Islands during critical period late in 1942. Both the American and Japanese players move their bombers to attack critical targets while using fighters to struggle for air superiority.&#10;&#10;Each player controls units representing air groups. All of the famous aircraft are here: Japanese Zeroes, Bettys and Oscars, and Allied F4F Wildcats, P-40s, and B-17s. Each unit is rated for air superiority, bombing and speed.

The map covers the entire Solomon Island chain centered on Guadalcanal.&#10;&#10;Cactus Air Force is part of the Air Wars mini-game series. Each player has a deck of Campaign Cards.
