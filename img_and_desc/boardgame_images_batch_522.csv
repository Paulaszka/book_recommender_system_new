Other concepts were also added to shape it, such as handling draws and the use of the pie rule to handle uneven game conditions.  The game was built around these concepts.&#10;&#10;The name of the game comes from the philosopher Heraclitus who said a person never jumps into the same river twice.  The game involves the changing of game conditions from round to round, and a testing of the player's skill to be able to evaluate and manipulate such game conditions to their advantage.&#10;&#10;The base game takes place on half a checkerboard, and each player has 12 pieces each.  In the basic game, if no rules changes are applied, players end up dropping a piece on the board from the reserve, sliding one of their pieces on the board, or swapping one of their pieces with an opponent's piece on the board.  Players capture enemy pieces by jumping.  In the normal game, players win the game by capturing at least 6 enemy pieces.&#10;&#10;This is Game #29 in the Games on Half a Checkerboard Series.&#10;&#10;"

As no other player may submit more than five fairy tales, all other players pass. The player who starts the highest bid must now name 5 fairy tales in the length of time agreed (eg 60 seconds). If successful, He wins the card. Otherwise, the player who had next biggest bid, receives the card.&#10;&#10;If the deck is exhausted the player with the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;If you want to spice up the game, you can also decide that the words of the category will start with a given letter.

Moreover, where the queen of the battlefield in Napoleon's time was the linear Infantry formation, in Order of Arms, the dominant unit up until near the very end of the period covered, was the Mounted Men-at-Arms (MMA); the armored knight; the result of which is that the long playing piece in Order of Arms is the MMA unit.&#10;&#10;Fornovo 1495, the first game in the series presents the battle fought between the French Army of King Charles VIII, and the Condottieri forces of the League of Venice under the command of Francesco II Gonzaga of Mantua.

All pieces may be moved in or out one panel, the Prince can be moved an unlimited number of panels in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, the Baron only clockwise and the Viscount only anti-clockwise. No diagonal moves are permitted and the only piece allowed to move onto a panel already occupied is the King, and this only to capture. The King is the only piece able to capture other pieces. The Crown is gained by moving a piece onto a panel of the same colour and adjacent to the King, who is then demoted and the new Prince is crowned.&#10;&#10;Although not a difficult game to play, Crown Chess does require thought and planning. However, it is rather difficult to formulate strategy because the situation changes so rapidly with four players. The Hints on Play provided advice that the main objective should not be to take the Crown, which should only be done to prevent another player from winning, to prevent possible capture of your pieces or to win the game. As pieces cannot jump over one another, there is a certain amount of aimless movement. and blocks can occur. Princes may not be captured, thus there is no way of forcing them to move. One of the best winning strategies seems to be to move one's Prince onto a panel adjacent to a Gold, keep it protected and wait for other players to blunder, then take the Crown at the opportune moment and make the winning move.&#10;&#10;The game does have many unique concepts and apart from the box is extremely well presented. It is also most decorative though probably beyond the means of most games players (this game cost 18 pounds at the time of release).&#10;&#10;"

Most of these are from 1-3 shots, but there's a variety of special actions, e.g.:&#10;         attacking an entire row or column&#10;         converting all future one-shot cards into salvoes (as in the Salvo game above)&#10;         having the other player tell you a coordinate on their ship to hit&#10;         scanning a row for number of hits (but not exactly where)&#10;         firing one shot, then drawing and playing another card&#10;    &#10;     An &quot;Advanced Special Ops&quot; mode with a hand of the above cards, and two card actions (either draw or play) per turn.  This last one can get confusing, as the rules for the cards are obviously written with the assumption that you're playing one per turn, requiring some house rules to fill in the logical holes.&#10;&#10;&#10;The last wrinkle is Comm Tower cards (which presumably has something to do with the movie) which persist when played.  The first player to collect four of them has their subsequent shots go nuclear, destroying the entire target regardless of size with a single hit.&#10;&#10;The following is manufacturer's marketing copy, or at least written like it is:&#10;&#10;Includes three exciting games in one portable case that&rsquo;s always ready for the battle.

You take on the role of a young captain who has just been given command of his first ship. The game's missions revolve around the the tangled web of political intrigue surrounding Napoleon's plan to invade England.&#10;&#10;The game play focuses on navigation, 1 on 1 sea battles, and assaults by landing parties. The dramatic chases of naval literature are reproduced using an abstract system that represents the relative speed and position of each ship. Each turn the ship that has the highest maneuverability is considered to have the &quot;wind gauge&quot; and gets to move (closer or farther away) and/or attack. The captains navigational and crew assignments choices define his ships maneuverability each turn.&#10;&#10;The primary game play mechanic revolves around the orders you give to your crew. You assign crew to different positions on the ship in anticipation of where you think the wind or the enemy will be. The game is divided into two segments. A &quot;Mission&quot; segment where you navigate on a large map attempting to reach objectives on time and a &quot;Chase&quot; segment where ships engage each other.&#10;&#10;The goal of the system is to simplify naval combat to focus on dramatic storytelling rather than focusing on charts, modifiers,  counters, and complex rules. All conflict resolution is handled by drawing colored cubes from a cup.  This will tell if a test was successful and in combat it also tells what part of the ship is damaged. As a solitaire game the goal is to achieve enough mission objectives to earn renown in order to increase your rank and upgrade your crew.&#10;&#10;"

Each track or run is in two parts, the Base along the edge of the board, and the Approach. Each pair of Base and Approach runs would be of a different colour, but are lettered in the diagram for the purpose of identification. Each player would have a cube, of the same colour as his track. This cube is marked from 1-6 in a similar fashion to a dice, but with ants replacing the usual spots. A collection of ants' eggs with a container and a normal die complete the equipment. The eggs are quite simple to make from papier mache, plaster or a similar substance and painted white.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, the eggs are placed in the container, which in turn is placed in the Queen Ant's Nest in the middle of the board. The cubes are situated in their respective bases with the side showing the six ants uppermost. The die is thrown in turn, and the cubes moved the appropriate number of squares in the direction indicated, along the Base run and then up the Approach run.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach his X on the Ant Nest surround, stops on that square and becomes the Defender of the Queen Ant's Nest. All other ants to reach their X's during that turn become Attackers, and attack the Defender. These attacks are resolved as follows: both players throw the die and the highest score wins, a draw counting as a win for the Defender. When the Defender wins, he remains where he is, and the Attacker returns to that square on his Approach run, having the same number as that thrown by the Defender. If the Attacker wins, he becomes the Defender, while the ousted Defender goes back to the square on his Base run having the same number as that thrown by the Attacker. Should a Defender be beaten by a throw of 6, he is returned to his Base and loses one ant from his group, and so recommences with the new ant group showing face up on the cube. A player with only one ant is knocked out of the game when beaten by an Attacker's throw of 6. On his turn, a Defender must attempt to circumnavigate the Nest, in accordance with throws of the die, and defend himself each time he lands on an opponent's X square containing a cube. When he returns to his own X, he stops (regardless of the throw) and is entitled to collect eggs as follows:&#10;&#10;Size of    &#10;Ant Group&#10;6-5 = 3 eggs&#10;4-3 = 2 eggs&#10;2-1 = 1 egg&#10;&#10;Play continues until all the eggs have been removed from the nest. The initial number of eggs is optional, but an ideal number is 30. The winner is the player having most eggs at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Although it may sound complicated, 'Antheap' is in fact very simple to play. It is well worth going to the trouble of making the board and the cubes, for it will certainly provide the younger members of the family with hours of fun.&#10;&#10;"

The order that the cards are placed in determines how successful the offensive play is. If the defense matches the offense then the defense has guessed the right play and the gain will be minimal. If the offensive play was Halfback around end and the defensive player had that card 4th in order the gain might be 7 yards. If the defense had the card 3rd in order the gain might be reduced to 4 yards. So the closer to the actual play call the defense is, the lower the gain potential.

You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?&#10;&#10;Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces.

During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!&#10;&#10;You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, S.P. Artillery, APC, Infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft.&#10;&#10;While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy SAM and AAA assets?&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy tanks before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it won&rsquo;t be able to fly the next day.&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.&#10;&#10;If you&rsquo;ve played Hornet Leader or Phantom Leader, you&rsquo;ll make an easy transition into Thunderbolt-Apache Leader.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following aircraft:&#10;A-10A Thunderbolt II&#10;A-10C Thunderbolt II&#10;AH-64A Apache&#10;AH-64D Apache Longbow&#10;AH-1 Cobra&#10;F-16 Fighting Falcon&#10;AV-8B Harrier II&#10;AC-130 Spectre&#10;RQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;MQ-1 Predator UAV&#10;&#10;Scheduled Campaigns:&#10;Iraq 1991&#10;Pakistan 2013&#10;Libya 1984&#10;Iran 2014&#10;Taiwan Defense 2008&#10;North Korea 2011&#10;Israel Defense 2001&#10;North Atlantic WWIII 1986&#10;&#10;Thunderbolt-Apache Leader includes the following weapons: Mk.82 Iron Bomb, Mk.83 Iron Bomb, AGM-65 Maverick, AIM-92 Stinger, LAU-68, LAU-61, ECM Pod, AGM-114 Hellfire, AIM-9 Sidewinder, Mk.20 Rockeye&#10;&#10;Target Audience: &#10;This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.&#10;&#10;The game can also be played co-op (like our other Leader games) by splitting-up the aircraft and planning/resolving missions as a team.&#10;&#10;Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each campaign consists of 2 to 6 turns in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each day.&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Thunderbolt/Apache Leader&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Any miniature can touch the ball no more than 3 times, after that you have to use another miniature. If another your miniature touches the ball, the previous miniature regains the maximum touches avalaibility. If you miss the ball, or this touches any of the other side's players, the ball possession passes to the adversary. Other rules include details to address situations like penalties, off-sides, free-kicks and such. This is after all a total Subbuteo-clone even in the popular ruleset that, from the 70s, has seen little or no change at all.&#10;&#10;Anyone not happy with the new Subbuteo 2012 edition can still buy this one then!&#10;&#10;"
