Played on a triangular board made up of triangles.  Each player has three pieces.  A third set of three pieces (white) is available for use by either play.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may move one of your pieces or a white piece.&#10;&#10;The objective is to remove your opponent's pieces from the board or immobilize them.  Unlike chess, your pieces push your opponent's (and White's) pieces around into free spaces.  If no space is free, then the pushed piece is removed.&#10;&#10;This game was developed after appearing in the web comic &quot;Unicorn Jelly&quot;.&#10;&#10;The game's home page : http://www.unicornjelly.com/taasen1.html&#10;&#10;"

It's three crafty cats against one tricky mouse. Who will outsmart whom in this game of chase?&#10;&#10;One player controls the three cats. That player's job is to trap the mouse so it can't make a move (cats win). The other player controls the mouse. The mouse must try to scurry past the cats and get free (mouse wins).&#10;&#10;The cats may only move forward, sideways, and forward diagonally along the inscribed lines on the playing surface. Only one cat may move per turn. The mouse may move in any direction, including backwards, one move per turn.&#10;&#10;Similar to 1 contra 4 (4 gegen 4 und 4 gegen 1)&#10;&#10;"

The object is to get the highest score after six rounds.  Each of the two dice has number on five of the six sides, and a skull on the sixth side.&#10;&#10;Determine which player goes first by any convenient method.  First player rolls both dice.  If no skulls are showing, the player adds the numbers showing to his score for the round.  He he has the option of rolling again, or passing the dice to the next player.  If he passes the dice, his turn is over, and the score he has rolled so far is &quot;protected.&quot;  If he rolls again, he may get more points, but he may also lose all the points he has received so far that round.  A player may continue to roll the dice until he decides to pass them, or until he rolls one or more skulls.  If a player rolls one skull, he loses all the points he has gained that round, and gets a score of zero for the round.  He must then pass the dice to the next player.  If a player rolls two skulls, he loses all the points he as gained that round, and in all previous rounds.  He is completely wiped out, and must start again the next round.  He must pass the dice to the next player.&#10;&#10;After all the players have had a chance to roll the dice, draw a line under the scores to signify that the scores above the line are &quot;protected&quot; (i.e., cannot by wiped out the the roll of a single skull).  Note that each player must roll the dice at least once each round.&#10;&#10;Subsequent rounds:  In the following rounds, players roll the dice in the order of their score so far.  The player with the highest score at they end of the first round will roll first for the second round.  The player with the second highest score will roll second, and so on.  There is an advantage to rolling last, so we give that position to the player who is losing the worst.  If two players are tied for score, they may roll a dice or flip a coin to determine which must roll first.&#10;&#10;At the end of six rounds the player with the highest score wins.  If two players are tied for the highest score, then all players must roll another round.&#10;&#10;Hint:  although the odds of rolling a skull on any one roll are always exactly the same as any other roll, the more times you roll in one round, the more points you are rising on any one roll.&#10;&#10;Flying Buffalo Inc.

No calculating system or tokens are required to play, nor are paper and pens necessary.&#10;&#10;Choosing the 50 cards of your deck is the equivalent of rolling a character in a classical Role Playing Game.&#10;&#10;Choosing the Adventure you are going to play is the same as choosing a storyline. It will set the length, places, events, encounters and goals of the game session.&#10;&#10;When played in short 1 versus 1 arena duels, Corunea feels a bit like a trading card game with dice, still providing a very different pace, actions panel, and tactical focus.&#10;&#10;When played in long 2 versus 2 adventures, Corunea feels more like a role playing game without a game master.&#10;&#10;Here again, the experience is quite different from a tabletop role playing game because of the competitive nature of the adventures.&#10;&#10;&#10;Being focused on your character, Corunea is intuitive and visual, as the actions you undertake are accurately simulated.&#10;&#10;You can nearly see your poisoned blade moving through the defense of your adversary, biting his armor and delivering his venom. You can nearly feel the faharn flowing through you as your call of fire is forming and see... your adversary plunging out of its flames... for this time.&#10;&#10;The arrows fly and you can almost hear their heads exploding on your target's shield, an axe follows, surprising the shield bearer and this time.cutting through his shoulder pad...&#10;&#10;After a Corunea fight, you could draw its story board very accurately, just by illustrating what happened.&#10;&#10;Playing Corunea you don't deal with abstract armies or summons, you are on the front line, your blade cutting through the foes, your mind bending the elements.&#10;&#10;"
