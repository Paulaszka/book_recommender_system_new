Using no more than their knowledge of the Earth, Sun, and stars, the Mayans were able to tabulate days, weeks, months, and years from 3113 BC until December 21, 2012 AD. No one knew why the Mayan calendar ended on that date..&#10;&#10;On December 22, 2012, a small asteroid swung in from the outer solar system and clipped the moon.&#10;&#10;For over a year astronomers had been tracking the asteroid, but due to its small size had not thought it a serious threat. It proved, however, to have a much higher density than expected. Its impact with the moon imparted a distinct 'wobble' to the lunar orbit and ejected megatons of lunar material into Earth orbit.&#10;&#10;Scientists estimate the moon's orbit will return to normal in a few years. But, its erratic orbit will have catastrophic effects on Earth's biosphere during the first year. By the end of 2013, all life on the six northern continents will be extinct.&#10;&#10;Welcome to mankind's last year&hellip;&#10;&#10;Two versions of this game are available:  A PDF (Print and Play) version and a Vassal version.&#10;&#10;"

Games archaeologists and historians disagree hotly about just about every aspect of this game: board size, number and distribution of playing pieces, use of a king piece, age, priority, etc, etc; the list goes on. However, there is evidence that the game existed, both in literature and in archaeological finds. All this disagreement suggests that, as the game traveled out to the far flung regions of empire, it was altered and developed by gamers and gamblers.&#10;&#10;The basic Latrunculi consists of 1, 2, or 3 ranks of opposing pieces (the number differs), on a board divided into squares of a single color; the board itself could be 8x8, 10x10, 12x8, or variations thereof.  The move of the pieces is a matter for discussion: the rook's move, queen's move, king's move from chess, or one square orthogonally have all been suggested.  Capture is made when a piece has opposing pieces on either side of it. The winner is the player who captures all his opponent's pieces, although variations have been suggested, such as getting two pieces to the opponent's back rail.&#10;&#10;As noted above, many variations exist, including a version recently discovered in Colchester (the Roman capital of England, Camulodonum), which includes a 'king' or 'standard' piece. Games of the Hnefatafl family are probably further developments of Latrunculorum. BGG members will no doubt have disagreements, opinions, and variations to add to this 'base-line' summary.&#10;&#10;Moshe Callen is credited as a designer on this game for his work in researching, developing, and formalizing the rules of the game based on historical data for the nestorgames version of this game.&#10;&#10;"

It was inspired by the immune system's ability to surround pathogens.&#10;&#10;Two players, Black and White, take turns to either place or move one of their pieces adjacent to another of their pieces, on an 8x8 board. In order to make a move, the players' formations of pieces must have an open space adjacent to them. The game ends when one player can no longer make a move.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;. A body is an adjacent set of pieces of the same colour. A foreign body is an opponent's body. A body has freedom if at least one of its pieces is adjacent to an empty square.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayAt the start of the game, Black pieces are placed on b6, b7, c7, f2, g2 and g3, and White pieces are placed on b3, b2, c2, f7, g7 and g6.&#10;&#10;Black plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must first move one of their bodies and then add a piece to the board adjacent to one of their bodies.&#10;&#10;The movement of a body involves taking a piece from the body and moving it to a different square adjacent to the body (including squares adjacent to the piece itself). A body cannot move unless it has freedom.&#10;&#10;A body's move may land on a foreign body piece, thus removing it from the board, if that foreign body has no freedom.&#10;&#10;A player wins if their opponent cannot add a piece next turn. This will occur if the opponent has either no remaining pieces on the board or no remaining bodies with freedom.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;NotesThe movement rules result in a pseudopod-like movement which may split a body into two smaller bodies (meiosis). Conversely, movement may result in two or more bodies coalescing.&#10;&#10;Players should strive to surround foreign bodies and eat them away while giving their own bodies as much freedom as possible. Keeping a foreign body surrounded ties up pieces.&#10;&#10;It is thought that cycles cannot occur due to the addition of a piece per turn. Neither player can move on a full board, but the player to place the last piece must by definition win the game.&#10;&#10;"

Figure out the answer in Snowblind, a quasi-strategic Icehouse game for 4 players.&#10;&#10;Object: To maximize your score and minimize your opponents&rsquo; scores by putting pieces in taller and smaller stacks, respectively.&#10;&#10;You Need:&#10;&#10;* Four Icehouse stashes of different colors.&#10;    * An opaque bag (or other opaque container).&#10;    * A 4&times;3 grid. A Volcano board or chess board with some squares blocked off works just fine.&#10;    * Some paper and a pencil for tallying scores at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;On your turn, take a piece out of the bag and put it on the board. When you put a piece on the board, it must point upward. Pieces are played by these rules:&#10;&#10;* Any piece may be placed in a vacant space.&#10;    * A smaller piece may be 'engulfed' by a larger piece if the smaller piece is resting directly on the board.&#10;    * A piece of smaller or equal size may be placed on another piece of equal or greater size.&#10;&#10;Once you have placed a piece, play passes to the left. The game ends when all pieces have been played. After this, all the stacks are scored. Stacks have a value equal to the point value of the pieces in the stack, multiplied by the number of pieces in the stack. Points are tallied separately by color. A piece that is 'engulfed' is scored by the color that&rsquo;s engulfing it, not by the 'owner' of the engulfed piece. Engulfed pieces do not count for being in a stack.&#10;&#10;The player with the highest total at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Several variants to the rules are also available on the website.&#10;&#10;Home Page: http://www.invisible-city.com/play/174/snowblind&#10;&#10;"

The player rolls a d3 to select the question randomly.  If answered correctly, the card is retained by the answerer; if incorrectly, the card is returned to the bottom of the pile.

Game includes a selection of terrain to use on these boards to create battlefields, including six different hills, two different villages, two different farms with farm fields, hedgerows, stone walls, roads, streams, rivers, two forests and a bridge.  Roads, streams, and the forest footprint are in colored felt.  Buildings are painted and cast from resin.  Tree bases are magnetized for secure storage inside the box.&#10;&#10;Boxed set includes rules, charts, two rulers, two ten-sided dice, casualty/morale caps, command/rally counters, deployment/dummy markers scaled to unit base sizes, objective/line of communication markers, and two fully painted, based and flocked Napoleonic armies.&#10;&#10;Each army consists of four line, one light and one elite infantry brigade; two light and one heavy cavalry brigade; three foot and one horse artillery batteries; and one General with two separate lieutenants used for command extension functions.  Each brigade includes a flag of its nationality.&#10;&#10;Infantry is mounted four to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing about 2200 men.  Cavalry is mounted two to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing around 700 men.  Guns are mounted individually, one crew member for a field/horse battery and two crew for a heavy gun.  General is mounted with a foot figure; lieutenants are mounted individuals.&#10;&#10;Figures in the standard starter set are painted &quot;Risk&quot; figures from the &quot;shako&quot; edition of Risk.  Additional painted brigades representing helmeted cavalry, lancers, etc. may be ordered from the producer.  Supplemental terrain boards and terrain elements are also available.&#10;&#10;The rules are playable and concentrate on command and morale.  Units out of vision distance or line of sight are initially represented by hidden deployment markers, revealed as units come within sighting range.  Units may also be assigned to off-board flanking forces and/or reserves.&#10;&#10;Initiative is determined each turn, as are available command points for each army.  Command points may be used either to activate units for movement and combat, or to rally shaken or demoralized units.  Army command diminishes as brigades are demoralized or destroyed.&#10;&#10;The game system allows for considerable expansion and accommodates multiple players on a side.  Entire large battles can be gamed using this system and additional unit, but an interesting game can be played with as few as four or five brigades on a side.&#10;&#10;"

An active player can earn good money by successfully completing the task at hand, but the real money will be made by the onlookers who wager wisely.&#10;&#10;Cowboys who enter the hexagonal rodeo arena will be randomly assigned one of 6 events: Bull-Riding, Bronc-Riding, Barrel-Racing, Calf-Roping, Team-Roping or Steer-Wrestling. These typically are resolved by rolling a die and moving along a predetermined track until the active player completes the task, fails by landing on the wrong space in the races, or can't land on the required spot(s) before the cattle escapes out of the arena in the roping events.&#10; The overall winner of the game will be the one with the most money at the end of it. Exactly when that is has to be decided by the players themselves, as events can be repeated as long as players are willing to enter them, and bet on them.&#10;&#10;Since all the tasks get resolved by die rolling alone, winning cowboys will have been riding little more than their luck, making the Rodeo setting nothing more than a novel theme for a dice betting game, rather than simulating the adrenaline-rush of a genuine wild west gathering,  where skillful cowboys strut their stuff.&#10;&#10;On the upside, with detailed playing pieces and 6 different (and all short) events, your average dice betting game suddenly has become very atmospheric, reasonably varied, and does move on at a brisk pace. And even better, as players can keep betting during the races as long as they can find another player who takes them up on the counter-bet, bet money can move even faster than the bulls, triggering personal rivalry around the table that will make even the wildest rodeo-ride look tame in comparison.&#10;&#10;This light-hearted simulation is aimed less at gamers and more at the family market, and the detail and simplicity of the rules will mean that it is probably most enjoyed by those with younger children to entertain. The suggested lowest age is 6, which might be a bit young to fully understand the complexities of even simple betting odds. There is no real upper limit to the amount of players that can join in, and the more the merrier the betting. But if all cowboys want their own piece, then 6 is the maximum number of entrants.&#10;&#10;"
