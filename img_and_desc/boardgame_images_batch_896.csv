Meanwhile, the factions offer an ongoing resistance as they strive to establish their game ending survival conditions. Combat is quick, based on stats comparison, yet remains diverse from the wide range of abilities. Game flow is fast paced, yet decisions still have depth, including some deck building undertones. Pick up the game and gather your friends. Do you have what it takes to achieve Gaia's ambition?&#10;&#10;"

The focus is on Napoleon III's Italian adventure and 1870 debacle.  However, with a realistic assessment of the characteristics of the different armies, the Crimean, Austro-Prussian and Mexican campaign can be refought. With even more allowance for local eccentricities, the War Between the States and contemporary colonial battles can be accommodated. In fact, the rules dealing with first effect and melee results do reflect consideration of American example. Since the emphasis is on European action, the higher level of organization of European armies of the period is not always known to the gamer new to the period, typical corps structures are shown at the end of these rules.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;This complete rule set/game was first published as an article in Vol. VII, No. 5 of The Courier magazine (1982).&#10;&#10;"

The game was made by Tom Francis and Chris Thursten in 2019. In the game you have a 3x3 grid of number cards and around it you have face cards. The face cards are called royals and the goal of the game is to assassinate all 12 of them. If you manage to do this you win the game. Number cards may only be played on matching or lower numbers. In order to kill a royal, you place a card opposite him/her - which means you have lit the charge on a cannon - and you use the two cards between the trigger and the royal, the &quot;payload&quot;, to do that much damage. Payloads can include any suits when attacking jacks, but must match the color of any queens attacked and the suit of attacked kings. Aces and jokers provide you with special actions.&#10;&#10;"

Renaissance Rivals is a 2-4 player card-driven game that can be played in about an hour, combining streamlined tableau and deck building with an innovative system of tactical movement. Players take on the role of artists of the Italian Renaissance as they move around a &quot;map&quot; of Italy (represented by a 4 x 4 grid of cards), using the cards drawn from their decks to obtain Commissions and complete eight unique Masterpieces. On a typical turn, you will draw four cards from your deck to generate Influence points (which allow you to acquire Commission cards) and Advancement points (required to complete your artist&rsquo;s Masterpieces). Every time you acquire a Commission, you must decide whether to add the card to your deck to generate more resources in future turns, or add it to your Palette to unlock the Skills that will enable you to obtain more valuable Commissions and complete more prestigious Masterpieces. Different kinds of Commissions trigger movement in different directions, so you need to be strategic about the order in which you acquire them. Furthermore, each Masterpiece can only be executed in its designated city (or &quot;map&quot; row), so completing all eight will require strategy and foresight!&#10;&#10;The game ends when any player completes all her Masterpieces, or as soon as a player obtains the most highly prized commission, the rebuilding of the Basilica of St. Peter&rsquo;s.  Victory Points are scored for Commissions remaining in each player's deck and for each completed Masterpiece, and the player with the highest total is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

When several of the same animals are looking in the same direction, they will escape from the net, while any animals on top of them will slide down (tetris-style), which may lead to other groups of animals being able to escape.

Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht&rsquo;s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army&rsquo;s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.&#10;&#10;The Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.&#10;&#10;The Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign &ndash; the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (&ldquo;Hube&rsquo;s Pocket&rdquo;) and the splitting of Army Group South in two&mdash;merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  &#10;Special rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:&#10;&#10;&bull; Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front &ldquo;off&rdquo; and another &ldquo;on&rdquo; to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the &ldquo;RVGK&rdquo; for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.&#10;&bull; German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army&#10;&bull; Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.  The 44 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.&#10;&bull; The importance and difficulty of the Dnepr crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and ferries to be emplaced, all leading to Soviet Bridgehead battles &#10;&bull; Both sides were deploying more and more anti-aircraft assets, modeled with units that make air barrages more difficult.&#10;&bull; Axis Fortress HQ units that enable cut-off units to continue to function and shows the decline of the Wehrmacht, from a mobile warfare army to a defensive army, with limited counterattack capability. KG HQs allow ad hoc mechanized formations to combine to simulate the desperate nature of the struggle.&#10;&#10;The Third Winter features two monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,500 combat units.

The sheep must be helped, so the players in turn offer him different delicacies from the pasture. Try is about studying! The problem is, the Baa Baa Bubbles sheep has developed a peculiar hayfever, and every time it does something wrong, it sneezes bubbles! Weh that, which was then just with feeding off!&#10;&#10;The food tiles lie like a meadow around the sheep, whose back is rubbed with a soapy water before the game starts.

If the sheep can tolerate the offered food without sneezing bubbles, the player may keep the food tile. If not, bubbles will blow in all directions and the tile will have to be returned. Who has collected the most tiles in the end, wins!&#10;&#10;"

Then a black checker in the middle and in a certain starting arrangement the blue and red stones of the two counterparties are placed. The trick: The game board stands on a central inverted pyramid and can be tilted by tapping in one of four directions. If it is your turn, roll the dice and tap. Each of the two players now tries by the clever inclination of the field to be the first to move all his pieces or the black stone through any of the four labyrinth exits from the board. Foresighted tactics are needed here.&#10;&#10;"
