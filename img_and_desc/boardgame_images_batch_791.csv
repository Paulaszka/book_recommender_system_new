ULTRA is a fast-paced game and was designed primarily as a party game that can be enjoyed both from non-boardgames players and hardcore players (we all need a party game in our library!).&#10;&#10;ULTRA can be played as a single match or, if you have multiple players, tournaments can be arranged!&#10;&#10;Unlike others Robot/Wargaming boardgames ULTRA has unique features that you won't see in other boardgames.&#10;&#10;We made up a tailored draft mode that allows you to build your robot relying not only in lucky but also in strategy.&#10;&#10;You have to build your own Arena and fill it with different traps, each game won't be the same!&#10;&#10;Dead players can still play! As a dead player you can perform one out of three actions to change the course of the game!&#10;&#10;As mentioned before, after building you robot through the draft, you have to build the arena by just placing the tiles on table following just one simple rule: each tile has to be connected with at least two squares. Then traps will be randomly picked up and placed by each player wherever they want. Now it's time for players to put the robots into the arena and that's it! You're ready to fight!!&#10;&#10;During your turn you have to perform at least 1 action from 3 available: &#10;&#10;     Attack: Use your main weapon to deal damage to the enemies by rolling dice &#10;     Move: Use your movement points to move around the arena &#10;     Push: Use your movement points to push enemies against walls or move them into traps. If you kill an enemy you will receive 1 Gear Point but, if you have all your Gear Points, you won't over-exceed them. &#10;&#10;&#10;You're dead? Don't leave! Because you can still have a role in the game!

Luckily for him that he brought his distress beacon. Beep.. Beep.. The Beacon&rsquo;s signal went wide and far, and even a spaceship way out there received the emergency call. Now Heroes from all parts of the world are heading to the signal to be the first to escort the King out of the dreadful waters. Swip Swap Heroes: is a casual Tile based board building game, where the aim of the game is, to be the Hero that leads the lost King, back to safety. It might sound easy enough, but you will have to battle Trambambolins, Selfie Sticks, Monsters, other Heroes and much more in order to accomplish glory and fame in the kingdom of Baffleburgh.&#10; In the Tile-laying game Swip Swap Heroes: There are monsters, utility and mechanical tiles to build with, and four Teams to choose from: the Space Monkeys from outer space, The deep diver Nemo and his Octopus, The Pirate Sisters and the Nerdy Adventureres, they all bring a set of unique Tiles to the game. Each player controls a Team of two Heroes. These Teams compete against each other by setting traps, pushing each other over the edge and manipulate the sea by placing Tiles.&#10; In Swip Swap Heroes: your goal is to be the first Hero that brings the King back to safety, by getting to him, and carrying him back to your Team Island, or by holding the King when the enough Sand Tiles have been placed. The King starts in the center of the board (5x5 Tile Layout), and the four Team Islands are placed in each corner.&#10; Each player has 3 dice in their own color, which are used to determine who goes first, and for resolving battles. In Swip Swap Heroes:, each game starts with building the Sea, 20 of the 70 adventure Tiles are evenly handed out between each player. The first player starts by placing the first Tile face down, then the player to his left places a Tile, and so on. When all twenty Tiles are laid down, the race against the tide begins. You have to remember where you placed the helpful Tiles that you have planned to move on and evade your own traps!&#10; On your turn, you have two Heroes that you can act with, each of them can choose between two actions: move or build. When moving on a Tile, it is revealed and resolved. Entering traps or getting pushed over the edge by another player sends your Hero back to your Team Island, where your Hero will be ready again on your next turn. When encountering another Hero, a battle begins, each Hero rolls their dice against each other, the one with the greatest outcome wins, and the opponent falls into the Sea. When you win a battle against another Hero or monster, you earn Fame, Fame are one time use dice that you can collect and choose to use in need. Mechanical Tiles can help you move quickly into the center and the more the board is getting reveal the more strategic it becomes, should you move or build on top of your opponents path and send him into a trap or maybe you should let him get the King and then push him into the Sea?&#10;&#10;The tide rises every time a Sand Tile is placed on top of certain used Tiles such as a Treasure Tile, When the last Sand Tile is placed in the sea the tide has fully risen and the Hero carrying the King at the end of that turn wins the game. Swip Swap Heroes: is a game that you grow into, the more you play, the more familiar you become with the Tiles and their combinations, it is a ever changing Sea, with new strategies and challenges in every game, enjoy and have fun.&#10;&#10;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players will need to push their luck, avoid frights, and keep their wits to get Ichabod safely home!&#10;&#10;In the game, one player will have 60 minutes (12 units of Time) to travel across 9 Woods cards in the Forest Row and reach the Covered Bridge. To do so, players will draw cards from the Journey Deck, typically placing them next to the deck to form the Fright Row. Woods cards that appear will have one of three good luck symbols on them. When there are two or more Woods cards in the Fright Row with a matching symbol, the player can spend one Time to take one of each matching Woods cards and place them into the Forest Row. The catch is that Woods cards cannot be placed in the Forest Row next to another Woods card that has the same good luck symbol.&#10;&#10;Fright cards may appear from the Journey Deck, as well. These three cards - a wolf, a bat, and an owl - are placed into the Fright Row. If at any time there is a matching pair of Fright cards in the Fright Row, the entire Fright Row is discarded. If there was a matching set of Woods cards in the Fright Row then the player loses no time. If not, the player loses one Time.&#10;&#10;If there are ever three different Fright cards in the Fright Row then the entire Fright Row is discarded and the player loses two Time.&#10;&#10;There are also several Event cards in the deck that, when drawn, trigger an effect and are discarded.

Select which color will be used for the entire game.&#10;&#10;3)  Shuffle the Twist Tiles and create a face-down draw pile.  Each team draws one tile.&#10;&#10;4)  Select which team will guess first and which player from that team will act first (the Actor).&#10;&#10;5)  Start the timer!&#10;&#10;6)  The Actor draws a card adn acts out the word or phrase.&#10;    Acting Rules:  &#10;    You cannot say words or make any sounds with your mouth.&#10;    You cannot mouth any words or write any letters in the air.&#10;&#10;7   The Actor's team shouts out guesses.  When a teammate guesses the card, the Actor draws another card and keeps going.&#10;&#10;8)  At the end of the turn, collect the cards that were correctly guessed and put them in a score pile for the team.  Any cards that were not guessed are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;9)  Now it's the other team's turn.  Continue taking turns, alternating teams, and selecting a different actor each time.&#10;&#10;Twist Tiles:  Mess With Your Opponents&#10;&#10;Correctly guess cards with a Twist icon to earn tiles that will sabotage the other team or give your team an advantage.&#10;&#10;1) At the start of a turn, the team that's not guessing may choose to play ONE of their Twist Tiles.  Then the guessing team may choose to play ONE of their Twist Tiles.&#10;&#10;2)  Read each played tile out loud and follow the rule written on it for the entire turn. (Rules affecting the Actor may be suspended in order to draw and read cards, but must be followed when acting out the card.)&#10;&#10;PASS ONE CARD:  These Twist Tiles do not need to be played at the start of the turn.  If the guessing team has one of these tiles, they may play it at any time in order to skip a card.&#10;&#10;3)  At the end of the turn, the guessing team draws one Twist Tile for each correctly guessed card with a Twist icon on it.&#10;&#10;4)  Review all of the Twist Tiles earned that turn.  Select ONE to keep and discard the rest.&#10;&#10;5)  Create a discard pile of any played or discarded Twist Tiles.  If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile.&#10;&#10;NOTE:  There is no limit to the number of Twist Tiles a team can have.&#10;&#10;THE BALL:  The Timer Doesn't End The Turn - You Do!&#10;When the timer runs out, any member of the throwing team (the team that is not guessing) may throw the ball at the Actor.&#10;&#10;- If the actor dodges the ball, they may continue acting out clues and scoring.

Whichever team has the most cards is the winner!&#10;&#10;Note:  If one team is larger, one member of the smaller team will be the Actor again, so both teams take the same number of turns.  Want a longer game?  Have everyone be the Actor two or three times before counting your score.&#10;&#10;DELINQUENTS:  At some point, someone is going to screw up.  Here's what to do...&#10;&#10;- If an acting rule or Twist Tile rule is broken, the card being acted is removed from the game and the guessing team cannot score it.  The Actor draws another card and continues their turn.&#10;&#10;- If a throwing rule is broken, the throw does not count.  The throwing team must throw again.&#10;&#10;- If the guessing team intercepts the ball or interferes with a throw, the turn immediately ends.&#10;&#10;"

A player may never possess more MP or SP than the maximum (6) listed on the track.&#10;&#10;1 Die is the Casting die and may be used to cast a spell as listed on player card. A player may cast a spell equal to the die value or exactly one value below die value and must pay the listed MP or SP to do so. Certain spells show a Resonance icon next to the die face. If the current location has a matching Resonance icon those spells cost 1 less MP or SP.&#10;&#10;You may not use a Power and Casting die on same turn. Only one of these dice will be placed on a corner as an active die.&#10;&#10;Both players then reveal their 3 placed dice.&#10;&#10;The player with the stronger Battle Number will place and/or move a cube on their respective track on the current Location card a number of spaces. This is calculated based on a nomograph table.&#10;&#10;Players only have 3 cubes so, with 7 Locations, they must decide where to deploy forces and which Locations to contest.&#10;&#10;Once a Location is won (when a player&rsquo;s cube moves to highest space on their track) that card will be slid towards the winner and they gain control over it. That Location will not be contested over again. The players take back their cubes from the card to their general supply. Location cards should be slid to fill in the gap left by the now controlled location.&#10;&#10;After each round, the losing player decides the next location to move the yellow cube to.&#10;&#10;Game End: &#10;Play continues until one player has gained control over 4 Locations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

When you make the right choice, the world moves in the right direction. The more I have more interest, the more transparent the politics. If we want a world where common sense is common, we must respect the importance of politics. And a small board game, Political World, that moves such a politicized book into a real sense of humor can make it easier and more fun for people to come into politics.&#10;&#10;Basic rules&#10;Polytical World is basically a marble type game that moves on a dice and can be played from a minimum of two to four (recommended). All players start as members of parliament. The board includes a total of 24 arcades including starting lines and TV discussions, including districts that reflect real politics.&#10;&#10;20% approval ratings in 5% increments will be substituted for currency and can be obtained using event cards and power cards. The approval rate certificate is held by the NEC, which replaces the bank, and when the NEC declines, it begins to take over and take away from other players. If you are in prison and lose your approval rate, you will be eliminated.&#10;The event card is the core of the game. It is a 72-card that combines the political and social issues of Korea with satire and humor. There is a variety of events and humor, including the approval rate certificate, loss, and imprisonment. The latest issue is updated every year for each edition.&#10;&#10;When the presidential election comes back every 12 months during the contest, the person with the highest approval rating is the president. The president has powerful power and gets the rest of the rest of the players.&#10;The victory condition is to win the president three times in succession, to become the president, to purge the remaining players, or to become the president and have a 100% approval rating.&#10;It may be strange at first, but once the game is started, you can find yourself embroidering a chopper to become a president and defeat another player. This is because, unlike the conventional possessive games, the three-dimensional and extraordinary feelings of power and dominance can be felt.&#10;The game continues until one last winner is left. There are a number of factors, including the rules outlined above, the remorse of the conscience, and the privilege of the president. Please feel it directly at the Polytical World 2016 edition.&#10;&#10;"
