There are 4 sets of 52 counters. Each player's set consists of 52 counters of the same color, numbering from 1 to 13 inclusive, 4 of each number. One player (the &quot;leader&quot;) turns their counters face down and mixes them up. All other players keep theirs face up and orderly, so they can find the numbers quickly and easily and see what numbers are left. The leader draws a counter and announces the number. All players take a counter of the same number from their set. They may play it to one of 4 columns or one of 4 stacks (foundations). Stacks are started with a 1 and go up sequentially to 13. If a number cannot be placed on a stack, it must be placed at the bottom end of one of the 4 columns. It is most desirable to place counters on columns so that the columns are in descending order. The only way to move a counter from a column is to move it onto one of the stacks. Only the counter at the bottom end of a column may be moved. Continue drawing until all counters have been placed. Your score is the sum of the numbers on the top of your stacks. Each player in turn takes the role of leader and reads off the numbers. Highest score after an agreed-upon number of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;"

There are also special cards marked 'upside down' that change the polarity of the cards in a players hand.&#10;&#10;On his or her turn a player takes the top card from the draw deck, banks one set of cards if possible, and then passes one card to the left.  'Upside down' cards may not be passed to another player.&#10;&#10;A set of three identical cards may be 'banked' during a players turn.  When one player has banked three sets of cards the round ends and the players score their hands.&#10;&#10;All banked cards, whether plus or minus, score plus the face value of the set.  For example three +10 cards score 10 points and three -6 cards score 6 points.  Three 'upside down' cards may be banked for a score of 0.&#10;&#10;All the cards in each players' hand are then added together to determine how many points are scored.  An 'Upside down' card in the players hand causes all + cards to become - and all - cards to become +.

When everyone has had a turn, the top box is removed from the tower and the remaining players attempt to pick their cards up from that level. If the card has been successfully picked up from the lowest level by more than one player, it is next placed on the floor.

Each piece begins with the full power of a King, moving diagonally forwards and backwards and jumping captures as in regular checkers.  Upon a first capture a piece is flipped over to the pawn-side with its movement then reduced to a backwards direction only.  A second capture of the same piece removes it from the game.  Winning is determined by getting your opponent into a position where s/he cannot make a legal move or the capture of all opponents pieces.&#10;&#10;"

The game covers the entire war from the Axis invasion of Russia to the final destruction of the Axis armies four years later.  The Axis  player has a fixed reinforcement rate, but the Russian player must decide what type of units he wants to produce by allocating his available resources.  These decisions are critical to the game as they were in the war.  There are also rules for supply, weather, air power and Axis Minor allies as well as variant campaign game rules.  In addition to the campaign game, there are four yearly scenarios, one for each year 1941-1944, which simulate the situation at key times during the campaign.  Those scenarios cover the Barbarossa Campaign, the Stalingrad Campaign, Kursk and the Destruction of Army Group Center.&#10;&#10;Reissued as War in the East: The Russo-German Conflict, 1941-45 (Second Edition) to form part of War in Europe.&#10;&#10;"

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.&#10;&#10;Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force. Well-armed with RPG's and mortars and backed by snipers, the defenders deployed small groups of hunter-killer teams to tackle any armor encountered. A battle for the city was set.&#10;&#10;Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players can brutally harm their opponent, while each has liabilities to protect.

At the start of the game, the cubes are randomly placed on the field, with the four corners left empty. From the instructions: A cube may jump only in the direction (or one of the directions) indicated on its upturned face. However, when the word &quot;Cubit&quot; appears on the upturned face, that cube may jump in any direction, except diagonally, which is never allowed.&#10;&#10;In the two-person game, each player removes as many cubes as possible as long as he can make a jump with the same cube.
