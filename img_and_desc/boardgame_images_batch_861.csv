What's not so magical is the intense planning that goes into making the annual event a success. This year, the fairies have turned to YOU, fair impresario extraordinaire, to bring together all the elements needed for the grand occasion. Fail, and you'll let down not only the fairies, but all the kids of the various assorted fantasy races who have been looking forward to this magical night all year long.&#10;&#10;Fairy Fair is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write game that takes place in the Legends of Dsyx fantasy setting.&#10;&#10;The player will roll dice to build various stalls and attractions inside a grid representing the fair grounds. Don't like what you've rolled? Roll again! Unlike in most roll-and-write games, players have UNLIMITED rerolls to make sure they get the fair just right. Unlimited, that is... until doubles come up, at which point the turn immediately ends without the chance to build anything at all. Sorry, but life isn't &quot;fair!&quot;&#10;&#10;Once the time track representing the approach of opening night is completely filled in, however, is when the games -- and game -- REALLY begins. Now, the player must guide the revelers along the choicest path through the fair, stopping at the various attractions to play carnival games, eat fanciful foods, and ride the many magical rides. Attractions alongside this path will flourish, while those that receive no foot traffic will need to close.&#10;&#10;Only those sights that remain open at the end of the fair will score points, and only by scoring high will the fairies even consider hiring you for the job again next year.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the September 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;"

You could almost mean &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot;. But far from it! In addition to a bit of luck in drawing cards, &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot; is especially about clever tactics. Otherwise you end up with an unintentionally high score. And as if that was not enough, then a drama lama or a karma lama can get in the way.&#10;&#10;Each player receives nine cards, which he disguises in a rectangle arranged in front of him. These are revealed during the course of the game and exchanged with cards from the stack. The goal is to have the lowest possible card values &#226;&#128;&#139;&#226;&#128;&#139;in your display at the end of a round. You can even achieve minus points by collecting three identical cards in a row or a column. A round ends as soon as a player has revealed all nine cards. Who then has the lowest score, wins the round and may grab a piece of wood in the form of a lama. The first to collect three Lama pieces, ie to win three rounds, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Of course, it's not that easy. The collection of triplets is very attractive, but at the same time quite risky. Because the trick here is: the higher the numbers of the cards are in a treble, the more minuses you get. However, if a teammate finished the round, before you could complete the treble, you sit on solid plus points. And you definitely do not want them in this game. So you better play it safe and only collect low cards or rather speculate on the highest possible triplet? Some players even come up with the idea to end the round intentionally fast, when his teammates are currently working on a treble with high cards to mess up their tour. For proper vortex care in between all the special cards. With the drama lama one buzzes additional points on a fellow player. With the Karma Lama on the other hand, you have to give away minus points. There the joy is great - for the others!&#10;&#10;So while you optimize your own display, you must constantly keep an eye on the players. Most importantly, you should avoid discarding a card that the next player can use for his triplets collection.&#10;&#10;"

Players will expand their minds by analyzing some realistic and  some not so realistic situations where one is forced to make a moral choice. Some choices may be easy while others may be much more difficult.  Players who engage honestly with an open mind may learn some things about their opponents as well as themselves as they challenge each other in a battle of strategic persuasion.&#10;&#10;For each round, one person plays the role of the hero while the others play as the tricksters. The hero is faced with a dilemma and must make a moral decision. The tricksters must make use of their cards and their creative mindset to attempt to alter the dilemma in such a way that will cause the hero to change their mind. Those tricksters who can change the hero&rsquo;s mind score a point for the round. The winner of Principle Dilemma is the one who scores the most points in a predetermined number of rounds, or is the first to score a predetermined number of points.&#10;&#10;This party game for thinkers can be played seriously or just for fun. Either way, it shatters the ice in a meaningful way by providing a stage for authentic and exciting conversation between friends and strangers alike. When the stakes are lifted and the variations eccentric, there is freedom to explore outside the box.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
