358696,,"Pangaex is a world-conquering game with aspects of Risk, Catan, and Terraforming Mars. The game is played on a modular board (81 2&quot;-square tiles), each of which indicates one of the following resources: Culture, Food, Weapons, Commerce, Mountains, or Lakes. Each player starts with a Capital game piece and two village game pieces, which are placed in a snake-draft system. Each player also begins with some resources and a soldier, who begins the game on the Capital tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in two repeating phases: Production phase (collecting resources based on villages and/or soldiers in play), and Action phase. The Production phase happens simultaneously, where all players collect resources at the same time. The Action phase is where the bulk of the game is played. Players can move their soldiers; they can also use resources to build villages, train soldiers, and even convert enemy villages to their own culture. Like Terraforming Mars, each player may take up to two actions on their turn--however, a pass is not a pass for the whole Action phase, but merely a pass on a given turn. The Action phase ends when all players have passed consecutively.&#10;&#10;Soldiers are more than just soldiers in Pangaex. Soldiers raze enemy villages, but they also help to rebuild their own villages. They prevent peaceful cultural conversion, and they even collect resources at times.&#10;&#10;When any player plays their final village, the game ends after the Action phase concludes (i.e. final village signifies final round, not final play). Points are awarded for villages on the board, enemy villages that you've collected (by razing or converting), and other metrics to balance out the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Players flick their monsters onto Satan's castle, trying to earn enough reward to gather three 'heroes'. The first player to recruit three heroes, such as Dracula, Succubus, Vorpal Bunny, or Hanako in the toilet, is the winner.&#10;&#10;One player acts as Satan and defends a large castle, made from staggered boxes as a dias, with a throne at the top. The other players have a Demon King, one of eight such as Lucifer, Cthulhu, or Nurarihyon. Each Demon King starts with special abilities to help the player.&#10;&#10;The game uses highly decorated plastic cards. The player takes their plastic Demon King card and inserts it vertical into a base card. This creates a flicking device. By holding the base down, and bending the card back, a player can flick their small foam creatures up onto the castle levels. Satan can defend the castle platform with its own cards, or use whatever toys or plushies a player has to hand.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the attackers try to steal money from the castle, and use this to recruit 'heroes' to their side. These heroes bring more powers and abilities to the cause, and strengthen the attack in different ways. For example, the Vorpal Bunny increases the attack magnification to the throne by 100 times and exerts super high firepower, but Hanako in the toilet nullifies the attack on the throne. Getting Hanako-san from the toilet keeps the player with Vorpal Bunny in check. Players can choose to work together, and a player might even be better off attacking themselves. The game system is very open and fluid in the way the characters' abilities work.&#10;&#10;The first player to gain three heroes to their side is the winner.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

In other words, the front side of the piece expresses the ability as a unit, but when it is damaged and becomes the back side, it expresses the ability of the individual military commander. In terms of wargames, the front side is the operational level and the back side is the tactical level. If the soldiers are lost due to damage, the military commander will fight directly.&#10;There is also a twist on the victory conditions.

358960,,"Winds of Caribbean is a naval battle-themed game of sailing ships during the Age of Discovery, based on the system of the masterpiece Wings of War: Dawn of War. Players control sailboats, shoot cannons, and sometimes come alongside to fight and aim for victory.&#10;The big difference between Wings of War and Winds of Caribbean is that the former has the same direction of movement and attack, while the later has different directions of movement and attack. The theory of naval battles during the age of sail was to face the enemy on the side where the cannons were lined up, and this game also reproduced that. You can experience a different battle from the air battle, such as how to switch between movement and attack. In addition, the cannon reflects the performance of the time, it requires loading of bullets for each attack and the rapid fire does not work, and if the ship moves violently, the hit rate will drop or it will not be possible to load. It also includes the element that if a fire breaks out due to being hit, the fire must be extinguished. When ships collide with each other, side-to-side battle (aboldage) also occurs. Some ships are better at this, so pirate style is also possible.&#10;The feature of the component is that the display such as loading of bullets and decrease of hit rate is set to &quot;character + lines&quot;. It is also an expression that the commander's ability and command occupy a large weight in the naval battle at that time.&#10;There are three types of ships: caravel, carrack, and small galleon.&#10;&#10;"
