He also receives a pawn of his color and a tent of his color.&#10;During the game, each player can find cards that help them improve their skills or increase their lives.&#10;The forest is represented by 73 tiles that are initially face down in the center of the table, we will turn them when we go exploring them, and a river that we must cross to go to the different zones of the forest.&#10;During the turn of each player can choose between three actions:&#10;&#10;-Explore the jungle; He moves his pawn to an adjacent tile, and turns it face-up. Once you have seen the type of tile, you must steal a card from the corresponding deck and solve it with a dice roll, which depends on the skill you have.&#10;&#10;-Recover territory explored; You can move your pawn by adjacent tiles from one to three, as long as they are scanned.&#10;&#10;-Getting a camp; If your pawn has been placed in an abandoned camp tile, you can place your camp there by placing the tent of your color on this tile.

Una vez visto el tipo de loseta, debe robar una carta del mazo correspondiente y resolverla mediante una tirada de dados, que depende de la habilidad que posea.&#10;&#10;-Recorrer territorio explorado; Puedes desplazar tu pe&oacute;n por losetas adyacentes de una a tres, siempre y cuando est&eacute;n exploradas.&#10;&#10;-Colocar un campamento; si tu pe&oacute;n se haya situado en una loseta de campamento abandonado, puedes situar all&iacute; tu campamento situando sobre esta loseta la tienda de campa&ntilde;a de tu color. Puedes cambiar la ubicaci&oacute;n de tu campamento tantas veces como quieras durante toda la partida. (Esto te ayuda cuando contraes una enfermedad de la selva, ya que deber&aacute;s ir a este campamento a recibir el tratamiento y poder seguir jugando)&#10;&#10;El objetivo del juego es ser el explorador con m&aacute;s oro en su poder cuando la partida termine. El final de la partida, se produce inmediatamente cuando alg&uacute;n explorador encuentra la m&iacute;tica ciudad del Eldorado, el jugador que la encuentre recibir&aacute; una bonificaci&oacute;n de 10 monedas de oro.&#10;Tambi&eacute;n recibir&aacute; una bonificaci&oacute;n de 4 monedas de oro, el explorador que m&aacute;s maldiciones haya superado.&#10;&#10;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;Pero cuidado, si un jugador est&aacute; maldito cuando la partida acab&eacute;, no podr&aacute; ser ganador aunque sea el que m&aacute;s dinero haya conseguido!!!

An Allied force made up of French, British, and Turks had laid siege to the major naval port of Sevastopol.  Desperate to lift the siege, their Russian enemies probed the allied line for a weak spot. They found it on Mount Inkerman, held by less than 7,000 British. On October 27, the Russians initiated a brief skirmish to test the British defenses (later called &quot;Little Inkerman&quot;). On November 5, they were ready to crush them with over 35,000 Russians.&#10;&#10;It did not go quite as planned. The disorganized Russians had their forces divided in two parts, under the command of three generals, each of whom had a different, contradictory, battle plan. A cold and dense fog allowed the Russians to get the drop on their enemies, but visibility was so poor that there was little command structure in place for either side. Regiments and companies had no choice but to fight (or flee) on their own initiative, giving Inkerman the nickname &quot;the Soldier's Battle&quot;.&#10;&#10;While the fog reduced the range of the Allied Mini&eacute; rifle, it was far more accurate and deadly than the Russian muskets, especially at point-blank range. The Russians relied on ferocious but bloody bayonet charges to make up the difference. But as Russian morale started to flag, the fog began to lift, and nearly 9,000 Allied reinforcements arrived-- particularly the fearsome French Zouaves-- the battle turned in the Allied favor. In the end, there were 4,676 Allied killed and wounded, and over 10,000 Russian.&#10;&#10;The game uses a unique variant on chit-pull activation mechanisms, with each player alternating pulling from their own pool. The number of activations per turn is tied to the current Fog level. At the start of the game, it's somewhat difficult for the Fog to rise, but once it starts to do so, it happens rapidly. Russian morale is simulated via its own chit-pull pool, and like the Fog, it begins the game in solid shape but once it starts to flag, it quickly collapses. In this way, the odds start to shift to favor the Allied Player. Generally speaking, the Russian Player is strong in the early game and his opponent in the late game.&#10;&#10;Step-losses and the gradual erosion of fighting strength is modeled using the &quot;stack of steps&quot; mechanic featured in some earlier Tom Russell designs, such as 2012's Blood on the Alma. The game is Regimental in scale, with each hex representing roughly one-tenth of a kilometer.&#10;&#10;"

Roberts Award-winning game Downtown. Red Storm is a standalone game that utilizes the Downtown game system to depict a hypothetical air war in May/June 1987 over the central portion of the NATO/Warsaw Pact front in central Germany.  Like Downtown and Elusive Victory before it, Red Storm is an &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level air warfare game where players manage large strike packages and numerous combat air patrols in an effort to strike enemy targets, protect their own ground troops, and secure control of the air over the land battle raging below.  Both sides have highly advanced all-weather aircraft, long-range missiles, precision bombs, sophisticated electronic warfare assets, and dense air defense networks of surface-to-air missiles and radar-guided AAA.  The game features aircraft from the United States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Soviet Union, and East Germany.&#10;&#10;As the NATO player, you fight outnumbered in the air, but with a qualitative edge in technology and better-trained pilots.  NATO faces the daunting task of contesting the air in the face of the initial onslaught from the WP air forces while also getting bombs onto targets on the ground both on the frontline and rear echelon forces of the Soviet and East German armies.  As the Warsaw Pact player,  you must push your numerous but less flexible forces to the absolute limit in an effort to overwhelm NATO forces in the air and destroy them on the ground, all while supporting advancing ground forces.  Both players also have to manage their air defense networks consisting of overlapping layers of SAM and AAA.&#10;&#10;Units&#10;Like earlier games in the series, units in Red Storm are flights of 1 to 4 aircraft, each tasked with different roles such as bombing, combat air patrol, close escort, or jamming support.  Red Storm features more than 50 types of aircraft, including both older &ldquo;3rd Generation&rdquo; workhorses like the F-4E Phantom II and MiG-23 Flogger as well as advanced &ldquo;4th Generation&rdquo; fighters including the US F-15 Eagle, the UK/West German Tornado, and the Soviet MiG-29 Fulcrum. Aircraft from the air forces of Belgium, West Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and East Germany are provided.  Ground units depict various types of troop concentrations, SAMs, and AAA assets.  The SAM network on both sides is both more numerous and more dangerous than ever, with low-altitude SAMs like the UK Rapier, US Chaparral, and Soviet SA-13 Gopher joining a daunting array of medium/high altitude SAMs like the US Patriot and Soviet SA-12.&#10;&#10;Maps and Terrain&#10;Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map sheets depict the rough terrain in the central portion of the NATO front line, reaching from the Rhine river in the west to the Thuringia region of southwest East Germany.  The map uses the same scale of approximately 2.5 nautical miles per hex used in earlier games in the series.  This densely populated region of Europe features numerous rivers, cities, and airfields dot the map.  Unlike earlier games in the series, Red Storm features a frontline that moves steadily west as the Warsaw Pact armies advance.&#10;&#10;Game System&#10;Like the earlier games in the series, Red Storm requires both players to do planning for both their air and ground forces prior to a scenario.  Raid forces must be generated, targets and routes planned, and aircraft loadouts determined.  SAM, AAA, and radar units must be placed to take advantage of the rough terrain and frequently poor weather of central Germany.&#10;&#10;During a scenario, players go through a sequence of phases each turn where they conduct electronic warfare, use various means to detect and track enemy flights, and move and fight with their flights while potentially being attacked from the ground.  The heart of game is the movement phase where players use a chit-draw system that allows players to alternate moving one to five flights at a time.&#10;&#10;Scenarios&#10;The war depicted in Red Storm is a short one, with just six weeks between the start of the air war and a fateful initiation of nuclear warfare by both sides.  More than 20 scenarios feature a mix of day and night operational missions for both sides, including missions to directly support frontline ground troops as well as many missions that &ldquo;go deep&rdquo; behind enemy lines to strike enemy airfields, logistics, and air defense networks.  These range in size from smaller, partial-map ones that can be played in an afternoon to very large, full-map scenarios that might take a couple of days to complete.  There are also scenarios depicting reconnaissance missions, airborne drops, helicopter assaults, special forces insertions, cruise missile strikes, and delivery of nuclear weapons.&#10;&#10;Components&#10;Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; maps&#10;1,260 die cut counters&#10;One Rules Booklet&#10;One Scenario Booklet&#10;One Appendices Booklet&#10;Five Full-Color Player Aid Cards&#10;Three Full-Color Aircraft Data Cards&#10;Two 10-sided dice&#10;NATO and Warsaw Pact log sheets&#10;&#10;"
