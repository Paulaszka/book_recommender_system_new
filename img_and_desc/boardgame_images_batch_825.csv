In 1795, Kamehameha unified the big island of Hawaii and set out to bring the other islands under one high king.&#10;&#10;This is a two-player game of Kamehameha&rsquo;s campaign of unification. One player controls the forces of Kamehameha, the other commands the allied chiefs of Oahu and Maui.

Counters represent warriors, musketeers, pikemen, elite guards, cannons, and canoes.&#10;&#10;The game mechanics are based on the Ancient Wars system. Cards generate special events, such as intervention by the forces of Kauai, the acquisition of cannons from European powers, or granting one player tactical advantages or additional forces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

When the game starts, depending on the number of players, a number of landmarks are drawn from the landmark deck and placed on the board as places for the players to travel to and collect. Once a landmark is collected by a player, however, the other players cannot collect that same landmark and a new landmark is drawn from the deck and placed on the map.&#10;&#10;During a turn, players must choose to collect resources, travel, or use a free ride card. When collecting resources, they may choose any one of the available tickets (bus, rail, high-speed rail, or airline) or all of the cash currently face up in the resource pool, called the panhandle. New cards from the resource deck replace those that were taken. To travel, a player spends the required resource cards from their hand to move from one city to another city, matching resource cards to the method of travel required. Some cities are connected to one another by rail or road, others by high-speed rail, etc. Cash allows a player to buy any of the various means of travel. On a free ride turn, the player gets to utilize a rail or bus connection for free (without spending any resource cards from hand) by using a free ride card that is available in the panhandle.&#10;&#10;Landmarks have three traits: Type (entertainment, natural, historical), region (Alaska, Hawaii, Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, Southeast) and alignment (represented by a number: 1-100). In order to win, a player must be the first to collect any one of the following sets: Any 8 landmarks; 2 of each type of landmark; 5 landmarks from different regions; or any 3 landmarks that have a matching alignment number (only the last digit of the number is used to determine).&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

They cover fascinating, almost forgotten conflicts that would guide the course of World War II in the Mediterranean Theater and East Africa.&#10;&#10;Forgotten Legions is yet another Classic Reborn! by Compass Games.&#10;&#10;Drive on Damascus gives you an Operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (June and July) 1941 Allied invasion of Vichy French held Syria and Lebanon. Here you can hone your game play skills with open maneuvering on the desert side of the map and tough in-fighting on the mountain side. A fluid situation can develop as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. And along the coast players will probe for vulnerabilities by maneuver and infiltration. An exhaustive Order of Battle based on archival records helps capture key historical facets of the campaign including armor advantage, air power, ranged artillery, flotillas and commandos, garrisons, mountain units, untried units, and more. Also examined is the possibility of a German intervention&#10;&#10;Bloody Keren presents an Operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (January through April) 1941 campaign in Italian Eritrea that historically saw a climax at the mountain pass at Keren. Here too, good game play is at a premium as strategically you allocate your forces to various mountain passes. Both sides can attack and counter-attack while guerilla forces attempt to close off reinforcements coming from the south.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the 1981 and 1983 releases by World Wide Wargames (3W) that honor the original game designs. All aspects of the games have been enhanced &ndash; rules, charts and tables, map, counters &ndash; based on years of player experience and feedback. The rules are common to both games and are short and well illustrated, along with extensive Design Notes. Each game has a short scenario in addition to the Campaign scenario. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, each Campaign scenario can allow for up to four players (two per side). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage and celebrating the original classic designs by Vance von Borries. For your gaming enjoyment, this game has been super-sized by featuring a larger playing surface (two maps) and the larger 5/8&rdquo; counters to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;"

A piece can be a single man or a mono-colored stack and moves as far as it is high in a straight line in one of the six main directions. Pieces may merge or split and they capture opponent's pieces by replacement, regardless of size, removing the opponent's piece.&#10;&#10;The actions of both players inherently lead to a division of the board in a number of territories, separated by a contiguous Wall.

Tix can be earned by travelling to different continents, using different vehicles and by observing the Moon, the planets (expansion) and the constellations of stars. In the endgame the Tix are essential to overcome the obstacles to the Moon. The first player reaching the Moon with sufficient Tix covering those difficulties during the trip wins the game. When playing solo, a time restriction is added to win the game depending on the difficulty level.&#10;&#10;OVERVIEW MECHANICS&#10;The game board shows in the top left corner that each round, called a month, consists of three phases:&#10;&#10;     Ecliptic phase: when the new first player shifts the Sun on the star map, lays out new observation cards in the observation area and initiates the first choice of the planning phase.&#10;     Planning phase: each player in counter clockwise order, starting with the first player, chooses a vacant lunar phase (1 of the 4 weeks in a month) to plan an action by placing his meeple accordingly.&#10;     Activation phase: Beginning with the first week (new moon), the planned actions are being executed. In a game with more than 4 players the direct observation takes precedent of travelling, then saving an observation card, ending with observing a saved observation card.&#10;&#10;&#10;The star map shows the Sun with new background stars, forming a zodiac constellation, each month of the year. A day light card will cover the constellations present during the day. This dynamic alters the visibility in horizontal fashion, according what astronomers call Right Ascension (RA). The sunset and sunrise drawn on the daylight card forms the observer&rsquo;s western and eastern horizon.&#10;A map of planet Earth shows the continents you can travel to and can result in a visibility change as an observer according to the latitude change after each movement. The latitude correlates with the highest passing of the stars overhead; called zenith. The visibility in vertical fashion is expressed in what astronomers call Declination (DEC).  Blocks underneath an armillary sphere will indicate your northern and southern horizon.&#10;The observation area contains a freshly laid out combination of observation cards that can be scored when visible according to the time of the year and the place the player is on Earth. The lunar phases are scored according to the right week of the month that they appear in.&#10;The end game unfolds once a player reaches the launch pad for a voyage to the Moon. Once launched the player must tackle certain difficulties (Diff) by keeping the Diff values under their acquired knowledge and observation points (Tix). Special abilities, hidden agendas and lunar phase abilities can mitigate the values to be absorbed by your knowledge as a navigator.&#10;The game invokes an elegant choice between efficient observation, puzzling travel routes, playing out opportunities with abilities and some courage to risk a rocket launch as soon as possible.&#10;&#10;WHAT'S UNIQUE?&#10;LunaTix: Star Trackers offers a highly educational chance to get in touch with a real star map and to learn its link with our location on Earth. The knowledge of our planet&rsquo;s position and movement around the Sun, forming our seasons in time and climate regions in latitude, will provide you with a deeper insight on how people came to divide time and space as we know it.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

However, some boards have more or less pits.  Each side of the board belongs to one player.  Boards are usually made of wood and carved into different designs.  The seeds are cowrie shells, though other items can be used.&#10;&#10;The game is played similar to Mancala with some notable differences.  The goal of the game is to obtain the most seeds. The game starts off with seven seeds in each pit. Players get seeds by placing seeds into their storehouse.  Players take the first turn simultaneously.  During a player's turn, a player picks up pieces on their side of the board and drops a seed in each pit clockwise, placing a seed in their storehouse, but skipping the opponent's storehouse.  If a player drops the final seed in a pit with seeds, the player picks up the seeds in the pit and continues their turn, distributing the picked up seeds in another lap.  If a player drops the final seed in an empty pit on their side of the board, they capture all the seeds in the corresponding pit on the opponent's side of the board (as well as the seed they placed in an empty pit).  A player's turn ends when a seed lands in an empty pit regardless of which side it lands.  Play proceeds until all the seeds on one side of the board are empty.  If there are still seeds on a side of the board, the player who owns the side gets all those sides.&#10;&#10;Games can also be played in rounds.  At the end of a round, each player fills up each pit on their side with the seeds they had in their storehouse; each pit gets seven seeds as in setup.  Leftover seeds remain in their storehouse.  If there are not enough seeds to fill a pit, the pit gets burned and removed from play.  Players cannot put seeds into the burned pit.  The series of rounds can be finished when a player can no longer sufficiently fill one pit with seven seeds.&#10;&#10;"

To play, you say the word &quot;dude&quot; as you think it should be said, based on how it appears on your card. At the same time, listen to how the other players are saying the word &quot;dude&quot;. Trying to figure out whether you have the same card as another player is the essence of dude.&#10;&#10;"

Similar to Cards Against Humanity in comedy style, in GoO you play a troll on the internet trying to prove you&rsquo;re the most oppressed snowflake of them all. You are a troll though so your complaints aren&rsquo;t about real issues but things you&rsquo;ve made up in your mind. Your friends, evil trolls that they are, are also trying to prove they&rsquo;re actually the most oppressed and stop you from gaining the win. Most importantly though the Game of Oppression: Poe&rsquo;s Law is about inclusive gaming. Almost everyone will find an image of themselves somewhere in the deck.&#10;&#10;The goal of GoO is to gain the most Oppression Points (OP) and/or to be crowned King of the Snowflakes. Game play is simple turn-based competitive point grab. There are three to five rounds per game depending on the number of players. Each game is approximately 30-90 minutes in length.  During your turn you&rsquo;re allowed to play up to three Cards of Complaint (CoC) worth between 3-5 OP. Additionally, you may play up to one Special card per round. All CoCBlocks are worth -3 OP and one may be played per Card of Complain. Every CoCBlock though can be countered with a DoubleDown worth a single point. Any item on the table not in the SafeSpace may be stolen through judicious use of the special Yoink card. After each round all players draw up to the hand limit of five so you&rsquo;re never low on ways to prove how &ldquo;abused&rdquo; you are by the world.&#10;&#10;Storytelling is an important element of the inclusive comedy of GoO. After playing a Card of Complaint you explain your story that goes along with the card. The story is built upon via blocking and then finished via DoublingDown. Each CoC can contain one tiny snippet of story for the group to discuss and share. While you do not have to include storytelling to play the game one of the main goals of the Game of Oppression is to share with your fellow trolls. Prove you&rsquo;re the most oppressed troll ever to gain the crown.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

In turns, players place their pieces and two walls on their side of the field.
