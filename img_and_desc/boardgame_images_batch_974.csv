(eg, attacking an opponent's island can give you the edge you need to win, but also often causes reprisals and limits the treasure you earn from Black Cards)&#10;&#10;Game actions during your turn include: placing cards (for Treasure Points), rearranging cards (to and from your island and hand), and playing pirate cards (to attack opponents or give yourself advantages).&#10;&#10;When it is not your turn, you have the opportunity to BLOCK incoming pirate attacks if you have the right matching Color Card in your hand.

Archaeological evidence reveal their culture going back at least 2,500 years. Remnants of the ancient city of Monte Alb&aacute;n in the form of buildings, ball courts, magnificent tombs, and finely worked gold jewelry testify of this once great civilization. Monte Alb&aacute;n was one of the first major cities in Mesoamerica and the center of the Zapotec state that dominated much of the territory that today belongs to the Mexican state of Oaxaca.&#10;&#10;In a game of Zapotec, you build temples, cornfields and villages in the three valleys surrounding the capital to generate resources needed for building pyramids, making sacrifices to the gods, and performing rituals.&#10;&#10;Each round, players simultaneously pick a card from their hand to determine their turn order and the resources they collect. Players then perform individual turns and spend resources to build new houses, gain access to special abilities, make sacrifices to the gods and build pyramids. The played action card determines three important aspects of each player's turn:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The resource printed at the top of the card determines the row or column to activate on the resource grid to collect income.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The icon in the middle of the card matches one of the nine properties of the building spaces on the map (one of three building types, one of three regions, or one of three terrain types). On their turn, players may build only on spaces that match that icon.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    The number at the bottom of the card dictates the turn order for the round when the card is played.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, players draft new cards from the central offer, with the final undrafted card becoming the scoring bonus card for the following round.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, players score points for pyramids, for their position on the sacrifice track, and for their ritual cards.

The yellow nine is replaced by the Sun, which is a special card that can double winnings if played by the winner to &ldquo;Go out with the Sun&rdquo;, but doubles the penalty if still held in the hand at the end of a round.&#10;&#10;An ante is paid into the winner&rsquo;s pool by each player at the start of each round, and the dealer also pays into a separate pool for each phase of the moon, and double for the Sun. The top card is turned over each round to select the winning colour for the round, and any player that plays a moon card in the matching colour gets the contents of the matching moon pool. The Sun pool is only emptied when a player goes &ldquo;Out with the Sun&rdquo;, when they also get all winnings from all other coins as well.&#10;&#10;"

Or an otter won?&#10;&#10;An Otter Won' is a spiritual sequel to Why I Otter, taking everything up a notch (including the ridiculous otters). Here's a short description from Aaron:&#10;&#10;It's still trick-taker-like. Works sort of in the opposite manner than Why I Otter. In Why I Otter you score your tricks from public conditions. In An Otter Won you have personal conditions in the cards you've taken into your den that play off public otter cards in the river. It's a bit more thinky/gamerly. It also does away with rock/paper/scissors. It uses a neutral setup card per trick that may help determine if the high or the low card wins the round. The winner assigns those 3 cards (neutral yours and opponents) to which goes to which location. Opponent den, your den and the river.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the July 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.&#10;&#10;"

Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (which affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley. Each card also lists a hazard: heat, terrain, flood or animals. Having three of the same hazard visible in their tableau causes the player to bust and lose all the progress in their journey.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players sum the stars in their journey and any additional points from card abilities to determine who wins.&#10;&#10;Death Valley was a top-three finalist in Button Shy's 18-Card Challenge: Design a game about a real life location.&#10;&#10;"
