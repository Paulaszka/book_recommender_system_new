After a brief period of confusion, three factions began to emerge to fill the vacuum left by Caesar&rsquo;s death.  The Tyrannicides led by Marcus Junius Brutus and assisted by Gaius Cassius Longinus left Rome and took provinces in the East to govern, there to bide their time, gather strength, and hopefully complete the restoration of the Republic.  A second faction under Marcus Antonius, Senior Consul and Caesar&rsquo;s chief lieutenant, and supported by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, initially attempted to come to an accommodation with the Tyrannicides with the intent securing a power-base in Cisalpine Gaul and subsequently to seize control in Rome.  The third faction under Gaius Octavius, Caesar&rsquo;s nephew and adopted son, was intent upon claiming his inheritance and assuming the position that was Caesar&rsquo;s in the state.  Initially making common cause with Decimus Brutus (a tyrannicide) and the Senate, he attempted to check Antony&rsquo;s ambitions whilst pursuing a dual agenda of avenging Caesar and assuming primacy in the state.  By 30BC, Octavius (later Augustus Caesar) had eliminated all competition and become the undisputed Leader of Rome.&#10;&#10;Ides of March is a three-player simulation representing the end of the Roman Republic, with each faction vying for control of the state through both political and military means.  As the Leader of one of the three major factions, you control the Leaders, forces, and political resources of your faction in a struggle to win personal control of the machinery of state and thus become &ldquo;Princeps&rdquo;, or undeclared Emperor of the Roman World.  Rules to play the game with two-players are found at the end of this rulebook.&#10;&#10;A shorter Rubicon Module simulates the earlier struggle between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great who was backed by the Senate that ultimately led to Caesar&rsquo;s victory and assumption of the position of Dictator-for-Life.

Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &quot;Train robbing.&quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.&#10;&#10;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins.&#10;&#10;"

It is a game of route building, deliveries and gift giving.  The challenge of the game is. How to get ahead when the primary method of gaining points is by improving other player's positions?&#10;&#10;'Ohana Proa was developed publicly via a blog on BGDF.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;IntroductionThe societies of the South Pacific were characterized by gift economies in which wealth and status were defined by what was given to others rather than personal accumulation. In Ohana Proa players will compete for prestige via gift-giving and thus improving the other player's positions.&#10;&#10;During the course of the game players will explore and claim routes among the islands. The number of routes a player may explore and claim each turn is limited by the number of explorers the player has (maximum 2).&#10;&#10;Players will also join markets among the islands by moving them along 'claimed routes and in doing so attempt to gather them into groups. A group of three, four or five markets (player choice) is &quot;satisfied&quot; and is removed from the game. The number of routes that a player may move a market over during a delivery is limited by the player's proas (boats, maximum 7).&#10;&#10;By delivering markets through islands where they have network presence players will receive fish or shells. Fish and shells may be used to gain an additional explorer, to acquire more proas or kahunas, to bid for turn order, to claim explored routes and to make and enhance kula items. Kula items are gifts that may be given to other players in order to gain prestige (but give the recipient points).&#10;&#10;Fish rot quickly and are lost if not spent quickly enough. Shells rot more slowly and kula items decay. Kula items can be enhanced with fish or shells to increase their value when given.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all of one colour of market has been delivered, a player reaches 33 prestige or the players reach deadlock. The player(s) with the lowest prestige score are eliminated from the game and do not score. The remaining players receive additional points for their prestige scores. The highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Ohana Proa supports 3 through 5 players, is particularly recommended for 4 players and plays in around 150 minutes.&#10;&#10;"
