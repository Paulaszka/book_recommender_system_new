When he goes to walk home, he finds himself in a hallucinated alcoholic wonderland!  &#10;     The objective in this game is to be the first one to get Squirrel home. Sounds easy enough, but the twisted trail loaded with booby traps and treasures, along with the drinking challenge, creates a great board game for all drinking game fans.&#10;     First pick a starter. The game comes with some creative ideas for this. Then everybody rolls one dice and moves along the trail accordingly. The trail is filled with short cuts filled with Jail spots. When a player lands in Jail, they must finish their drink before returning to gameplay. On the main yellow trail, players are likely to land on the Golden Acorns. Landing here means the player gets bonus turns by guessing high, low, odd, or even, based on their previous roll, and they keep going untill they guess wrong. Simply follow the yellow trail and everybody will make it to the finish, but the twisted trail makes this an interesting tricky challenge. Luckily the game comes with a map that will show you the way. The game also comes with sober cab rules so everybody can play. If you are a power hour fan, you will definately like the drinking challenge built into this game. The challenge is that every time you land on a &quot;D&quot; Spot, you must take the number of drinks that you rolled to get there. Over all, This is a unique and simple drinking board game that anyone over 21 can easily learn, and start the challenge of being the first player to get Squirrel home alive.&#10;&#10;"

Each side allows the player to perform differnt actions on. But, the player is limited to eight pieces, and the pieces used to roll, are also the pieces used as units on the gameboard. So players are forced to try and strike a balance between units in their hand powering units on the board, and units on the board actually fighting the conflict.&#10;  A player wins by either, eliminating all the opponents offensive units, or by postioning his own offensive units in an unbreakable defensive postion.&#10;&#10;"

The player who thinks the image is on his/her own player board calls out. The tile is placed face up next to the player board. If two players call out simultaneously, the game master puts the tile at the bottom of his/her stack. If an image isn't claimed by any of the players, the tile is removed from the game.

138839,,"This is definitely one of those games where the name directed the mechanic. The concept of karma &ndash; good and bad, owing or being owed a debt, and both being a responsibility &ndash; and a meta game element of card destruction (making every deck unique) and Real World &trade; consequences (in the form of a verbal contract to play) sort of came after the pun of Karma and Armageddon.&#10;&#10;The most important part of this game concept is that players may &ldquo;help&rdquo; you, even when you don&rsquo;t want it, and that this will exact a real consequence to clear the debt. Of course, like a gambling debt, this isn&rsquo;t enforceable. However, entering into the spirit of the thing is the whole point. Why cheat? You&rsquo;re only robbing yourself&hellip;&#10;&#10;Set up&#10;There are two elements to this game:&#10;&#10;1) A card game played with (what starts out at least as) a standard deck of cards. If there are Jokers, bridge rules or instruction cards, include them.&#10;&#10;2) Redemption of Debt where cards used to help other players are IOUs for an hour of a player&rsquo;s time on any reasonable, legal and responsible task.&#10;&#10;To play (the first time) a Sharpie or permanent marker and a standard deck of cards (with jokers) is necessary for 2-4 players. For more than 4 players an extra deck of cards is added for each additional player up to 8 maximum; ideally this should have a different back design or be different size to allow separation for future 2-4 player games. These cards will be torn, ripped and marked, so will likely not be useful for other games afterwards.&#10;&#10;NOTE: a deck where cards are missing (otherwise useless!) is fine as a starting deck. Subsequent play will likely not have all the cards anyway, so one or two missing now won&rsquo;t matter. Reuse/Recycling!!! I feel better already!&#10;&#10;Set up for the Meta-Game (the redemption of favours) is merely the agreement of all players that they will commit to an hour of time helping one another for each &ldquo;Debt Card&rdquo; they end up with. Where this occurs in game, the card will be ripped in two and both parts signed by helper and helpee; its recommended that a phone number or email address for each is also written down, unless players are well acquainted. The helpee then uses their half in play (for that game only) and later as a reminder that they owe a favour. The helper keeps their half to call in the debt.&#10;&#10;NOTE: The hour of time and the task are to be mutually agreed between helper and helpee. It could be anything crom mowing a lawn, babysitting, fixing a computer, whatever is acceptable and doable.&#10;&#10;NOTE 2: Debts do NOT cancel out. If Mike owes Paco a debt and vice versa, they don&rsquo;t call it quits. They both do an hour for the other. This is a matter of honour!&#10;&#10;Once a debt is paid, &ldquo;Done&rdquo; is written on the helpers half and &ldquo;Paid&rdquo; is written on the helpees half. Cards can be kept as a memento, burned ceremoniously or binned.&#10;&#10;"

Thanks to the support of wealthy Archons, the kingdom gets rebuilt so that Science and Arts can flourish once again. At the same time new soldiers are recruited and the army prepares for the inevitable moment when the kingdom will need to be defended once again.&#10;&#10;In Archon: Glory &amp; Machination, players are powerful Archons who support Cardis in order to win King's favor.

For each of these Seasons, the King issues different demands that players must fulfill in order to score Victory Points. Each season consists of 3 rounds during which players use a card-driven worker placement mechanism to perform various actions that will allow them to gather resources and income, recruit soldiers and, rebuild the city, and acquire scoring cards (Science &amp; Arts). They will also have the chance to train Elite Warriors to assist in the city's defense. After nine rounds, the game ends and the player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;"

The storyteller position then rotates in clockwise order, and the next player begins their turn, continuing the story.&#10;&#10;Each turn brings the game closer to conclusion.

As each narrator finishes their turn, the rest of the players draw a cube from a common pool and place it on one of the four tableaus.

When a batsman is out, the next batsman in takes the colour just vacated.&#10;One counter is used for batting and one for bowling. These are placed on the squares marked &ldquo;Start&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;To start play, the bowler throws the dice and moves his counter forward the number of spaces indicated by the throw.

He does this by throwing the dice and moving forward the number of squares on the batting chart thus indicated. The number of runs shown on the square is credited to the batsman on whose colour the counter is lying after the move is completed.&#10;&#10;If the bowling counter falls on a wicket-taking square, the batsman who is out is the one whose coloured square is occupied by the batting counter. After taking a wicket the bowler bowls again before the batsman can make a stroke. Should the bowling counter fall on a square marked &ldquo;extras&rdquo;, these runs are credited to the batting side, but the batsmen make no stroke, and therefore the bowler must play again.&#10;&#10;Batsmen cannot be out when lying on the square marked &ldquo;Start&rdquo;. It is a simple matter to work out the averages of all the different batsmen, and if bowling averages are also wanted, six throws of the dice would constitute an &ldquo;over&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Each of the two players controls a team of 11 batsmen, two of whom must always be batting at the same time.
