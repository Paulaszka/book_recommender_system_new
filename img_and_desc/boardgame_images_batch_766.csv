Each player takes on the role of one of 12 transient characters who stalk the back alleys and gutters, rifling through dumpsters in search of valuable trash.&#10;&#10;Whether you&rsquo;re a crust punk, a hobo rail-rider, a trust fund poseur, or Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s actual ghost, all players have the same ultimate goal: rootin&rsquo; around in the trash til you&rsquo;ve collected the booze, smokes, snax, and dope you need to summon the TRASH LORD and be anointed his one true glorious Trash Child.&#10;&#10;Players can take up to 4 actions on their turn (skitch from venue to venue, dig for things in the dumpsters, trash cards from their hand to take advantage of special actions, stash things they've collected in the Squat, sacrifice cards for special &quot;blessings&quot; from the Trash Lord, panhandle to get more HP, and more). The first player to have all 4 things (booze, snax, smokes, and dope) in their stash and play a SUMMON card at the Altar wins the game.&#10;&#10;Each dumpster is different, and some more dangerous. Digging deeper can yield more rewards, but it&rsquo;s also askin&rsquo; for trouble. This town is lousy with cops, and the nefarious garbage critters known as Trashlings are waiting in the shadows to swipe your beautiful junk. Even your fellow street urchins might just get wasted and jump you if your stash is lookin&rsquo; a little too tempting. If you run out of HP, you're dead. Players must carefully manage their turns and constantly be on the move (and on their guard) as they booze, scrap, panhandle, and race to be the first to summon the TRASH LORD (peace be upon him).&#10;&#10;"

There are three types of space ships in Sunship. Combat is played out on special cards on which the placement of space ships is significant.

These air races galvanized interest across the world and encouraged by generous prizes by newspapers and other sponsors attracted international entries. Air travel was risky and most unreliable. Often only a small number of the entrants would make it to the finish line. Will one of your pilots manage to face up to the challenge?  But watch out: In this era of gentlemanly behavior and stiff upper lips, there are a few cads and bounders who will cheat to win.&#10;&#10;In Magnificent Flying Machines, the player who ends the game with the most victory points wins. These can be earned in various ways including being the first to land successfully on a certain terrain tile, landing on the middle airfield, transporting cargo or passengers, or performing trick maneuvers. Simply being the first to cross the finishing line is unlikely to be enough on its own to secure a victory. The winner will be the player who picks a strategy that best matches the abilities of the pilot and features of the flying machine they are using.&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. A round begins with the first player taking a turn. Each player takes their turn in order clockwise around the table. During a turn a player has two action phases available. There are three types of action phase to choose from. These are the takeoff phase (which may also include refueling, repairing and scavenging spare parts), the flying phase (which may also include gaining altitude and performing trick maneuvers), and the landing phase (which may also include refueling). In addition, whenever a flying machine lands on a terrain tile any passengers that wish to will disembark, and any cargo intended for that terrain type is unloaded. It may also take on available equipment, cargo and passengers if space is available to do so.&#10;&#10;Players progress in the game by passing a series of takeoff, flying and landing tests. To determine the difficulty of a particular test, first look at the number of symbols for that test shown on the terrain tile that the flying machine is on. Simply add the number of symbols shown on the terrain tile to the number of symbols on the relevant weather tile. If a player needs to take a test, first check to see the total number of relevant symbols shown on the flying machine dashboard. This is the number of dice that may be rolled when attempting to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test. If the player does not roll enough symbols they may then choose to make use of special equipment, use spare parts, or play trick and boost cards to obtain additional symbols in order to pass the test. If a player is unable to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test then a failure occurs. If the dice rolled include a catastrophic failure symbol, then a catastrophic failure occurs. The effects of such a failure vary depending on the test being taken.&#10;&#10;"

Neighbors are divided into two types - orthogonal and diagonal. The piece can be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors are less than it is now. Their color does not matter. The piece can also be moved to any empty triangle, where the number of neighbors does not change, but orthogonal ones among them become less.

The Japanese knew this as well and had prepared accordingly. Another thing unique to the planning was that the 2 landing beaches chosen would be 7 miles apart. It was unprecedented for two landing forces to land with such a wide separation.&#10;&#10;Guam &ndash; Return to Glory will be the second game to utilize the Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 4 maps.&#10;&#10;The game will come with 6 scenarios and 1 campaign game:&#10;&#10;W-Day &ndash; Fortune favors the bold &ndash; This is the first day of the Invasion on the northern beaches. 3rd Marine Division must land against Japanese defenders dug-in on a ridge overlooking the beaches. Single map and 8 turns long.&#10;&#10;W-Day &ndash; Send in the Fire Brigade &ndash; This is the first day of the Invasion on the southern beaches. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade must land and fight their way north towards Orote Peninsular to join up the to beachheads. Single map and 8 turns long.&#10;&#10;W-DAY - This is the first day of the Invasion on the both beaches. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade must land and fight their way north, whilst the 3rd Marines fight their way south and the two forces try to join up the two beachheads near Orote Peninsular. Two maps and 8 turns long.&#10;&#10;Orote Peninsular &ndash; The first 8 days of the fighting saw the Americans expand their beachheads and join up so as to cut off the Orote peninsular with it's important airfield. Once it was cut off, the Americans, then, had to force their way into the heaviest defended area on Guam not knowing that the Japanese were preparing a Sake fueled Banzai charge. Two maps and 72 turns long.&#10;&#10;Into the Jungle - This scenario covers 3rd Marine Division's drive north of the beachheads to take the town of Agana and the airfield at Tiyan. One map and 27 turns long.&#10;&#10;Santa Rosa - This scenario covers 77th Infantry Division's attack to isolate the area around Mount Santa Rosa . One map and 27 turns long.&#10;&#10;The Battle for Guam &ndash; The full historical campaign from 21st July- 10th August (188 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Guam in 1944, from the first invasion at Asan, in the north, and Agat, in the south through the vicious fighting in the thick vegetation at the south end of the island and the final Japanese stand in the north.&#10;&#10;Complexity: 6&#10;&#10;Solitaire Suitability:8&#10;&#10;Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 hours&#10;&#10;Map Scale: 1 hex = 500 meters&#10;&#10;Unit Scale: Companies and below&#10;&#10;Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 4 players as well as solitaire&#10;&#10;Playing Time: 2-35 hours&#10;&#10;Series Designer: Adam Starkweather&#10;&#10;Game Designer: Ross Mortell&#10;&#10;Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;&#10;Artist: Antonio Pinar Pe&ntilde;a&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;4 maps&#10;&#10;6 countersheets&#10;&#10;1 series Rulesbook&#10;&#10;1 game specific rulesbook&#10;&#10;7 player aids, charts, tables cards&#10;&#10;2 ten-sided dice&#10;&#10;1 Box and Lid set&#10;&#10;"

In that time, players around the world have grown to love Starmada for its shallow learning curve, depth of experience, and ease of play, even as they differ over which release represents the One True Vision.&#10;&#10;The goal of this edition, designated PROJECT UNITY, was to draw from the best parts of each incarnation of the game, from the Compendium and Starmada X, through the Admiralty Edition and 2012's Nova Rulebook, and unify those concepts in a way that allows experienced starship captains to continue enjoying the game they love while drawing new players into the fold.&#10;&#10;Long-time players will be thrilled to learn there is no need to convert existing starship designs to this new edition: comprehensive rules are included which allow players to use both Admiralty and Nova ship display sheets with a minimum of modification.&#10;&#10;With the release of the Unity Rulebook, we hope to revitalize the game and introduce the thrills of tabletop battles in deep space to a whole new generation.

This game is just about that. You may come across animals 'endemic to' - found only in - that place as well as other wild animals found in that biosphere. The game covers vast biospheres that are spread across a few hundred square kilometres.&#10;&#10;You score points from the animals you sight on the game cards. The rare or difficult-to-find animals get you higher points. The game ends when all cards are drawn. However, we have gamers who have developed their 'own' ways to end the game. You can do it too. The player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;This game is almost entirely controlled by the dice. Ideal for children aged 6 years or more.&#10;&#10;While safari-goers share their experiences eagerly with other fellow safari-goes in a 'real' one, players swap their hands in this game. Or you could be punished with a missed turn if you overspeed or make too much noise and disturb wildlife.&#10;&#10;There are basic strategy bits too. For instance, how you would make use of the special cards: the Paapa card or the Kaadoo card. You can use these cards when you need them, you do not have to play these cards immediately. Or you have the 'turnaround' card that lets you make a complete u-turn and go in the reverse direction. You can play this card if you appear to be leaving the forest in the next few rounds.&#10;&#10;The safari course is fixed and you cannot go off that. But, there are a good number of elements from the game that make it refreshing every time you play it. For example, on-board elements such as 'move to the nearest water body', bonus card pick  from an alarm call.&#10;&#10;We have tried to recreate the experience for those who are completely new to safaris as well as seasoned safari-goers. The game board tries to capture the signature of the terrain - arid, dull or lush green as the case may be.&#10;&#10;"
