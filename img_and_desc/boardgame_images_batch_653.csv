How many headbands were worn? Or how many weapons were pointing to the left? Was the second Indian from the right painted with war paint? Or is there an Indian wearing a shirt, and carrying a tomahawk? The player who is able to give the first correct answer, gains a token.&#10;&#10;The 10 playing cards in Kiqsuyapi are double-sided. They determine the level of difficulty of the game. With only 4 cards, the challenge is still moderate. With 10 cards even true champions are going to work up a sweat. And if you still consider this too easy, the expert version will be an even greater challenge for you. Here, all players have to answer and the right answer will gain you a point, as before. Wrong answers, however, will cost you points! This applies in particular to those questions that ask for two or even three aspects at once. For example, how many Indians are wearing a shirt, a headdress and are carrying a bow?&#10;&#10;"

All this to gather as much status as possible.&#10;&#10;Epoch: Early Inventors is very thematic and tries to stay as close to reality as possible.&#10;&#10;Before starting the game you build a landscape of hexagonal playing cards and holy places.&#10;&#10;In your turn you can carry out 1 action and/or develop 1 card and/or offer to 1 holy place.&#10;&#10;You can choose between the following actions: gather food, fish (for food), hunt for deer, butcher deer, explore adjacent cards or work to get raw material.&#10;&#10;You need food to move around the game board and develop cards. Gathering food and fishing are basically the same actions, but depending on the tools you have, the one action might give you more food than the other.&#10;&#10;You need raw materials to develop cards and offer to the holy places. Sometimes raw materials can help you to heighten the proceeds of actions. The action &quot;Work&quot; can get you raw materials. The type of landscape you are currently standing on determines how much work it is to get hold of a certain raw material. Raw materials used in the game are: wood, flax, stone, flint, clay and iron ore.&#10;&#10;Butchering animals can not only get you food, but also skins, bones and tendons.&#10;&#10;Exploring cards adds to your status. It also opens up more cards to be developed.&#10;&#10;To develop a card, you need to &quot;pay&quot; the food and materials depicted on the card.&#10;&#10;Once you have developed a card, you can use the tool, equipment or knowledge of this card to your advantage. E.g. Rope Making allows you to turn 2 flax into 3 ropes. Sowing gives you 2-4 extra food, when gathering food. An axe makes it easier to chop wood.&#10;&#10;By cleverly using your own cards and those of your opponents, you try to offer materials to as many holy places as you can, thereby increasing your status even more.&#10;&#10;After 14-20 rounds the game is over.

To combine the cards you must put them in the 3x3 grids and achieve to match the arrows (for example, a card in the second row and second column with an up arrow matches with a card with a down arrow that is in the first row and second column). The effect is determined by the greatest symbol value (except neutral, that haves no effect), in case of draw (for example, 2 sword and 2 crosses) the player chooses what effect it should be. Attack effect (sword) deducts 1 point of defence from the life of the opponent for each sword in the combination OR you can disable a card in the rival's 3x3 grid. Defence adds to the player 1 point of life for each shield in the combination. Revitalization can undisable 1 card in your grid.&#10;&#10;There are 2 ways to win the game: by reducing the rival's life to 0 OR when the rival have cards in the hand and cannot play a card (the grid is filled with 9 cards that cannot combine in this turn) It should be noted that when a player haves 0 cards in its deck, losses 1 point of life at the start of his turn.&#10;&#10;"

Each turn has 3&#10;Rounds where victory condition varies.&#10;&#10;- Round 1: The highest card wins.&#10;- Round 2: The lowest card wins.&#10;- Round 3: The intermediate cards win.&#10;&#10;Each Round can be won by more than one player, if they match the score or&#10;victory condition. For example, in a 5-player game, up to 3 of them could have&#10;the intermediate card that gives the victory in Round 3.&#10;&#10;When all 3 Rounds have been played, the starting player becomes Dealer.&#10;Thereby, all players will be Dealer once throughout the game.&#10;In each Round -in order, beginning with the starting player- players secretly&#10;choose a card from their hand and place it in their playing area face down&#10;They must choose between:&#10;- Exchange your card with the player on the left (they cannot refuse). The&#10;Dealer player has no players on their left. If you&rsquo;re Dealer and want to&#10;exchange your card, you can do it with the deck, first declaring it aloud. To&#10;do this, you must lift one or more cards at a time without looking. The card&#10;revealed after this cut is your new card.&#10;- To fold, that is, to keep the card that you&rsquo;ve chosen or that&rsquo;s been given to&#10;you after a previous exchange.&#10;- Use the ability of the card, if possible (Merchant, Thief, Juggler and Dragon).&#10;- If you have cards in hand, change the card with one of your hand.&#10;Once all the players have played, reveal players&acute;cards to activate the abilities&#10;&ldquo;At the end of the Round...&rdquo; of the cards that have this ability (Innkeeper,&#10;Jester, Monk, Sorceress, Knight, Princess and Queen).&#10;&#10;The winners of each Round score a point. To indicate that they take the score&#10;markers and place them in their playing area according to their points value.&#10;Once the 3 Rounds have been played, the deck is formed and shuffled again,&#10;and a new turn begins.&#10;When the last Dealer player&rsquo;s turn is finished, the points are counted. The&#10;SECOND player with the most victory points is declared an absolute winner&#10;of Death Over The Kingdom until the next game!&#10;In case all players are tied in highest and lowest points, no player wins this&#10;game. You will have to play again!&#10;&#10;"

They were even able to expand into a couple of diamond mines. It seems reasonable to invest our recent yield here in Mombasa, rather than to continue our unrivalled commitment in Cape Town. After all, it can only be to our advantage to have other irons in the fire. And when the day of reckoning comes, it will show whether our hoarding of holdings and our intransigent eagerness are worth it...&quot;&#10;&#10;Mombasa is a tense Euro-style strategy game set in 19th century Africa in which players invest in four chartered companies. Using influence to help them expand across the continent improves the value of the players' shares in these companies. Players will also trade in bananas, coffee or cotton, work together with diamond merchants and ensure that the accounts are kept up to date. To make the most of this one will need to have the correct action cards (back) in hand at the same time, which needs excellent forward planning.&#10;&#10;Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play: Players start with an identical hand, but acquire new and more powerful cards from the rotating display throughout the game. Each round players choose action cards from their hand, place them face down in the so-called action slot (beneath the player board), and then reveal them simultaneously to carry out the actions. At the end of the action phase, each card is moved to the so-called resting slot (above the player board). Cards in the resting slots are inactive and cannot be used until they are recovered - each round one can only return cards of one resting slot which is why it can make quite a difference in which action slots certain cards are placed.&#10;&#10;The game ends after seven rounds, players add up their scores in different categories, and the player with the highest score (who has earned the most money) wins the game. With a variety of paths to victory and double-sided company boards, each game will be a new and different challenge.&#10;&#10;"
