The fate of the coast is in your hands!&#10;&#10;This fully cooperative game features a 4-way dice tower as the oil rig, which randomly drops oil dice onto the four quadrants of the game board. In this respect, the game is a reverse tower defense game, as players sail the perimeter trying to push back and contain the oil, remove dice from the water and save the sea life.&#10;&#10;Communal resource cards are chosen by the team before the game begins and are then powered for use by either removing 3 oil dice from the game or saving a full set of 6 marine creatures.  Weather dice complicate matters adding new challenges for the round that restrict movement, drop more dice or increase the cost of operations. It takes coordination and teamwork to win, as new oil dice are dropped at the beginning of every turn and the number of oil dice dropped increases over the course of the game.&#10;&#10;If the team can accomplish all three objectives on their WIN Condition card and remedy any potential losing conditions on the board by the end of a given turn - they win. Otherwise the game will end when the 60 dice from the bag are exhausted or they are unable to correct one of the three losing conditions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

A familiarity with the books will lead to a quick understanding of how the game is played.&#10;&#10;The Kingdom of Arrethtrae is divided into thirty territories. At the beginning of the game, each territory is occupied and controlled by the Dark Knight and his Shadow Warriors. The mission is to retake as many of the territories for the Prince as possible before He returns on His ship as He journeys from the Kingdom Across the Sea. It will take Him ten rounds of play to reach the city of Chessington. Once the Prince reaches the docks at Chessington, the game is over. Every knight has the opportunity to retake one territory on each turn by battling against Shadow Warriors and possibly creatures. If a knight is able to retake a territory on his turn, he will acquire a precious resource or weapon to help fight future battles. A knight will usually not know the scope of the battle until he or she enters the territory and draws a battle card. The knight may face a single Shadow Warrior, multiple Shadow Warriors, creatures, and even a Stronghold. Weapons and resources will be necessary to retake a territory with creatures or Strongholds.&#10;&#10;One to six players can play the game, but there will always be six knights represented on the board. For example, if there is only one player, he will control all six of the knights. If there are three players, each player will control two knights. For four or five players, one or two of the players must control two knights or those knights can be controlled by all players jointly. All six knights are encouraged to work together and strategize on how to recover as many territories as possible. Only through teamwork and keen strategy is a team of knights successful. Victory occurs in varying degrees, for each territory and its people are precious to the Prince. Ultimate victory occurs when all thirty territories are recovered before the Prince arrives.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
