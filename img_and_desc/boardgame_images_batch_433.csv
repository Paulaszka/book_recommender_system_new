Unlike chess, Shogi pieces are flat, all the same color, and pentagonal. Ownership of a piece is indicated by the direction it is pointing. When you capture a piece, you may on a later turn place that piece on the board and use it as your own.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has five pieces, which appear from left-to-right in the following order:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tokin, which moves like a Gold General (Lance)&#10;     Silver General (Bishop)&#10;     King&#10;     Gold General (Knight)&#10;     Pawn (Rook)&#10;&#10;&#10;The name in parenthesis is the piece's promoted value; when a piece promotes. it is flipped to its promoted side. However, the unusual feature that this game shares with Kyoto Shogi is that a piece must promote (and demote) every time it is moved.&#10;&#10;Because of the geometry of the hexagonal board, some pieces have more, and less, mobility than its counterparts on a square board.

74970,,"Premise:&#10;&#10;You are a group of nerds and/or geeks who have discovered a secret tomb of a long-gone fanatic of geek/nerddom.  Inside you discover a spiraling tower of RPG, video game, and movie stereotypes of every sort on each floor, and must collect treasures and artifacts  from each of them in order to challenge the Master Ghost and claim the title of Master Geek for yourself.&#10;&#10;But meanwhile, a deranged, shadowy psychopathic killer stalks your strongest party member, believing that he would get your champion's powers if he kills him/her.  He's slow, but insanely powerful, and to meet him would mean almost certain doom.&#10;&#10;Once someone challenges and defeats the Master Geek, the dungeon starts crumbling, but the psycho-killer still stalks you (unless you killed him before).&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal is to get the most prestige upon exiting the tower, getting prestige points for each treasure item collected, each artifact acquired, along with bonus points for the person who defeats the Master Geek and/or the psycho-killer.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The players start outside of the tower, and walk inside to a lobby and a staircase leading upwards, where they may or may not encounter enemies.  These are all represented by cards.  The stairways/lobbies and tower corridors/rooms are represented by wider and larger cards, and each detail a special conditional effect that takes place with everyone who stays in the corridor/room/stairway/lobby, even if the conditional effect is &quot;this is just a normal room.&quot;  Some examples include rooms where battles are tougher in some way, rooms where each player's gender is changed, rooms where there's treasure lying everywhere, and a room where all the enemies are flying and thus are more difficult to fight.&#10;&#10;The tower begins unexplored.  As players explore the tower, going up stairs and walking through the floors, a room/stairway/floor effect card is drawn and placed onto any unexplored space they walk into.  If a room is empty (void of monsters) upon entry, a new battle is triggered.&#10;&#10;Battles are fought with a bit of luck combined with overall strength.  Each floor has a certain &quot;battle size&quot; (with certain rooms having increased battle sizes), which determine the number of monsters that can fight in any single battle.  Upon entering the previously mentioned empty room, players draw a number of encounter cards (which are smaller than the room cards) equal to the battle size of the floor/room they are on.  The encounter cards can include everything from the monsters themselves, to traps and curses that affect a character negatively, to positive boons, and any number of special training (which allows the characters to have a class analogous to the genre they are currently fighting in, or a DNA transformation that allows them to do something very similar with their &quot;race&quot; (includes standard fantasy races in floors 1-2, &quot;horror&quot; races like vampires and werewolves in floor 3, and so on...).  If a character draws the number of encounter cards required and ends up not having to fight a battle equal to the battle size of the room/floor, other players can add additional monsters to increase the battle up to the battle size.  Other players can also play cards to strengthen either side.  Multiple monsters add to each other's strengths, and special other cards allow players to add monsters beyond the maximum battle size.  Players can also negotiate another player's help if the other player is on the same floor.  Battles are fought by rolling a d12, and adding the result to each side's total strength.&#10;&#10;If a monster is defeated, the player who is playing his turn may find a special floor artifact (each of which adds to a character's strength) if the monster was sufficiently powerful enough.  In order to enter the top floor, the players need a certain amount of artifacts from each floor below.  Monsters also drop loot, and players can pick up a certain amount of loot each turn.  Other players can also swerve in to raid a large loot pile.  Loot can include anything that could be considered treasure: equipment that add to character strength, free artifacts, temporary power-ups (like grenades and pixie dust), protection items, and items that are otherwise worthless but are value at high currency (totaled for points in the end).  If a player doesn't fight a battle in a room he's entered, he can draw additional encounter cards for future (or immediate) use.&#10;&#10;Once a player has acquired a certain number of artifacts from each floor, he can enter the top floor, where the Master Geek resides.  Battles there are tougher than any other floor, and draw from the monsters that the players might have encountered previously on every other floor.  The players might also encounter the Master Geek himself, who's obviously a lot stronger than those tougher battles.  If a player manages to defeat him, the tower starts crumbling (one room/stairway is removed at the end of each player's turn), and the players' goal is to then escape the falling tower).&#10;&#10;A twist is that there's an insanely powerful psycho-killer who's always stalking the strongest player (changing targets if that position is taken by another player).  He only moves 2 rooms per turn cycle (each player can always move 3), but if he catches you, it's very bad news.  It's very likely he'll kill the character [i]and[/i] drain him of several artifacts (other monsters can kill you as well, but he's the one that'll probably have the easiest time doing it).  He's still stalking you once the tower starts crumbling, and very likely, he'll be standing between your characters and the exit.  If a player dies, they respawn at the entrance, but leave all their equipment and items as loot in the last room they were in (free for other players to raid, or to get lost in the crumbling of the tower at the end).&#10;&#10;When all characters have exited the tower successfully after the defeat of the Master Geek, points are calculated, factoring in: 1) the amount of treasure/equipment a player has retained, 2) how many other players the player beat to the exit, 3) how many artifacts the player has acquired, 4) whether or not the player was the one to defeat the Master Geek, and 5) if the player defeated the Psycho.  Whoever is found to have the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

By effective speculation on the stock market, a player may take control of more than one corporation. Proper corporation management is preferable but not the most essential.&#10;The rules attempt to simulate real conditions of business competition and relationships between shareholders.&#10;&#10;THERE IS NO LUCK FACTOR.&#10;Internal balance discourages to play in a relation of 2(3) players versus 1.&#10;&#10;Most of the rules are quite easy and intuitive. It is the most difficult to use the rules effectively by good planning and predicting opponents&rsquo; plans.&#10;Players manage their corporations by investing in new factories and trading produced goods to earn money (like in many other games). The point is what the players do with earned money. They can re-invest it to make their corporations earn more during next phase or try to make pressure on another player by buying shares of his/her corporation. The player who has the biggest number of shares can be elected by voting as a new leader of the corporation for the next stage. Even if you don`t have enough shares to take control over another player`s firm, the investment can be quite beneficiary because it can give you some profit (if that firm is managed well) or enforce your opponent to use the corporation money for defending, which makes his final result worse than could be achieved without your pressure.&#10;&#10;Of course, the more players (max 4), the more fun there is during voting phase when all the shareholders, who are going to manage the corporation in the next stage, vote.&#10;&#10;The game tries to extract maximum advantage of double circulation of money you can find in the &quot;Imperial&quot;. Players have money and corporations have money. So, what is new then? Besides the players, also the corporations can be shareholders and they all (corporations and players) vote for new leaders. It means that if you want to keep control over a corporation you had started with, you can, for instance, first take control over some weaker corporation which has some shares of yours. The best defense is attack, isn`t it? ;) The only weapon in this war is money.&#10;&#10;There are some tools of defense, so taking control over experienced opponent`s corporation is rather difficult, though possible. When an experienced player plays versus a beginner, he/she shouldn`t have a problem with it. Moreover, keeping control of the corporation is useful, because it is a way of generating money for the leader, although speculating by buying and selling shares is a bit more efficient. It is the best to go both ways at the same time, choosing and changing your engagement alternately.&#10;&#10;Well, it is also possible to play without any corporation and increase the value of private property only by playing as a stock market profiteer, but this way is recommended only for very experienced players.&#10;&#10;There is a fixed variant of playing 2 vs. 2.&#10;&#10;"

Ruled by the Councils of the four Cliques, the city is spilt into two prosperous disctricts. Players are in control of one of these two districts, and by drafting and playing cards depicting the city's Characters, they attempt to secure the support of the councils and have the best inhabitants.&#10;&#10;The game begins with players drafting the 64 character cards to form two 32 card decks, one for each player.  During the player's turn, the player gains actions to play Character cards into his district.  Each character belongs to one of the four cliques, and many have special abilities, called Traits, that occur when they are placed into a district from a player's hand.  Additionally, at the end of a player's turn, the player will place a card from his hand face down on one of the council cards.  When a Character with the Ksari trait is played in a district, the corresponding Clique Council is convened, and the player with the highest value of face down cards wins the support of the convened council.&#10;&#10;Players score points for the Characters in their districts, as well as points for the Council support they have received.&#10;&#10;"

Denny Jr.&#10;Published by Samuel French &#10;Format: small book&#10;Original price: 50 cents&#10;&#10;From the introduction:&#10;&quot;The purpose of the game is to provide theatrical entertainment for clubs or drawing-rooms in which the audience shall take the part of witnesses of an event being enacted before them. After the performance the audience will be cross examined on what they have observed and will be asked to solve the mystery.&quot;&#10;&#10;User summary:&#10;Detecto-Plays contains 6 short plays that are intended to be fleshed out by a small cast.  At the end the audience will be asked by the director ten questions.  Each question that is answered correctly is worth 10 points.  Wrong or incomplete answers are worth nothing.  Some of them are single scenes plays, some have as many as six scenes.&#10;&#10;This appears to be a very early version of modern murder-mystery party games. It's unusual in that the scenarios and dialogs were written by two playwrights that were producing work for New York theatres at the time.&#10;&#10;One of the scenarios also includes a game within the game as the actors play a game called &quot;murder&quot; which appears to be a popular  party game at the time, similar to &quot;Are you a werewolf?&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Players start the game creating little ColorMonsters made of 3 segments, each segment having one mouth. Each round, the stones (meteorites) are placed on the board. From them, ColorMonsters harvest gems (and Action cards)&mdash;as many as the number of their mouths face the stone. Players trade gems with each other and sell them to the bank for Galaxy money, using them to buy Gold, and Action Cards  from the bank. Each round, the ColorMonster can grow up one two-mouth segment, up to 7 segments. ColorMonsters can move on the board to make more gems and hinder other ColorMonsters in making gems. To win the player(s) needs to collect 7 Golds.&#10;&#10;"
