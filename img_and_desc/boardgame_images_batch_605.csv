Cards may add or remove cards from cauldrons, cause players to draw or discard cards, give or take away warts, and plenty more specific gameplay-manipulating effects.&#10;&#10;Number of players for one deck can be 2-6, although larger numbers of players can be supported by simply mixing in an additional deck.&#10;&#10;"

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.&#10;&#10;In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.&#10;&#10;Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.&#10;&#10;When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.&#10;&#10;Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.&#10;&#10;NOTE: this description is out-of-date.&#10;&#10;"

Having no children of his own issue, any claim to his rather sizable fortune must issue from his legal will.  Unfortunately the Baron not only wrote many different wills in the last years of his life, it seems he tore them all to shreds.  The six known claimants have been given twelve hours to prove their rights to inherit.  As one of these claimants, you must search the Baron&rsquo;s country manor to find fragments of the will which name you as heir.&#10;&#10;Would that it were only that simple.&#10;&#10;The other potential heirs are collecting their claims as well, and there&rsquo;s nothing to stop them from picking up your fragments to keep you from having them.  Some might even stoop so low as to steal claims you&rsquo;ve already gathered!  Keep in mind that opportunities also exist for collaboration, however, and that a winning strategy often includes working with your opponents when the time is right.&#10;&#10;As if the competing heirs weren&rsquo;t enough to complicate your efforts, the End itself is an ode to the many peculiarities of the Redmayne family.  An ancient structure, expanded and updated haphazardly many times over the centuries, even the oldest members of the staff know only a portion of its secrets.  These individuals are key to your success, providing invaluable aid not merely in collecting your claims but also in successfully traversing the dangers of the house which may at times seem an implacable opponent.  For as you race from room to room, the house itself will interfere with your movement.&#10;&#10;Grisleigh End is also a tribute to the mystery fiction and the authors who have entertained generations of readers.  The artwork references hundreds of golden age mystery novels and short stories, from The Abbey Grange by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to The Zero Clue by Rex Stout, and dozens of mystery authors represented, from Margery Allingham to Israel Zangwill.&#10;&#10;"

It is played upon a board laid out in squares or rectangles, and the pieces employed represent and symbolize the important men and weapons of warfare, while their movements simulate the military evolutions of two armies opposed in battle, advancing, retreating and engaging in the diverse methods that characterize actual warfare, and employing all the various forms of strategy.&#10;&#10;Each side, as a fighting force, comprises a king, a commanding officer, field and siege artillery, cavalry and ordinary troops and flying machines.&#10;&#10;All the movements of Chess are found in the game, and, in addition, the troops have the movements made familiar in checkers or draughts, while some pieces are given different moves, and more freedom of movement than in either Chess or Checkers. But while these two games are thus drawn on to contribute all their virtues, the vital principle of The Game of War is radically different and wholly new.&#10;&#10;In Chess the game is won when a player so hems in his adversary's king that it cannot escape capture; in Checkers all of the adversary's pieces must be captured and taken from the board, or the last of them penned, to secure a victory.&#10;&#10;In The Game of War, however, the object is to lay siege to and capture the citadel &mdash; a central square in the king's rank on which the ruler is stationed at the outset of the game. When an adversary's piece can enter and hold this square without being captured at the next move, such occupancy of the citadel wins the game.&#10;&#10;Chief of the many other distinctive features in The Game of War is the introduction of two flying machines on each side. The purpose and the movements of these are wholly novel, and give a singular fascination to the playing of the game. Moreover, the board used in the game is of a new design, having one hundred squares, instead of sixty-four, as in chess and checkers, and the all-important citadel square stands forth in battlemented prominence. In addition, there are four flying machine stations.&quot;&#10;&#10;"

No separate board or pieces are required as the cards themselves represent squares of a growing board that takes shape as the game progresses.  A deck consists of 64 cards.  Each player uses 16 cards, matching the pieces and pawns of a standard chess set. They can choose one of four colours (white, black, red and blue).&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt, face-up, into shuffled 'Battleplans' from which cards are played, in the shuffled order, into a central playing area.  Each card represents a square of a chess board.  A square can be occupied (card face-up) or unoccupied (face-down).  On each turn, a card is either placed as a piece/pawn or empty square; or moved according to traditional chess movement rules &ndash; but they can only move within the board squares already created.  When a card is placed (a new square), it must be connected to an existing square of the board.  When a card moves, it is swapped with the destination card so the growing board is preserved.&#10;&#10;Kings can be placed on any turn where there are at least six empty squares on the board.  If a player chooses to do so, all opponents must use their next turn to place their King.  The aim of En Prise, like chess,  is to checkmate opposing Kings.  When a player is checkmated, their board cards are turned over to become empty squares on their next turn.  The winner is the last remaining player.&#10;&#10;Variations described in the rules include En Prise Casino, En Prise Alliance, En Prise Memory and En Prise Blind.&#10;&#10;"

Action takes place in a fantasy world of Eador which is broken into pieces of a past holistic world, surfing across the Astral. Players take roles of the Masters, mighty demigods, trying to subordinate as many Eador shards as possible. They forward armies to conquer new territories, cast spells and perform powerful rituals.&#10;&#10;The board game suits for 2-6 players but it&rsquo;s mostly comfortable to play for at least 4 players. All players get their Master cards at the game start &ndash; such cards exist not only for the atmosphere, they also help to settle some controversies. 12-18 shard cards (amount depends on the number of players) are mixed up to a separate pile and the game is over when this pile flows out. There are always two shard cards on the table, the one for the current round and another for the next &ndash; it helps players to plan their moves concentrating on the shards which are easier to get. Shard conquering is performed by playing action cards; there are more then 100 of them &ndash; armies, spells and rituals. At the game beginning everyone gets 7 action cards to the hand. Usually it&rsquo;s possible to add only one more card during the turn so using them should be careful. Rituals are the cards with especially strong features letting, for example, to take more action cards, take someone else&rsquo;s action or shard cards, to gain more winning points. Player can&rsquo;t fight for the chard during the turn if he performs a ritual but these cards give him further advantage.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the round each player decides if he will fight for the current shard or not. You need to play an army or a spell card to join a battle. The most important feature of the army is its power. Also there are the type of the army on the card (Light, Chaos or neutral), its class (warrior, monster, magician or undead) and nature of the ground (hills, swamps, plains, forests). Armies and some spells stay in the battle to the end of the round, some spells work only for the round they were played at. The result of the battle round is counted when all players interested in the shard have made their moves. The owner of the strongest army gets authority points counters according to his advantage above the second contender. Players can give up from the second turn and leave the battle. In this case they can&rsquo;t play armies or spells anymore for the current battle but still have a chance to win if nobody acquires more authority points. When all players pass the battle ends and the shard goes to the player who gained maximum authority points.&#10;&#10;Each battle has some pieces of subtleties. Firstly, it&rsquo;s impossible to play Light and Chaos armies without a special card. Secondly, all the shards are different: some of them give advantages to defined type or class of armies or restrict using them, others allow to play two armies in a round. Thirdly, all armies fighting for the shard at the &ldquo;native&rdquo; land get extra strength. Attentive player will get a big profit considering all these features. When battle for the last shard is over players count their winning points on their conquered shards and performed rituals. That sum shows the winner.&#10;&#10;The game for two or three players differs &ndash; they get 3 or 2 Master cards and make more actions during the round &ndash; to play a ritual and take part in the battle.&#10;&#10;"

Players simultaneously roll their dice and assign them in order to put boats in the water, fire off the cannons, gather more crew, engage the enemy at close quarters, or move their treasure ever closer to safety.  Players are rewarded for their ability to adapt and their quick decision making skills - a little luck and a hint of greed never hurt a buccaneer either!&#10;&#10;Think you can captain your crew better than any of the other sea dogs at the table?  If so, grab a cutlass and set sail on the rolling seas in Tortuga - a quick-paced family dice game for 2-4 buccaneers (aged 8 and above) that plays in around 30 minutes!  Yo ho ho!&#10;&#10;"
