Markers are removed from the board if they are surrounded by their opponents markers, or have one or fewer neighbors.&#10;&#10;This means that games of Kansho are often won or lost on a single critical move that can occur at any time during the game. Players must therefore play with precision and cunning in order to be victorious.&#10;&#10;The rules of Kansho are few and simple to grasp but a great deal of practice and skill is required in order to master the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

This new edition includes a total re-branding and new game mechanics/components.&#10;&#10;CardsLab Countries is a turn-based game and the goal is to reach a certain amount of mission points or conquer all the opponents' country cards, which are evenly distributed, forming an upside down stack in front of each player. Each turn has a turn owner that has advantages in the mission and battle phases described below.&#10;&#10;Each country card features its national flag, world location and capital, as well as stats like population, life expectancy or GDP.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, three mission cards are distributed and placed in front of each player, which allow them to score points and earn special cards by forming combinations with their country cards in hand. There are two types of missions which score points based on their difficulty: easy (1 point) and hard (3 points). The first player to achieve 10 points wins the game (for the fast game mode - average duration of 30 minutes).&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of special cards that players earn by completing missions:&#10;- Steal the turn (become the turn owner)&#10;- Double the turn prize&#10;- Exchange all hand cards between 2 players&#10;- Search for a card in your own pile&#10;- Cancel any of these effects&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of 5 phases: Draw, Mission, Special, Battle and Prize.&#10;&#10;Draw phase: Each player draws cards from his stack until having 5 country cards in hand.&#10;&#10;Mission phase: Starting with the turn owner, each player tries to accomplish missions with their country cards. When a mission is completed, the country cards used to accomplish that mission are placed at the bottom of the players' card pile and the accomplished missions are placed at the bottom of the missions pile. The player can also discard one or more missions. At the end of the phase, players update their scorecard and receive new missions.&#10;&#10;Special phase: Each player can play his special cards, one at a time.&#10;&#10;Battle phase: The turn owner chooses a card from the hand, puts it upside down on the table and decides between asking a question about the card to an opponent (flag/location/capital, depending on the thrown dice value by the opponent) or choose a statistic that will have to beat all opponents' cards. For the latter, after the turn owner announces the chosen statistic, each opponent picks a card from their own hand and plays it face-down on the table, to win the battle. This adds an element of suspense and bluffing on each turn, forcing players to carefully choose their plays. Note: the number of possible questions depends on each players' difficulty level. For the easiest level, the player only has to answer the cards' continent.&#10;&#10;Prize phase: The winner of the Battle phase receives a number of cards from opponents' hands, based on the number of special cards played, the duel type (question or combat), and player count.&#10;&#10;CardsLab is a fun, educational, trivia and strategy game for ages 8-80, designed with simple mechanics that can easily bring together three generations of players to the same table. It features difficulty levels tailored to a variety of gamers, and without noticing it, they are learning as they play.&#10;&#10;Pedro Gordalina, CardsLab Designer.&#10;&#10;"

Below are some of the current available game modes:&#10;&#10;Chestego-WAR - A game which combines chess with stratego and the addition of dice. The board is 10x10 with special pawns which hide their identity from the opponent until being attacked or attacking. There is also two dice which are used when heroes attack each other (or when attacking the princess pawn). One with a square and one with a triangle. The triangle die is used by the defender while the square die is used by the attacker. The triangle die has a High chance of loosing while the square has a high chance of winning. The lowest number wins. A triangle rolled is a counterattack which kills the attacker. A Square rolled is a miss and the attacker has to move back to the space he attacked from. The game mode is won by killing the king.&#10;&#10;Chestego-WARZ - a 2v2 WAR with the option for free for all if you have 2 more sets or colors or COOP with the standard set. In COOP one player controls the Warrior King while the other controls the Queen. The Warrior King can move up to 3 spaces in any direction so watch out. Also, the player with the King also gets the Assassin. The player with the Queen always get the Princess. The objective is still the same. In free for all there are 4 different colored armies.&#10;&#10;Chestego-EDGE.LINE - Players build edges and lines and try to surround claimed dots to maximize points. There are 100 tiles and the possibility to play between 2-6 players. More players can be added with combined games. The game starts off with players building the Rift 1 piece at a time. The Rift has some starting edges and lines which can be claimed(12 pieces). The remaining 88 pieces are played one at a time until all pieces are played. The player with the highest score wins. The soon to be release app will keep track of each players score. Anything which was not completed gets counted at the end.&#10;&#10;Chestego-RIFT - Players rush to claim resources and towers to build up their forces to be able to attack the enemy. This can be played 1v1 or 2v2 coop. There are resources and outposts which can be built to speed up your attack and slow the attackers. Each side is working to establish their land and is preparing to travel across the Rift. You win by destroying the opponent(s) or forcing a surrender.&#10;&#10;Chestego-JUMPS - 1v1 version of Checkers with some special pieces and a 10x10 board. With 15 Jumpers and 5 Leapers each side. Jumpers can only move forward and can only jump other jumpers. If a Jumper jumps two enemies he is promoted to a Leaper or if he gets to the back line. Leapers can only jump Leapers and Jumpers. There are 5 Leapers to start with which can be promoted to Vaulters if they jump two enemies in a row or get to the back line.Vaulters can jump two pieces right next to each other in a line. Any combination of friend and foe can be jumped. Vaulters can jump anything. If a Vaulter jumps a promoted Leaper he is demoted to a Jumper. The game is won by the player left standing.&#10;&#10;Chestego-JUMPZ - a 4 player version of JUMPS. You will need two additional colors or you can play 2v2 and split the existing pieces into the four corners. Each player gets 2 Leapers and 6 Jumpers. For the Jumpers that have to attack straight ahead. All the remaining rules apply.&#10;&#10;Chestego-NEF - a variation of the Viking board game Hnefatafl with a 9x9 board instead of 11x11 (11x11 could be done with the addition of more board pieces). This version has 3 different piece types instead of the original 2. There is the King which can more unlimited spaces in any straight line. The Valkyries which can also move orthogonally unlimited spaces and the Berserkers which also more the same way. To remove an enemy piece you have to surround it. For Valkyries 2 would have to surround another Valkyrie one on each side to remove it. To remove a Berserker you would have to surround it on four sides with Valkyries or two sides with Berserkers. The King has to always be surrounded on four sides to be removed. The King tries to move to one of the 4 corners where there is a King square that only he can occupy. There is also a King square in the center which only the King can occupy. A King square can be used to surround pieces.&#10;&#10;Chestego-WUR - A variation of the ancient game UR. Players race to move their pieces from the starting area to the ending area. The board can be setup in two ways. One with a longer battle lane and the other one a shorter one. There are also 3 towers used. One for each player's color and one special tower. To move past the center you have to occupy your tower. Once a player is in the tower he is safe and is considered removed. The player can jump down to attack an enemy if he lands in the lane right next to the tower but then he becomes vulnerable to attacks. The game is won by the player who gets all of his or her pieces out first.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

It is designed to be a very simple to learn, yet highly strategical, board game. Its minimal and simple ruleset allows new players of all ages to rapidly engage in action, while reserving great challenges for the chessboard veterans.&#10;&#10;It is a 2 player game and each player gets sixteen pieces.  Fourteen pieces (two sets of 7) marked with a number between 1 ~ 7 and and two pieces marked with an X.  The X marked pieces are called the Dukes.  All pieces are free to move in Queen style movements.  Their imprinted numbers define their step limitations.  Dukes also move freely, but only one step at a time.  The goal of the game is for each player to eliminate both opponent Dukes.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the above three simple rules, plus one optional rule for advanced players. This optional rule limits the movement of a piece, after it crosses the middle line, and requires it to stay at the opponent side of the board until the end of the game. Draw cases are possible and described in the games ruleset.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Then it was developed by the authors in collaboration with the science communication team in the CRG.&#10;&#10;Saca la Lengua / Treu la Llengua is a cooperative game in which players represent members of the general population with certain characteristics of their microbiome (represented in game by 8 genera of bacteria, whose population is represented by the value of 8 dice). The goal is to keep the oral microbiome of the players as close as possible as the ideal equilibrium values (obtained in real life thanks to the research project).&#10;&#10;During 5 rounds, the players do the following actions:&#10;a) Each player with 2 or more genera in equilibrium draws an action card, with which he/she can improve the microbiome of other players.&#10;b) Each player draws a &quot;Life is tough&quot; card and applies its effects on himself. Then a common &quot;Life is tough&quot; card is drawn and it must be applied to one of the players (cooperatively chosen).&#10;&#10;Some cards add some additional &quot;infection&quot; dice or &quot;severe condition&quot; markers. When the players exceed a certain threshold of infection dice or severe condition markers, they lose the game. Otherwise, if they reach the end of the 5th round, they won and calculate points to know the degree of equilibrium of their oral microbiota.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Gods, demi-gods, titans, demons and other-worldly beings from your nightmares came from myth and became reality. Alliances formed and the stage was set for war like never before seen on Earth, or even beneath it.&#10;&#10;Mankind has found itself between colossal forces of legendary power. C&rsquo;thulean terrors rise from the oceans as gods ride winged beasts into battle. Meanwhile, the armies of humanity fight simply to survive. With the awakening of the gods, long dormant demi-gods, mutants, and freaks, have unleashed chaos on the world.&#10;&#10;This new world disorder has left many cities burning husks while the people flee to the remaining bastions of safety and security.&#10;&#10;The Immortal Wars is a table-top strategy game mixing fantasy, modern, science-fiction, and superhero genres. Do battle with tanks, infantry, hovercraft, jet fighters, giant mecha, mutants, superhumans, and abominations.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;The Immortal Wars is played on a flat surface (a minimum of 4' x 6' is recommended) with distances measured in inches (the game uses the curiously mixed ratio of 1 inch to 7.5 meters).  Combatants are represented by miniature figures (representing single units) with an associated &quot;unit card&quot; providing data and tracking damage, etc.  Combat and movement occur in rounds, each round representing about six seconds.  Random results are generated using only twelve-sided dice (d12).  Several dice in different colors are recommended.&#10;&#10;The game assumes two &quot;sides&quot; in each combat, each controlled by one (optionally more) player.  Each player builds their force by purchasing units with points.  One player is the defender; the other player is the attacker.  Setup follows a pre-determined &quot;scenario&quot; (setup guide).&#10;&#10;During each round, initiative is determined.  The losing player moves 1/2 of their units; the winning player moves 1/2 of their units; the losing player move the remainder of their units; the winning player moves the remainder of their units.  Most units can move vertically as well as horizontally.  Units utilize a somewhat simplified method of two-dimensional facing.  Attacks are resolved at the end of a movement, if legal - this means the player that loses initiative will perform the first attacks of the round.&#10;&#10;The game supports a wide range of combatant types, from mecha to armor to monsters.  Many units have special abilities that invoke special rules.  A variety of terrain and status situations may apply.  The game also provides a wide variety of optional rules (including adjustments to 25mm scale).&#10;&#10;Play persists until one player achieves pre-determined victory results or eliminates the other player.&#10;&#10;The game document includes a large number of print-and-play tokens to mark various effects on the battlefield.  Also included are blank, print-and-play unit cards.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"
