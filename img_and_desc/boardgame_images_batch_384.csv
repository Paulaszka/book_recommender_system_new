Players use cards to form math expressions that evaluate to a desired result. It is an educational and fun game for people who want to improve and exercise their arithmetic skills.&#10;&#10;Number of players&#10;1 - 4&#10;&#10;Setup&#10;Deal 5 Poker cards to each player. Place the rest of the Poker cards face-down in a Poker draw pile, the Operator cards face-up in the middle of the table, and the Result cards face-down in a Result draw pile.&#10;&#10;Multi-player Game Play (2-4 players)&#10;During the start of each round, put the top card from the Result draw pile on the table face-up in a Result discard pile. Each player then selects 2 or more Poker cards in his hand such that using these cards and at least 1 Operator card, he is able to form a math expression that evaluates to the number on the face-up Result card. Jokers can represent any number from 1 to 13.&#10;&#10;All players put their selected Poker cards in front of them face-down. If a player thinks he is unable to form any correct math expression with his current hand, he has to place all his 5 Poker cards face-down. Once all players have done this, each player reveals his selected Poker cards and take turns to form the expressions with the Operator cards. If the player forms the expression correctly, then he places his Poker cards face-down in front of him in his Score pile.&#10;&#10;For the player who is unable to form any expression and has placed his 5 Poker cards on the table, he will reveal his cards and other players have a chance to form an expression. Any of the other players may shout &ldquo;Calculae!&rdquo; and then start to form an expression. If the expression is formed correctly, he gets to keep the Poker cards used in his Score pile.&#10;&#10;If a player makes an attempt to form an expression, either using his Poker cards or other player&rsquo;s Poker cards, and is unable to do so or forms an incorrect expression, he will have to discard 3 cards from his Score pile to the Poker discard pile face-up.&#10;&#10;Once all players have verified their expressions formed, they draw Poker hands to fill their hand to 5 and the next round starts where a new Result card is revealed. The new Result card is placed on top of the current Result card.&#10;&#10;Continue playing until either the Poker draw pile or the Result draw pile runs out. The winner is the player with the highest Score.&#10;&#10;Solitaire Game Play (1 player)&#10;All the rules are the same, except that the player has to discard all his cards at the end of a round, whether he has formed an expression or not. Then he draws 5 new Poker cards for the next round. The aim is to score the highest Score.&#10;&#10;"

The Japanese expansion reaches its limit in the archipelago of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The Japanese initial force, the Army of the South Seas, began to expand reducing the boundaries of the Australian defenses from its base in Rabaul, the logistic center of Japanese control in the zone.&#10;The naval-air battle of the Coral Sea was a hard blow for the Japanese force since the Soho, their light aircraft carrier, was sunk, and the amphibious invasion force destined to take Port Moresby had to return to Rabaul without fulfilling their mission. Afterwards the imperial forces tried to take Port Moresby by a ground assault, extending their way along the Solomon Islands creating air bases and observation stations throughout the archipelago.&#10;The Japanese forces were thus threatening naval communications between the United States and Australia.  In response, the Allies reinforced Australia and the New Caledonia zone looking for an opportunity to counterattack and to stop the imperial tide extending through the region. The return to Australia of veteran units from the Middle East allowed the Allies to initiate an offensive in Papua/New Guinea that would last six bloody months and result in the Allied recovery of the enclaves of Buna and Gona on the North coast of New Guinea.&#10;&#10;In the Solomon Islands the North American counterattack began August 8th, 1942 and led to a lasting and bloody campaign through February 1943, with successive attacks and counterattacks of both sides resulting in Guadalcanal Island back in American hands. In addition to the ground forces, the region saw much use of air and naval operations.  Both navies accomplished herculean tasks to support their respective ground forces and supply them.  Their importance was noticeable, so air attacks on navies were numerous, and expensive in lives, planes and ships.  The last of them in this period was the battle of the Sea of Bismarck, which resulted in Allied air supremacy in the region.&#10;The Japanese Imperial navy based on the island of Truk made several raids in the region to support the small naval forces in the South Seas. But eventually the Japanese had to yield the initiative to the allies in the region as they exhausted their resources, fighting on two fronts.  The Allies exhausted the Japanese offensive, and they prepare to take their own offensive.&#10;&#10;The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map with a scale 1:300,000.  It is designed for two players with one running the JAPANESE forces and the other the ALLIED forces. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters.  The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.&#10;&#10;In the beginning of the game the JAPANESE player will take the Initiative and will have to expand throughout the map to secure Victory Points. The ALLIED player is on the defensive, and will have to strength his forces as the game progresses. He will have to take advantage of every opportunity to inflict damage on the advancing Japanese forces.  The island of Guadalcanal will be crucial as the game develops, as are the results of actions in Papua/New Guinea.   &#10;The JAPANESE player must face the historical dilemma of concentrating on taking the Solomon Islands, Papua or both simultaneously.  The ALLIED player will have to be patient and force his opponent to extend himself, by accumulating forces and to committing lethal offensives that put the forces of the Empire of the Rising Sun in check. &#10;Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward.  Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience.  We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.&#10;&#10;"

Prepare to find yourself on the other side of the barricade&hellip; Waves on waves of Goblins try to conquer the city of the humans, through debatable strategies, inconsistent plains and brainless &quot;Epic Death&quot;.&#10;&#10;Goblins is a not collectible card game that melds the bases of the board game with those of the card game.&#10;&#10;Raze the town to the ground and loot everything you can find on your way to leading a mob of stupid Goblins! Other Goblin commanders will collaborate on this task as well. Unfortunately, the idea of collaboration among Goblins is a little bit ambiguous. Dealing with useless subordinates and treacherous allies, the enemy will be the last of your problems.&#10;&#10;Players must destroy the Town and conquer as many Land Cards as possible. Land Cards will award the owner Victory Points. The player with the highest amount of Victory Points wins the match.&#10;&#10;To reach their objective players can rely on Goblin commanders, the alter ego of each player on the battleground; each of these has unique and particular ability to make every game different from the other.&#10;&#10;Unlikely Machines, fearless Goblin heroes and a lot of Action Card make the game always unpredictable.&#10;&#10;The innovative game system is based on &quot; Goblins flipping&quot;. Every choice you make will cause Goblin flip to determine its life or its death. Every Goblin is represented by a disk with two faces: every disk shows a Goblin face on a side and a Goblin skull on the other side.&#10;&#10;The game is exciting every moment also when it isn&rsquo;t your turn. No player will ever be too strong or too weak and the game strategy will change turn after turn suiting better possible the situation.&#10;&#10;Through the system of the exhilarating &quot;Epic Deaths &quot;, your Goblins can commit mass suicide in eccentric ways. The &ldquo;Epic Death&rdquo; can confuse every enemy and allows you to beat him for the dismay. No player is ever out of the game.&#10;&#10;Let the fight for stupidity begin!&#10;&#10;"

The surrounding terrain was flat and open, offering little or no cover.  In such a flat expanse, ridges and rises a mere twenty or thirty yards above sea level give commanding vantage points to their occupants. The height advantage is so slight that one can scarcely appreciate it until actually upon the feature. The 26th Brigade began the difficult task of digging in while reinforcements of artillery, anti-tank guns and machine guns were quickly brought in. Rommel now gave his inevitable response; an all out counterattack to retake this vital ground using threadbare units. Over the next five days, holding this salient would prove extremely tough, with some places changing hands several times. At times the shelling on Tel el Eisa itself made it too hot for either side to occupy.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;&#10;Each turn is 12 hrs, with 400 yard hexes. Units are company and platoons for AFVs.&#10;&#10;After the Australians had nearly ruptured the Italian line on July 10, Rommel diverted many of this available troops to stop the hemorrhage as it threatened his rear area. However, the coastline ridge of hills and the Hill of Jesus (Tel el Eisa) barred their success. Once the Australians had secured their advance and held the hills, Rommel had no choice but to try to seize them back and from the 10th through 15th, this is what he did.&#10;&#10;"

To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the totem by mistake. Whoops!

If a player grabs this Rabbid &ndash; even when someone grabs the totem by mistake &ndash; she can give a card from her face-down stack to the player of her choice. Other cards have players race to create rabbit ears on their head or grab the Rabbid without knocking over the totem. Another special card forces everyone but the active player to close their eyes, while the active player moves the totem to some point on the table within reach of everyone; the other players (with eyes still closed) then race to find the totem first using only their hands.
