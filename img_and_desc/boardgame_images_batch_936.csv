These set cards are then added to with random drawn ones, so each game gets an entertaining level of unpredictability, and the cards will never allow a game to be played the same way twice - even if you you used the same forces, over the same terrain, with the same battle plans, the game would still play-out differently.&#10;&#10;Picking a force is from one of the three army lists in the game, Roman Legions, Barbarians and Parthians, in a familiar way, except the scenario being played adds restrictions to this.

In fact, each player must manage a microbial species, and make it thrive and multiply across the board colonizing habitats that can sustain its metabolism.&#10;Every species is characterized by a metabolism, a way in which it grows and multiplies. Metabolic features are chosen from a set of &quot;plasmids,&quot; cards that are picked by players at the beginning of the game from a starting deck. Plasmids belong to different groups, and choosing different sets of plasmids can yield different gaming experiences.&#10;During their turn, players can choose to spend energy for growth, to move, evolve or attack species living in nearby habitats. Since the goal of the game is to colonize the highest number of habitats, each player can tailor his/her strategy according to the special characteristics of his/her microbe.&#10;A player is declared winning when either is the only one left alone on the board or when he/she has colonized the highest number of habitats.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Confiscating each other&rsquo;s cherished cards was contentious. The diversion cards being played out of turn were priceless double-crossing targeted at who has annoyed you the most and part of the joy and pain of playing with friends or family. I think in football they say there is no such thing as a friendly.&#10;&#10;The single player is a different game altogether. The black guard pack sits there silent and seems to know what you are planning, coming up with cards like it&rsquo;s been tipped of by a snitch. You dread the Inevitable Traitor card making his appearance. But then there is the joy of getting a good run going, tempered with wondering on the turn of each card whether your luck is about to come to an abrupt end. There are 14 escapers waiting in your pack and extension pack for a home run, and the first person to ever get all 14,  I would tell them to go buy a lottery ticket. They will command the luck of the gods.&#10;&#10;"

What's more, those newly purchased cards go straight into your hand and can be used immediately, and any unused cards can be retained in your hand ready for use on your next turn if you're building towards something!&#10;&#10;With numerous &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo; upgrades available, and a decision-tree that multiplies very quickly, ALIENS ATE MY PLANET! rapidly gets you into that all-important mid-game space, giving players a lot of choice and multiple options every turn, transforming it into a razor sharp balancing act: players are knee-deep into the &lsquo;meat and potatoes&rsquo; of the game within a very short space of time, and it won't outstay its welcome at approx. 45-60 mins.&#10;&#10;The game has been designed to carefully balance both the decision-making process and the constant desire to streamline your deck, thus placing players into that classic decision-space of having half a dozen possibilities and a wealth of options available each turn, all of which are positive choices!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
