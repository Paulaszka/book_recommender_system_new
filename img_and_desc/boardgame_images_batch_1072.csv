The objective is to transform your neighborhood from a late-stage capitalist hellscape into a slacker Marxist utopia.&#10;&#10;The game is turn-based.  At the beginning of every round new Narratives and Aktions are drawn and voted on, and the police and the Medic will take their turns. There are no discreet game stages, but the early game will likely be focused mainly on looting and burning, which builds up your characters and the POZ.  The Police are quite tough, and players are unlikely to be able to defeat them early on.&#10;&#10;When space for building has been cleared out and players have amassed a large enough arsenal, it will be time to bring the fight to the Man.  The police work on a simple AI (similar to Space Hulk).  They will be relatively passive early on but their aggressiveness will increase as the POZ grows.&#10;&#10;POZ is semi-cooperative, and there are two conditions for winning:&#10;&#10;a) The POZ must be built up, the police must be defeated, and the courthouse must be occupied.  This is a group effort which benefits all players.&#10;&#10;b) Once the courthouse is occupied, however, only the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Whoever gets an odd number of spots skips fate. Whoever has an even number of spots - he draws the &quot;Fate&quot; card for himself and is used to write it.

To do this, you draw cards with resources and draw them into your plan. You have to be careful not to miscalculate because the dwarves cleverly build all kinds of useful things for their village from each resource during the production phases. For every gold coin a new dwarf comes to the village, for every stone a wall is built, for every combination of wood, stone and beer a tavern is built, and so on. Since the forest clearing available to you as a building site is not the largest, you must plan well in advance so that there is enough room for everything in your dwarf village. Of course, the wishes of the inhabitants must also be taken into account, so there is a lot to plan for your own dwarf village.&#10;&#10;"

Your skill is tested in both of these exciting versions, because if the penguin falls, the game is over!&#10;&#10;1.Version: Ice wall The game starts when the ice wall is set up and the penguin is in position. You can play this game with 2-4 people. The players take turns to carefully pick an ice block out of the wall with the small hammer (ice pick). Players always have to keep an eye on the little penguin, because if it falls off the wall, the game is over! The player who makes the penguin fall off loses the game.&#10;&#10;2.Version: Ice tower Players now take turns to pull out a block of ice from the tower with their hands. The same applies here: If the penguin falls, the game is over and the player who caused it loses the game!&#10;&#10;"

The game is based on the Hostile Environment world, but players may use whatever modern or futuristic miniatures they have from Vietnam, Cold War or Science Fiction eras.&#10;&#10;Hostile Environment uses a die-pull initiative system to keep players on their toes. Better soldiers get greater odds of more activations, but lesser soldiers are allowed more numbers to keep fights balanced.&#10;&#10;Each miniature represents a single unit ranging in skill from green to elite. There are over 15 different weapon types and 6+ armor types from modern weapons and armor to alt-future tech.&#10;&#10;Most matches take about 90 minutes using at most two dozen miniatures.&#10;&#10;H.E.: Special Forces can be played solo, using the Hostile Tactical AI card deck (sold separately).&#10;&#10;2050, the world has entered total chaos.
