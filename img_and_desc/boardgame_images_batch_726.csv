The hero cards are offered in 3 different languages: English, German and Dutch. The playing cards are language independant and are valued 0 to 7. The cards with value 3 and 4 in each suit are magical spells. Each suit also has one card marked as a potion, the value being different in each suit. These special cards offer special gameplay effects, depending on which hero is chosen in a round. The other playing cards show typical dungeon inhabitants. These become relevant with a few heroes that are in the game.&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds to accumulate the most gold and the player who ends up with the most gold wins the game. There are 3 sets of 5 unique heroes and each game a set of 5 heroes is chosen to play with. Every round one of the players acts as the active player and has to choose one of 5 available heroes. Each hero changes the game and describes how gold is earned. All the other players have to cooperate and try to stop the active player from reaching this goal.&#10;&#10;The active player chooses the hero to play with after the playing cards are dealt. In a 4 player game each player receives 7 cards. The remaining 4 cards are set aside. After the active player has chosen the hero for the round, that player may exchange up to 4 cards from hand with the remaining cards. In a 2 and 3 player game each player is dealt 9 cards and 5 cards are set aside and available for exchanging.&#10;&#10;Each hero determines the goal for the active player how gold can be earned. This can be a scaling amount of gold. For example if a player chooses the Barbarian gold is earned for every collected trick and potion card above a certain threshold. Some heroes offer a fixed amount of gold. For example, if a player chooses the Assassin, 4 gold is earned if the active player wins the final trick of the round. When the active player did not manage to earn any gold, all other players are rewarded for their good cooperation by earning 1 gold each. Some heroes change the game in other ways, for example playing cards without revealing them or making use of the set aside cards during a round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. The first played card of a trick determines the suit that is asked. Other players must follow suit, if they can. In general the player who played highest card of the suit that is requested, wins the trick. Some heroes add trump cards that round, this can be a suit, one of the special cards (magical spells, potions) or even a specific number. If one or more trump cards is played in a trick, the highest trump wins the trick. Each suit is ranked (1 to 4), if multiple trump cards of the same value are played (e.g. multiple 4's with a hero in play that makes them trump), the higher ranked suit wins the trick.&#10;&#10;The three sets of five heroes each offer a range of options for players. Starting players are recommended to play with set A first. Sets B and C offering more tricky heroes to play with. Besides these three unique set of hero options, the game also suggests a few variants to increase variability. Instead of playing 2 rounds per player the 'Adventurer's Guild' variant forces players to play once with each of the five heroes that game as an active player. Another variant, 'Random Dungeon', shuffles all the 15 heroes together and the active player is offered 1 hero at random to choose to play with. Up to two times this hero can be refused an a new hero is revealed.&#10;&#10;"

The next player clockwise will then read a question.&#10;&#10;6.

The rules say to place all the letters in a box from which players draw blind.&#10;&#10;In the Game of Words, players draw one tile at a time. The first two players put their letters on the centre of the table, forming a pool. Each turn thereafter, a player tries to use the letter in his hand to form a word from the letters in the pool. If he succeeds, the word is placed in front of him. Players may use their letters to add to another word to create a new, longer one, and &quot;capture&quot; that word from another player. They also may add their letter to one of their own words. Letters in a word may be rearranged. Unplayable letters are added to the pool. Players draw a new tile to end their turn. The player with the most words at game end wins.&#10;&#10;In the Game of Sentences, players draw two tiles per turn and again try to form words. Words of only one or two letters are allowed, as are proper names, place names and possessives. The winner is the first to use all of his words to form an intelligible sentence of an agreed length. The rules suggest that five to 10 words forms a pleasant game.&#10;&#10;The rulebook also contains rules for two more games, The Block Game of Words (where letters are face up and players can choose) and The Game of Alphabets (where each player thinks of a word, gathers the necessary letters and passes them to his neighbor, who then must try to figure out what word those letters spell).&#10;&#10;"

They must discard a card from their hand every turn. All cards consume energy, and players must decide how to allocate energy use since stronger and more versatile cards use more energy. Cards can be played facedown and turned face-up at any time. When turned facedown to face-up, card effects immediately take place, giving the player the element of surprise.

Isolated skirmishes evolved into the War of 2620, and the War Machines Company profited by selling dangerous machines and technologies to wounded societies. Both of the multinational governments, in an attempt to preserve their own residents, purchased weapons faster than they could afford to spend money. Eventually, both multinational governments ran out of money and started purchasing the weapons with food, water, land, and sources of energy.

The German player is mainly on the offensive, attempting to win by seizing key areas on map faster than was done historically. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires he prosecute almost continuous counteroffensives throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Game play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their invasion on 22 June and ends on 1 September of the same year. The main thrust of the design is to test Guderian's oft-repeated claim he could've led Army Group Center into Moscow during that time, had he only been allowed by Hitler to run a true blitzkrieg.&#10;&#10;The game may end sooner than the historic termination time, if the German player is able to do significantly better than his historic counterpart by advancing so quickly he causes the overall political, social, economic and military collapse of the Soviet Union. Alternatively, if the German player doesn't do well enough soon enough, he may lose the game in that it's then assumed Hitler loses faith in the idea of taking Moscow and instead turns AGC's panzers south to Kiev, just as occurred historically.&#10;&#10;Each hexagon on the map represents 16 miles (26 km) from side to opposite side.

This Fable Game will remain just as playable on the 20th play as it was on the first plays of the game.&#10;&#10;Fabled Fruit FAQ&#10;&#10;"

Its mechanics are board-and-card driven with some dice-influenced results; the game flow is controlled by action and reaction cards, dice rolling, hand management, and area influence. A quirky, humorous tone keeps the mood light, despite the deep gameplay.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over the final eight weeks of the campaign and concludes with the assignment of electoral votes on Election Night. Each player chooses a candidate they are trying to propel to victory. Play as one of the leading lights of the 2016 campaign, or bring back a proven winner! Some candidates are better at speaking, some bring more skill at fundraising, some are from swing states, and others are simply rich.&#10;&#10;Each week is divided into two turns, one for each player, and is affected by an environment card that may temporarily alter the cost or effect of your actions. You&rsquo;ll begin with five action cards, representing various things you can do during that week&rsquo;s campaign, such as uncover a scandal, criticize Cuba, collect an endorsement, or even start a war. You&rsquo;ll also start with five state cards, which determine where you can play your action cards. Each turn gives you the opportunity to draw or purchase new and more powerful action cards, some of which can be combined to extraordinary effect.&#10;&#10;Each week you&rsquo;ll spend time and energy visiting swing states, building up influence points that hopefully will lead to winning that state on election night. If you build up enough influence, you&rsquo;ll get momentum in that state, which will make it harder for your opponent to come back&mdash;but be careful; spend too much time in any one place and they&rsquo;ll start to get sick of you.&#10;&#10;Have you sold out to major donors to finance your campaign? Of course you have! This gives you money, which you can spend on state or national advertising. Again, this can give you momentum, but you risk overexposure.&#10;&#10;You can do all sorts of things in Race to the White House by playing Action Cards. You can come out against the Keystone XL pipeline (if you&rsquo;re a Democrat) or promise more mining permits (if you&rsquo;re a Republican). If your party is in office, you can start a war, or respond to a major natural disaster&mdash;but be careful; either one can backfire badly, and your opponent might have an October Surprise ready. You can cheer for a swing state&rsquo;s baseball team in the World Series, or you can stick your opponent with bad weather. You can uncover a scandal in state government that puts a safe state in play, or you can send hecklers into your opponent&rsquo;s rallies that neutralizes their effects. It feels just as crazy, exciting, and dirty as an actual campaign!&#10;&#10;Over the course of eight weeks, you&rsquo;ll build up a strong position in some swing states, and if you&rsquo;ve been smart about it, you&rsquo;ll have managed to play defense and prevent your opponent from doing the same. But you never really know, do you? When election night rolls around, you&rsquo;ll be on the edge of your seat waiting for the networks to call the states in the order that their polls close. Some states will be easy, but others will be too close to call, potentially until early in the morning. If you&rsquo;re behind, do you concede and save some victory points? Or do you hang on until the bitter end? It&rsquo;s all up to you&hellip; in Race to the White House!&#10;&#10;"

During this period, there are no all-big-gun battleships, aircraft, gun directors, or radios. In the 1890s, 1,500 yards was considered effective range, and 3,000 yards was long range. If you've played other naval games, you'll have to get in real close if you want to hit.&#10;&#10;Dawn of the Battleship gives the player a taste of what it was like to command a ship or formation during a late 19th/early 20th century sea battle. A player with little or no experience in naval combat can quickly learn the basic principles of naval warfare, and use them in the game to fight and win. Tactics that worked in history will work in this game.&#10;&#10;It can not only to recreate famous naval engagements such as the battles of Manila Bay and Santiago de Cuba, but also the myriad of &ldquo;almost&rdquo; battles between the rapidly growing fleets of Europe, Japan, and America.&#10;&#10;If you have played other Admiralty Trilogy games, this one uses the same terms and game system as the others (Harpoon, Command at Sea, and Fear God &amp; Dread Nought). That makes it easy to learn and you know it will be accurate.&#10;&#10;"

The board has a track of 100 circles starting at Washington and ending in victory at Richmond. The game requires a 1-8 spinner, and players use toy soldiers as tokens.&#10;&#10;Each circle is marked with a battle, place, person or unit that took part in the Civil War. Some spaces are setbacks (Bull Run at 20 sends a player back to Washington), while the Andersonville and Libbey prison spaces traps a player until another player reaches a prisoner exchange space.&#10;&#10;The back of the board both describes the game and shows how it was sold.
