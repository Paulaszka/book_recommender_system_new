It is set in another dimension that is known as Black Sun, located somewhere in an alternate jungles of Cambodia in the year 1968. The rules are designed to give you an authentic feel for warfare in the Viet Nam War and could certainly be used for this purpose. However, the game also includes some fantastic events from the alternate dimension of the Black Sun. These rules include unpredictable events &ndash; sudden rushes, explosions, ambushes, and malfunctioning weapons along with more far flung environmental and strange atmospheric manifestations &ndash; that will challenge your strategy and tactics as a tabletop general. The terrain can be as elaborate or as simple as you like; but the game is best played with lots of cover (jungle, trees, jungle, rocks, downed helicopters, ancient buildings and yet more jungle). The playing area can represent anything from an ancient city to an alien jungle canopy to a Bug-infested tunnel complex! &#10;Each player controls a Force about the size of a small squad (6-15 models). Some Forces may involve more models than others since they consist either of less skilled troops (like NVA militia or poorly armed and trained conscripts) or weird alien Fury Bugs whose strength lies in their overwhelming numbers. As players become more experienced, they can control larger numbers of troops as well as vehicles and incorporate more advanced rules for Viet Nam era warfare. At its most basic size (squad level), a game of Black Sun should take an hour or less to play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;"

The catch: Some (or sometimes none) of the Believers are left out, making them Outsiders. Each Believer then submits what they recall of the Rite, such as the chants, the time of day, the food for the feast, or even the special shapes, smells, or colors. Once each Believer has helped remember the Rite, an accusation occurs: Can each Believer point out an Outsider? Can the Outsiders fake their way through it and guess the topic? In the end, only the most confident, creative, and devout among the Believers will be declared the winner and Master of Ceremonies of the Sacred Rites.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Neither the publisher nor the designer is indicated, but the game comes in an envelope saying &quot;Enclosed: Your Free Animal Triva Game&quot;, so one might imagine that it was a promotional item or was given away for free with some product or service.&#10;There are 30 cardboard rectangles with numbers from 1 to 30, and another 30 cardboard rectangles in 6 different groups (indicated by pictures and words): birds, insects, primates, fish, mammals, and reptiles (however, the reptile rectangles have a picture of a frog on them). One of each of these 6 groups has a stars, in addition to the pictures and the names of the groups.&#10;The two different types of squares (numbers and animals) are put into two different containers. Players (presumably without looking) take one rectangle from each container, and this determines which question (from the question sheet) they have to answer. For example, if a player drew 6 and primates, he would have to answer the question &quot;True or False: Lemurs and lorises have huge eyes so they can see well at night&quot;. (The correct answer here is &quot;true&quot;). Most correct answers give the player 5 points, but if a starred rectangle was drawn,  a correct answer gives 10 points.&#10;The game can last a chosen period of time (in which case whoever has amassed the highest total wins) or until a set target of points is reached (in which case whoever has reached that target wins).&#10;&#10;"

You can buy new tools from the cargo ship to make your search more successful and to have the most sensational publication at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each round players choose from their movement tokens the one which has a number showing how far they want to move. You cannot reuse it until you run out of the other movement tokens. You can move your ship forward or backwards on the river as far as the selected movement token shows.&#10;&#10;If your ship lands on a tile with a buoy, take a look at the card at the top of the discovery deck. If the card shows a tool that you own, you are lucky! Keep the card. On the other side of the card, you can see your new discovery and the number of victory points/score. The player with the highest number of victory points at the end wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as &quot;The Most Select of Places&quot; (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.&#10;&#10;Join ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.&#10;&#10;The game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.&#10;&#10;As you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice &mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section &mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.&#10;&#10;When you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!&#10;&#10;Two scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.&#10;&#10;"
