Following the Resident Evil 2 (2019) and Resident Evil 3(2021) board games, Resident Evil: The Board Game (2023) brings the sinister Spencer Mansion to the tabletop in a terrifying open world campaign. Based on the 2002 remake of the original Resident Evil video game, Resident Evil: The Board Game is a cooperative survival horror board game for 1-4 players.&#10;&#10;Built on the survival horror engine of the previous two board games, Resident Evil: The Board Game introduces a slew of new and updated mechanics to keep you on your toes. Solve ingenious new puzzles to unlock doors, build the mansion map as you explore, send non-player characters on valuable missions, and more. Setup is swift because each scenario begins with just a few tiles. As you explore and open doors, you&rsquo;ll build out the map, opening new pathways and discovering useful items&hellip; and deadly enemies.&#10;&#10;Resident Evil: The Board Game is a campaign game playable over 27 hours, where every decision counts and has far-reaching consequences. Every resource must be managed, every bullet counted. Fighting isn&rsquo;t the only way to survive. You&rsquo;ll have to decide when to attack and when to flee. But you won&rsquo;t always get a choice! As your campaign goes on, the mansion will evolve and the danger level will rise. The tension and encounter decks will change, adding mysterious new cards and altering the effects of old cards to make them even more dangerous. But effects don&rsquo;t just happen over time. Tension cards can change enemy behaviours at any moment, making them more lethal from one turn to the next.&#10;&#10;Short on time? Each Resident Evil: The Board Game scenario is also playable as a 60-90 minute one-shot, for bite-sized nightmare sessions.&#10;&#10;In the darkness lie your fears. Can you fight them and survive?&#10;&#10;"

Each faction has its own role to play in the game and its own method of earning victory points based on its distinct goals.&#10;&#10;In this game, the British are not a playable faction, but a non-player force that players will have to respond to, either by fighting against colonial forces, or working with them to oppose the other players.&#10;&#10;Designer note: Tyranny of Blood is about a hierarchical system that has oppressed people throughout history and has lingering effects that continue to cause suffering today. The game is meant as a condemnation of the system and a method of understanding it, not an endorsement or celebration.
