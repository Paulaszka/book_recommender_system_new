A ruler can also be useful if you want. You are not the coach, but a spectator which attends the game and watches its development and the stats accumulating in a very realistic manner.&#10;There is a BASIC GAME, very simple and fast to play, and an ADVANCED GAME, which allows you to choose the statistical detail you desire, by giving you the possibility to keep track of minutes played by each player, blocks, steals, disqualifications, team possessions and the chance to use special playoffs rules. You should have more time to play if you desire more detail, but after learning the very simple mechanism, you will be able to play an entire game in about 30 minutes while keeping every kind of individual stats. Regular Season Basketball is ideal to replay a whole season, since actual games played by each player are also recreated by consulting the &ldquo;Rest Chart&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. So, no boring dice rolls before the game just to determine which player will play, no setup time involved; players will populate the scoresheet as soon as they are called in action by the chart. Also do not ask about how to resolve the opening tip-off. This is a segment by segment game, not a possessions game.&#10;&#10;Every single game is played through several segments, each one representing three minutes of real play. In each segment, both teams roll two dice once to determine scores and stats; after four segments a quarter of 12 minutes will be over. To complete an NBA game, 16 dice rolls are required by each team. For an NCAA game the time scale is different with each die roll representing four minutes and 10 total rolls necessary to complete a game. When a tie game occurs, an overtime is played by rolling the dice once more for each team, this being the only case in which a segment represents five minutes instead of three.&#10;&#10;You will never lose the feeling of the game because alternating the dice rolls between the two teams you have the score for each three minutes of play, catching the drama of a close game, realizing &quot;garbage time&quot; situations, big come-backs and the influence of the home court advantage very strong specially in the final minutes of a game.&#10;&#10;"

As with most old games the exact rules passed on over time are not exactly clear. Variants described here are usually taken from Internet or book sources mentioned or as found, played and explained by word of mouth on mediaeval LARP conventions. The game is assumed to be derived from or match the family of Alquerque.&#10;&#10;Mentioned web sites or references claim Qero to be an ancient mediaeval game of unknown source. Thus on the one hand unfortunately no game author can be listed and on the other hand it should not have any legal restrictions, trademarks, patents, or utility patterns in place. The game is in the public domain.&#10;&#10;Mostly Qero is played without any specific line patterns shown on board (in contrast to Alquerque). If a line pattern is shown on the board players may agree on performing moves on each direction of lines shown by the pattern only. Thus moves are allowed along the lines only. Otherwise rules might allow horizontal and vertical moves only. By agreement diagonal moves in any direction could be performed as well. Although the later seems to be quite uncommon.&#10;&#10;Variant 1: Started on an empty board the players set up all their pieces first. Players' pieces are facing up their own symbol or color. The pieces are placed onto the remaining free positions of the board in alternating game play. Thus if no player achieved a winning situation during this board set up phase then the first player ends up with 13 gaming pieces set and the second player set 12 gaming pieces of own color.&#10;&#10;Up to that point it is a typical 5-in-a-row variant like tic-tac-toe, Renju, Pente, or Go-Moku without any kind of capturing. After this set up phase game play changes although the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your pieces. After set up phase take a piece of your color off the chosen edge position and place it back on the board shifting the other pieces filling up the newly formed gap (from the end of an incomplete row or column of your choice). Like in Quixo... Probably just gut feeling: There seem to be less draw situations in direct comparison to Quixo (assumed experienced players really try to achieve winning the game).&#10;&#10;In this Qero variant the amount of pieces on board controlled by the player is fixed after the initial set up phase. So you could simply use some two sided game pieces (Othello/Reversi) or even simple pawns (e.g. 13 white plus 12 black pawns w/ white starting the game) and start playing on any 5 times 5 board as well.&#10;&#10;Variant 2: Started on an empty board the players set up all their pieces first. Players' pieces are facing up their own symbol or color. The pieces are placed onto the remaining free positions of the board in alternating game play. Each player sets up 12 pieces of own color if no player achieved a winning situation during this board set up phase. One board position remains empty.&#10;&#10;Up to that point it is a typical 5-in-a-row variant, too. There is no kind of capturing opponent's gaming pieces. After this set up phase game play changes although the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your own pieces. The game continues and a player's turn consists in chosing any type of gaming piece may it be own or opponent's from the edge positioned in direct straight line towards the board position left empty. From the chosen board position push all pieces in between in straight line so the chosen position is the new empty position.&#10;&#10;Variant 3: At start of game on all but one board position a die is placed with none symbol facing or a symbol indicating a neutral field not owned by any player. The dice has to show various faces (one with a number or symbol for the first player, another for the second player and finally one for indicating neutral positions). Compared to previous variants there is no set up phase.&#10;&#10;A player's turn consists in selecting a die showing an empty or own symbol from the edge. If this die is showing an empty face it turns to show the face with the player's symbol now. The selected die has to be positioned in direct straight line towards the board position left empty. Otherwise it can not be selected. From the chosen board position push all pieces in between in straight line so the chosen position is the new empty position. Again the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your own pieces.&#10;&#10;Obviously a fourth variant could be introduced similiar to the one before allowing to chose any (not just own or empty) die from the edge instead.&#10;&#10;Variant 2 is most-likely targeted and described in German in &quot;Allerley Spielerey - Spielen wie im Mittelalter&quot;, Gisela Muhr and Eleonore Sieck, ISBN 978-3-939722-38-0, p.118, 2011, published by Regionalia. The book includes only an abstract description how the authors interprete to push a chosen stone from the edge (is it allowed to use own color only or could the opponent's color be chosen as well?) to the empty position exactly.&#10;&#10;"

The game plays much like the pen and paper game boxes. Each turn the player draws one &quot;star&quot; token from the supplied cloth bag (Affectionately known as the &quot;nebula&quot; and places it into an empty region of &quot;space&quot; on the the board.&#10;&#10;Once a certain threshold number of adjacent stars is reached the whole zone collapses into a black hole and the player who played the star captures all of the stars in the collapsed zone before playing another star. With more than two players the game becomes mind-bogglingly difficult to think more than one move ahead making the tactics almost impossible to work out.&#10;&#10;The game ships with two play modes, a basic mode in which all stars score the same and a more complicated advanced game where players compete to not only capture the most stars but the highest scoring ones as well. The advanced game also introduces gravity charges that allow players to remove a black hole from the board if stuck.&#10;&#10;All in all a great little time waster that will continue to be played for years to come.&#10;&#10;"

All troops must participate on an attack.&#10;&#10;Each troop has a power that counts both for attack and defense. Bases always have a power of 4. To destroy a base one must destroy all its troops first. The goal is to destroy the opponent's Palace that sits behind his territories and has a power of 10. The Palace can only be attacked if at least one of the territories has no bases on it.&#10;&#10;"
