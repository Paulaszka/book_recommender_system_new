1883,,"Cataphract is defined as a heavily armored cavalryman modelled either on the Sarmatians (cataphractarius) or the Persians (clibanarius). He was the ultimate mounted armored warrior of the ancient world, trained in both shock and missile combat.&#10;&#10;Cataphract portrays the development of the art of war wrought by the early Byzantine Empire, during the reign of Emperor Justinian, under his great Generals, Belisarius and Narses. During this period the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, for a brief period of time, re-captured a large portion of what was formerly the Western Roman Empire. Although successful in its attempts to reconquer Italy and North Africa, the Byzantine Empire's resources were insufficient to hold on to its gains.&#10;&#10;Cataphract covers all the major battles that defined this Early Medieval era. To place these battles in their proper historical context, the Campaign Game, Justinian, is enclosed, which covers the quest to reconquer the Roman Empire under one ruler.&#10;&#10;Thus, Cataphract contains the decisive battles of the era; a Campaign Game; plus a special bonus Viking raid scenario; and the land/naval leaders for an upcoming series of C3i Magazine Modules covering the Peloponnesian War. The second edition of Cataphract add to the six Early Medieval battles of the first edition, the Ancient Battles of the Utus River (447 CE) and the Catalaunian Fields (451 CE) from the original Attila: Scourge of God Module.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The only commodity left is ... camels!&#10;The Future. Camels. Space Bucks. You.&quot;&#10;&#10;A dangerous combination. Can you assemble the most impressive herd of camels?&#10;It's the future, and camels are more valuable than gold or any other commodity for that matter. You've got money to burn and camels to buy in this quick bidding game. While quantity is important, it's camel quality that really counts. Will you put your money into the single-hump Arabian or Saharan Dromedary? Or do you prefer the more exotic two-humped Bactrian? Such is the nail biting excitement.&#10;All the other animals have died and all you can buy are camels. There are three types and they come in groups of one to four. The cards are then numbered 1 to 9, the higher the number, the more camels. Your camels are worth more if you have the largest herd (most cards of a type), a train (sequence of three or more) or a 'Big Three' (three cards of the same number). All in all it's difficult to know how much cards are worth - but that's what makes for a good bidding game.&#10;&#10;Bidding is just one round, so the last bidder has a big advantage. The only way to counter this is by 'Spitting' . You play your spit token and get an extra bid after the last bid. You can only do this once. Once all the spit tokens are played, you're left calculating how much money players have got left . The player purchasing the last card, bids first in the next round. This player enjoys the title of Space Merchant&#10;The winner is the person who has the most money when the game ends!&#10;&#10;"

To establish control over a department, a player must spend kudos (the game's currency) and he or she must outspend other players with similar interests.  Each player also has a deck of cards that can help them to establish control, or to hinder others from doing so.

While the game retained some of the features of the original game, it also removed a number of abilities and interactions deemed too confusing for the novice player.  Though a number of the cards in portal were direct counterparts to cards in the regular-run of Magic: the Gathering, gone were named abilities like Trample, Banding, -walk (though Three Kingdoms did add the ability &quot;Horsemanship&quot;, which is almost but not quite flying).  Additionally, the game cut back on cards that could be played on another player's turn (i.e. instants and interrupts), leading to a greater focus on creatures and not spell interactions to achieve victory.&#10;&#10;Portal cards are recognizable from core and expansion sets of Magic: the Gathering by the expansion symbol, as well as a bolder and larger font in the text box, and symbols next to the attack and defense numbers of creatures.&#10;&#10;Portal was printed in three editions:&#10;&#10;     Portal&#10;     Portal Second Age&#10;     Portal Three Kingdoms (with an Eastern/Chinese theme)&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.&#10;&#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).&#10;&#10;It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.&#10;&#10;"

Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly II.)&#10;&#10;The &quot;Bust~the~Trust!&quot; Game&#10;&#10;The basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three &quot;accusation circles&quot; respectively. &quot;Accusing&quot; is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the &quot;Budget-Commissioner&quot;; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.&#10;&#10;Variant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.&#10;&#10;Anspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.&#10;&#10;Anti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as &quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; was published as &quot;Choice&quot; whilst the company was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;.  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?&#10;&#10;"

Equipment can be lost in encounters but may be recovered in specific locations.&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s standout feature is its transforming game board: composed of six hinged panels, the board includes magical whirlpools that, when entered, cause sections of the board to unfold, revealing new realms and routes. This innovative mechanic creates a dynamic, ever-shifting world and introduces the possibility of leaving other players stranded when the board folds back.&#10;&#10;Key to the Kingdom (1990) is a standalone design distinct from the 2022 reimplementation, though both share the core themes of exploration, adventure, and whimsical danger.&#10;&#10;"

It is now out-of-print.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three stages. In the first stage you have to take the map pieces from the other players.&#10;&#10;Second stage: When you have all the pieces, you know where the treasure is located (since you would know which part Captain Kidd has swallowed = missing) and you can rush away to the hidden place to get the treasure chest.&#10;&#10;In the third and last stage, you have to run away, either with the raft or with one of the rowing boats the player arrived with. All the time the other player can get the map pieces or the chest from you, so you need to be quick and careful.&#10;&#10;Of course the pirates may duel with pistols and shoot with the cannon - placed in the centre of the island - at each other!&#10;&#10;The game were sold with fine metal (tin) playing pieces: six pirates, a raft, a cannon and, of course, the treasure chest (fitted with a steel ring so it could be hung on the pirate playing piece representing who had custody of the treasure!).&#10;&#10;"

It's done when 2 allies from different armies meet at an alliance field, where 'Star Wars' is stated. Throwing 4 dices and adding attack value, they must get at least 22. Enemies cannot go trough the opened gate.&#10;&#10;The combat system is simple, by adding attack values and defence values of each character to the dice throws. Regardless who attacked, the player who got smaller number, loses the character. The lost character can be conquered back if ventured in the enemy base and both characters are moved back to own base.&#10;&#10;When character reaches Queen Amidala, player takes control of it and tries to move it back to allied base.

1958,,"This game is a geopolitical simulation of local influence in the Middle East on the flow of oil supplies to the rest of the world.&#10;&#10;The map shows 8 fictitious Middle Eastern oil producing countries, one of which controls the Canal that links both ocean sides. If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.&#10;&#10;You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto &quot;?&quot; spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.&#10;&#10;To survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue. Early bold attacks, even combined with the right incident card, are not recommended: a co-operative approach to the game maximises revenue to offset the many accidents which can happen in the game.&#10;&#10;From the Waddington ad for the game dated 1972:&#10;&#10;A political strategy game&#10;&quot;In the modern world of international diplomacy and intrigue, there are many stakes in this game of economic survival.

Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;&#10;&#10;Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.&#10;&#10;The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.&#10;&#10;Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.&#10;&#10;There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.&#10;&#10;The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.&#10;&#10;The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.&#10;&#10;Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.&#10;&#10;Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.&#10;&#10;The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.&#10;&#10;A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.&#10;&#10;The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.&#10;&#10;Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.&#10;&#10;from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat&quot;&#10;&#10;"

1969,,"Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series later acquired by Avalon Hill&#10;&#10;From the box:&#10; &quot;POINT OF LAW is an exciting game of involvement for all players. You are the judge and jury! You decide which argument is most convincing. Many an interesting discussion -- and an occasional laugh or two -- takes place as players use logic and intuition in reaching their decisions.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will your decisions be just? Will you declare the 'Feral Financier' a public nuisance? How will you rule in the case of the IRS against the 'Self-Rising Sinner'? Can the 'Mixed-Up Marriage' be annulled?

1971,,"In Bump: the Sneaky Numbers Game, players are given a hand of cards, and play those to a common pile, hoping to bring the count to one of several target numbers.  Going over (or under with a negative card) the target number costs money, but hitting it dead on wins $2,000.  Money can also be claimed by bumping other players.  First to win $10,000 wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

1979,,"Played with a giant deck of 150 cards numbered 1-10 and 18 joker cards.&#10;Players have individual card stacks of which only the top card is open. The goal of the game is to get rid of one's entire stack first. This is achieved by putting cards down on stacks in the middle of the table. Those stacks have to be in numerical order, starting with 1 and finishing with 10 (there are Joker cards to fill gaps). The players also have their own individual stacks on which they can put open cards for later use.&#10;&#10;Republished by Amigo in 2009 under the name Da Capo, with only 15 Jokers included (and with a new design).&#10;&#10;"

1983,,"You visit frontier towns as you go around the outer track, and you can buy up parts of them (bank, saloon, etc.) to secure revenue.  Whenever you visit the Bank, you have the option of holding it up, in which case the game switches to a different mode, which uses the inside of the board.  This shows a map of the Far West --you are now an outlaw on that map, running for the border.  Those of the other players that want to are also put on the map as bounty hunters.  Once the chase is resolved --one way or another-- the pieces return to the outer track.&#10;&#10;"

1985,,"Overturn is a two-player word game that blends vocabulary skills with strategic play, reminiscent of Othello but with a linguistic twist. Players take turns forming words by placing colored rings over letters on a modular board. If a player uses a letter already claimed by the opponent, they can flip the ring to their own color, effectively &quot;overturning&quot; control of that space. The game continues until all letters are used or no more words can be formed, and the player with the most rings in their color wins.&#10;&#10;1993 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;"

1987,,"In this highly abstract strategic wargame, you are trying to conquer China by being the first to occupy fifteen provinces at the completion of a complete round of play (all players having had an equal number of turns).  Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.&#10;&#10;You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.&#10;&#10;A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.&#10;&#10;The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.&#10;&#10;"

1989,,"This game was published in the wake of the best-selling success of Dr. Peter's book &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; (oft-quoted as &quot;In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his or her level of incompetence&quot;). In it, the players, employees of a huge corporation, compete to avoid promotion and remain competent (by taking more &quot;right&quot; decisions than &quot;wrong&quot; ones). At the same time, each tries to force the others into promotion or into &quot;deadwood&quot; status (which happens by accumulating enough wrong decisions and being found out). The last player still alive and competent is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published by Skor-Mor in 1973, but the 1981 AH edition is much easier to find.&#10;&#10;Skor-Mor published 3D puzzles and games in clear plastic such as Chess in the Third Dimension and a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe called Trinary. It disappeared in the early 1980s.&#10;&#10;A related game, theme-wise, is AH's Bureaucracy.&#10;&#10;"

1993,,"The sub-title for Troke is &quot;Castle Checkers&quot;.&#10;&#10;Abstract strategy game where players move three different kinds of pieces (tower, wall, and moat) across a board diagonally forward, straight ahead or sideways, but never backwards.  In some versions of the game, points are scored for capturing opponent's pieces and by forming complete &quot;castles&quot; (a tower, wall, and moat) on the player's goal line.  Otherwise it is a race to see who can get all their pieces to goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves.  You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent&rsquo;s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.&#10;&#10;"
