It belongs to the Morris family. Like other games from that family, its origins date back to antiquity. The game is played by nomadic shepherds and city dwellers where a class of professional players has emerged.&#10;&#10;Shax is played on the same board as Nine Men's Morris, but with twelve pieces for each player. Play consists of two phases: the setup phase and the movement phase. In the setup phase, players take turns putting one piece on the board. Unlike in Nine Men's Morris, no pieces are removed when a jare (three-in-a-row, mill, literally: &quot;cut&quot;) is formed during the setup. It is only noted who formed the first jare.&#10;&#10;In the movement phase, the player who formed the first jare moves first (if no jare was formed in the setup phase, the second player starts). He does so by removing one arbitrary piece of the opponent in order to create space for movement. The opponent does the same. Then players take turns moving their stones as in the other Morris games.&#10;&#10;If a jare is formed in the movement phase, the player removes a piece of the opponent. Note that - again unlike other Morris games - pieces in a jare are never protected against capture. Another important difference is that blocking does not constitute a win. If a player is locked in, he may demand that the opponent moves his stones until the blockade is removed. No advantage may be taken from these extra moves. In particular, if a jare is formed during these moves, then no capture is performed. There is no &quot;flying phase&quot; when a player is reduced to three pieces or less. The player who loses all his pieces loses the game.&#10;&#10;Numerous references to Shax exist in proverbs and Somalian literature. Favorable patterns of stones have got their own names.&#10;&#10;"

The game consists of several &quot;trials&quot; that take place. There is a narrator who is the judge of these trials. He runs the trials but must remain impartial. Every trial ends either with everyone going to sleep (mistrial) or with an execution. The Innocents are trying to convict the Guilty criminals while the criminals are trying to remain hidden and get Innocents executed. Also, one or two of the Guilty criminals are murderers who kill a citizen after every trial while everyone sleeps.&#10;&#10;The game centers on someone who is the Detective trying to hunt down all of the Guilty before they murder everyone. If the Guilty try to kill the Detective, the final round of the game commences. The citizens may still vote to convict criminals, but the Detective has his trusty sidearm and can shoot citizens at will! But he must be careful, if he kills any Innocent player the game is over and the guilty win! There are also several roles to help the Innocent (heroes, lawyers, vigilantes...etc.) and the Guilty (serial killers, pyromaniacs, dirty cops...etc.). All roles are hidden, so make sure you don't trust your friends, they might be trying to get you killed!&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Detective is a role playing/negotiation/strategy game similar to Mafia/Werewolf. It is slightly more complicated and advanced, and should probably be played by people who have experience with those games. You are dealt a role telling you your powers and which side you are on. You must then try to figure out who is on the opposing side and get them executed, and who is on your side so that you may protect them. Revealing your role card is not allowed, but feel free to lie and deceive your way to winning.&#10;&#10;Components: All that you absolutely must have is the deck of cards to play (which can be found here). But it is strongly recommended that you play this game with a loaded cap gun for added tension and theme. Dark lighting and theme music will also enhance the experience.&#10;&#10;"

The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.&#10;Historically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.&#10;&#10;The overall 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&quot;x42&quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map. The main map is divided into four areas: Blue Beach, Dieppe town, Green Beach and Rear. Each hex represents 400 meters (438 yards) across; each game turn equals 20 minutes. Units of maneuver are companies and batteries; there are 176 large-size NATO-style and iconic counters in the mix.&#10; Rules cover such things as: coastal battery fire, random events, unit depth, command-control and communication, air attack, &ldquo;what if&rdquo; variants, amphibious warfare and much more. The game can be completed in about three to four hours. The turn sequence is as follows.&#10;&#10;I. CW Amphibious Transport Phase&#10;1. Unit Transport&#10;2. Landing Check&#10;II. Operations Phase&#10;III. Commonwealth Action Phase&#10;1. Beach Landings or Evacuation.&#10;2. CW Actions&#10;3. Recovery&#10;IV. End of Turn Phase&#10;&#10;"

Combining large-scale map movement with a fast-play set of tactical rules, the game lets players follow a convoy from embarkation to destination in a single play session.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;map game&quot;, convoys move in eight-hour operational turns, rolling for engagements with U-boats, blockade runners, raiders, and even weather. A large-scale map and tables generate one or more events each turn. Some events are resolved immediately with a few die rolls. Others, such as attacks by U-boats or raiders are resolved with the fast-play tactical rules.&#10;&#10;The Battle of the Atlantic is broken down into several areas and periods, each covered in a seperate map/game module. &#10;Convoy: Deadly Waters is the first such module, covering the Gibraltar Run from January 1941 through December 1942. Each module includes a CD-ROM with full-color damage cards for all the ships and subs needed for convoy battles in that period.&#10;&#10;Convoy will be supported by other map games currently under development. These cover other parts of the Battle of the Atlantic as well as the desperate Murmansk/Soviet lifeline. Designed by Mal Wright, the game system incorporates Mal's thorough research of published sources including interviews with veterans from both sides of the conflict, and illustrates the operational realities of the Battle of the Atlantic.&#10;&#10;Both the map game booklets and tactical rules emphasize simplicity and fast play. Accompanied by sidebars and historical background, they are an excellent introduction for a gamer new to naval warfare, or one who wants to deepen his understanding of this critical naval campaign.&#10;&#10;"

The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. They fight so hard in fact that an army general is sacked because of the toughness of the Japanese defenses.  The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.&#10;&#10;The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.&#10;&#10;The are a number of scenarios that simulate the The Recapture of Saipan, The Recapture of Tinian, Death Valley, and possibly others.  There will be numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.  These include additional Japanese forces that could have been there if they were not sunk by US submarines, and having more artillery available for the main battle in lieu of having shore batteries.&#10;&#10;Key Features&#10;                &#10;4 11&quot;x17&quot; game maps of Saipan and Tinian&#10;BOS representations (level of fidelity)&#10;    Maneuver (Medium)&#10;    Fire Support (Medium)&#10;    Air Defense (Low)&#10;    Mobility and Survivability (Medium)&#10;    Combat Service Support (Low)&#10;    Intelligence (Low)&#10;    Command and Control (Medium)&#10;Approximately 900 unit counters and markers&#10;Unit breakdowns (virtually all of them)&#10;Easy to learn and play&#10;&#10;"
