From approximately 1700 BC to 1200 BC (which was the abrupt end of the Bronze Age) the chariot reigned supreme on the battlefield. It was the first modern weapons system, and chariots controlled most of warfare until actual cavalry appeared in the middle of the Iron Age.&#10;  &#10;But how did chariots work as a tactical weapons system? There is no complete historical agreement on what exactly they did or how they were used, but Chariots of Fire will show you our view of their many applications - and many types of chariotry there were - providing GBoH players with the complete and definitive chariot rules. These rules cover combat and mobility from the first battle wagons of the Sumerians to the two-man, fast-moving light chariots of the Egyptians, often complete with their associated and specialized Runner Infantry, to the heavy 3-man Hittite wheels.&#10; To simulate these ancient tactical details Chariots of Fire presents you with nine battles:&#10;Sumer (ca 2320 BC) - featuring the legendary Sargon the Great&#10;Sekhmen (1875 BC)&#10;Megiddo (ca 1479 BC)&#10;Senzar (1470)&#10;The Astarpa (1312 BC)&#10;Kadesh (1300 BC)&#10;Nihriya (1230 BC)&#10;Babylon (1225 BC)&#10;and Troy (1200 BC) - including an extra: Homer's heros!&#10;&#10;And of armies Chariots of Fire has plenty, and a truly colorful bunch they are: Sumerians, Akkadians, all sorts of Egyptians, Canaanites, Hittites, Mitanni, Arzawans, Assyrians, Babylonians, and the Mycenaean Age Greeks.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;TIME SCALE     20 minutes per turn  &#10;MAP SCALE     100 yards per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE      350 men per mounted unit &#10;PLAYING TIME     1-3 hours&#10;&#10;&#10;(from BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Historical Note: The period following The Bronze Age, from what is known as The Catastrophe of ca. 1200 BC to the rise of the Greek city-states, is almost totally devoid of any sort of information, and that includes archaeological  remains.

Using a quick-playing, card-driven game system, each player assumes the role of a French soldier -- or grognard -- starting out as a young sergeant or sous-lieutenant trying to make it in life beginning in 1792. Fortunately for the enterprising grognard, he can look forward to over twenty years of almost continuous war provided courtesy of the Directory and Napol&eacute;on!&#10;&#10;Game play is broken down into a series of campaign seasons that span the period from the Brunswick Manifesto in 1792 to The Hundred Days of 1815. Each campaign season consists of a number of 'In Garrison' rounds and 'On Campaign' rounds. During these rounds, major historical events take place, from the arrest and execution of Louis XVI to the coronation of Napol&eacute;on, from great battles to the &quot;whiff of grapeshot.&quot; History is fixed, with events happening like they actually did, that is, with one exception: will the English christen that climactic battle of 1815 The Battle of Waterloo or will the victorious French name it La Bataille de Mont Saint Jean?!&#10;&#10;Against this historical backdrop, grognards take advantage of the opportunities that Fate provides to advance their station in life. Will you be lucky enough to be assigned to the Army of the Orient with Napol&eacute;on himself or will you be marooned in the Army of the Rhine et Moselle? Will you exhibit reckless bravery under the Emperor&rsquo;s eye at Austerlitz, or will you sit out the 1805 campaign, recovering from wounds suffered in a pointless minor skirmish? It&rsquo;s both up to you and to Fate. Each grognard has a number of qualities that are key to game play:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rank: From Sergent to Marechal (is there a baton in your knapsack?)&#10;     Title and Office: Reserved only for the most senior grognards&#10;     Legion of Honor: Has your bravery been suitably recognized?&#10;     Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s Notice: You can&rsquo;t command a regiment without this&#10;     Glory: Are you known as a bold fire-eater, forever brave?&#10;     Money: Has fortune shined on you in more tangible ways?&#10;     Health: Will the predations of war force you into retirement?&#10;     Charm: Of course; this is a game about Frenchmen, n'est pas?&#10;     Fencing: Useful for skewering a fellow grognard who insults you&#10;     Standing: Does your commander hold you in high esteem or contempt?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Play:&#10;Winning the game is achieved in a number of ways: having the highest award in the Legion of Honor, having the highest military rank, or having the most glory or wealth. The game is entirely suitable for  solitaire play through six players (and perhaps even a few more). Legion of Honor consists of two short scenarios of 4 hours each that cover the Republican Period and the Imperial Period. The grand scenario spans both periods and takes 8 hours to play.&#10;&#10;"

Each player may swap any card (except Hades) for the face-up card or give any card they like &quot;including Hades) to the player on their left, taking a card in return.

The first person to make a set calls out &quot;Olympus!&quot; The loser is then the person who is left with Hades.&#10;&#10;"
