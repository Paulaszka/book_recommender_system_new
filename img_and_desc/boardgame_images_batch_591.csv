Grey alien soldiers are everywhere. Alien rule is immanent. It's up to you and the teenage trouble making Task Force to save humanity. The Night of the Saucers is upon us, and Earth's only hope just got out of detention.&#10;&#10;Night of the Saucers is a collaborative game for 1 to 4 players, ages 8 and up. The average game lasts about an hour, but its not uncommon for a game to stretch towards the two hour mark. It all depends on how many missions you choose to complete and how many cards you decide to include in the alien deck.&#10;&#10;Each player controls 3 high school students that are stuck in detention when aliens attacked and take over the city. Now it's up to the students to take the city back. You must move about the board searching buildings for supplies to fight the aliens with. At the end of every turn, each player draws an alien card that deploys new aliens onto the board and directs the movements of the alien army. Sometimes devastating Saucer Strikes will be drawn that blow up the buildings tiles and everything on them. This makes the board treacherous to navigate and supplies harder to come by. The way you win is by completing Task Force missions or by surviving the alien deck.&#10;&#10;Night of the Saucers is a fun and easy game with cool miniatures set in an 80s action-movie inspired environment. We like to say it's like Red Dawn meets Independence Day with the Breakfast Club. Are you listening Hollywood?&#10;&#10;"

It is played on a triangular grid, with the ships moving from intersection to intersection. The ships are represented by pieces of wood with holes drilled to hold small flags; the position of the flag in a ship represents its speed. The color of a flag represents how many operational guns the ship has.&#10;&#10;Movement is performed by spending one knot (movement point) for each intersection moved and/or each 60 degrees turned. Ships may not sail directly into the wind, which may shift at the start of each round (based on a die roll).&#10;&#10;When a ship fires at a target it declares whether it is aiming at the decks or the rigging and rolls on the appropriate table. The die roll needed to hit further depends on the number of guns the attacker has, the class of the target (1st, 2nd, or 3rd rate), the range, and whether the target is beam on or end on to the attacker.&#10;&#10;There are a few additional rules for heaving to and boarding.&#10;&#10;The rules were published in Games &amp; Puzzles #1 (May 1972).&#10;&#10;"

If two players play on the same solo challenge, their tribe cards are moved to the duel challenge, then all other tribe cards are placed on solo challenges.&#10;&#10;Starting with the chief, each player attempts to perform the trick shown on the challenge, with the value of the tribe card played showing how many jacks on the table must be used in the challenge. A challenge might have you setting jacks on edge, throwing a jack over a wall formed by your other hand, move jacks from the table into your other hand, and so on. If at any time, you fail to catch your jack, your turn ends &mdash; although you can twice discard a tribe card from your hand to replay the challenge. If you succeed, you keep the tribe card you played.&#10;&#10;In a duel, the first player to complete the duel keeps one of the two tribe cards played.&#10;&#10;After all solo and duel challenges are complete, everyone participates in a final challenge to determine who will be chief for the next round.

Those ships drilled, mined and transported raw minerals from faraway planetary systems back to Earth. Soon hundreds upon hundreds of star systems were visited and their planets were drilled down to their cores and stripped of valuable resources. After the ships moved on to the next system, the leftover excavation installations still lingered as a grim sign of past mining operations. In no time, two corporations monopolized the galaxy mining business, but with myriad systems to exploit they remained in a state of uneasy peace &mdash; a peace about to be broken due to an automated analysis of reports from a system mined many decades ago that yielded something weird, that led to a discovery of...Metallum.&#10;&#10;This new substance, which seems to carry a promise for interstellar travel for living organisms, is bound to stir conflict. The Earth Government immediately steps in and claims ownership of the system in the name of the &quot;good of mankind&quot;, but it's clear that one of the two corporations will be afforded the exclusive rights to extract Metallum &ndash; and the huge profits that come with it. The tension raises instantly. Outright corporate war is avoided only thanks to a promise to grant the mining rights to the corporation that will develop more efficient mining infrastructure on the planets. Incidents are bound to happen with old installations used to destroy enemy Extractors since it's clear that the Earth Government will be handing their grants based on Metallum extraction rates of each corporation before finally awarding exclusive mining rights to one of them. The best pilots from each corporation sit down behind their consoles as their factory ships approach the system with production of Extractors set to maximum.&#10;&#10;Metallum is a strategy game for two players who take on roles of corporate pilots charged with the task of directing their factory ships in order to construct a more efficient mining network on the system's planets than their opponent does. Each round consists of three main phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Programming: Players simultaneously create a program by composing puzzle-like subroutines that activate various systems on the factory ship (engines for moving, production for deploying Extractors, etc.). Some of the more powerful subroutines take more time to execute and hence impede your ability to react to the other player's moves &mdash; and they might even prevent you from activating other ship systems.&#10;     Action: Players execute programs composed during the programming phase. Since the order of execution of subroutines is decided by the player, the same program can yield vastly different outcomes, which leads to many interesting tactical decisions. During this phase new Extractors are also deployed on the system's planets.&#10;     Profits: Players earn credits for the planets on which they have their Extractors depending on who has more of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the pilot who's earned the most credits for his corporation is declared the winner. Will you be able to cover the planets of the system with a network of your Extractors and at the same time disturb the plans of your opponent? Although the conflict is officially only an economic one, the successful pilot needs to know when to strike at a rival's mining infrastructure or make &quot;slight modification&quot; to it.

The narrator&rsquo;s job is the most important. The feeling of the game entirely depends on their ability to keep the game interesting. It is the narrator&rsquo;s job to tell the story of what happened the previous night. A narrator should make it interesting, share a story that will invoke suspense, horror, humor, and lead to a great debate. While the debate ensues the narrator should keep to themselves unless they need to step in for clarification. A narrator should never do anything to sway a vote or influence any of the players.&#10;&#10;Game play follows the traditional Mafia/Werewolf set up. The game is over if the number of Mafiosi/werewolves outnumber the civilians or if all members of the Mafia/werewolves are lynched.&#10;&#10;"

These rogue data jockeys pit themselves against the most secure systems in the world for the thrill of it (and maybe to make a little money on the side). However, the most skilled hackers know it's not about getting there first; it's about ghosting in and out of the system without leaving a trace.&#10;&#10;Black Hat is a hacker-themed, climbing trick-taking board game for 2-6 players. While trick-taking is the main mechanism used in the game, you can win the game even if you win only a few tricks &mdash; as long as you win the ones that make the most for your game. Black Hat features a random and evolving game board that players progress through during the game, and while that progress helps you toward victory, the first player to finish doesn't necessarily win.&#10;&#10;Black Hat allows a wide variety of gameplay strategies to be applied, none of them clearly superior over another, as you have to adapt to the situation.&#10;&#10;"

It has now become a major source of income for the Texan farmers, while at the same time attracting cattle thieves of all kinds.&#10;&#10;In Longhorn, the players assume the roles of two particularly feared outlaws: Eagle Perkins and Jessie Artist Byrd. The aim of the game is simple: to steal cattle (and a few gold nuggets, if possible) to see who can amass the most money by the end of the game &mdash; or who can get his opponent arrested by the sheriff!&#10;&#10;The game is set up by shuffling the 9 locations and setting them up in a 3x3 grid, selecting 9 tokens randomly and assigning one to each location (if the sheriff token is in play, it must be placed on Nugget Hill), and finally randomly distributing the coloured longhorn cattle meeples to each location, with the number required being shown on each location. The start player then chooses a location with 4 cattle and places the player piece in it.&#10;&#10;The game ends in one of three ways:&#10;- If a player takes the sheriff token, they lose immediately&#10;- If a player takes all 9 cattle of any one colour, they win immediately (if they did both in the same turn, they lose)&#10;- If no legal move can be made, the players score; gold nugget tokens are worth their face value and each colour of longhorn is worth $100 for each cow of the same colour still on the board. For example, if the Perkins player has 4 black cattle and 5 are left on the board, each of his 4 black longhorns are worth $500. If there are no black cattle (because the Byrd player has them, or through drought) then they are worth nothing. The player with the highet total wins.&#10;&#10;On a players turn, they choose a colour of longhorn present in their location and steal all of that colour. For each longhorn stolen, the player moves the player piece that many spaces and then flips it, to signify that it is now the other player's turn.&#10;&#10;If a location is cleared of longhorn cattle, the player who took the last longhorn must take the token present and activate it. Some are positive and some are negative. Once a space is cleared, it can not be moved to in a future turn, though it can be moved through.&#10;&#10;"

An Axis attack was met by a furious Allied counter-attack which then developed into a grinding battle of attrition and maneuver that finally ended in massive Axis victory.&#10;&#10;Alternating random activation by formation provides player with uncertainty and high re-playability as no two games will be alike. Each turn player receive a varying number of activations to represent the supply levels, command confusion, fatigue and intelligence of their armies and this leads to an ebb and flow to the battle as each side is dominant at different times. After units move, strengths are educed to simulate fatigue and lack of defensive preparation making counter-attacking key to the game.
