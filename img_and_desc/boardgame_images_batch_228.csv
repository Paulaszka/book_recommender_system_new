The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.&#10;&#10;The  opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.&#10;&#10;From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.&#10;&#10;To the Barricades!, the first title in the War Storms series, is a game which attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually happened.&#10;&#10;"

Players must seek out valuable metals and fuel materials and mine them, using the materials to feed their home planets, and inch closer to victory, while at the same time allocating resources to maintain or strengthen their armed forces and fortifications. Drill tanks tunnel beneath the surface of the planet while drilling stations pound away from above. Drilling stations are faster and more efficient, but are vulnerable to attack from above and even capture by enemy troops. But tunnels can cave in&hellip; And market forces are unpredictable. The resource making your planet rich today might be better off greasing the treads of your tanks tomorrow!&#10;&#10;The game takes place on two maps &ndash; one representing ground level and above, the other representing underground terrain. The rules differ slightly depending upon the map on which action occurs. At the beginning of the game, the subterranean map is unmarked: it is solid. As the game progresses, units will drill beneath the surface of the planet, creating tunnels through which they and other units can explore the sub-surface, mining for riches and engaging each other in combat. Each map parallels the other, in that each hex on one map represents the same coordinates, just at a radically different elevation (above or below ground) on the other map. Maps are labeled in columns and rows so that it is possible to find corresponding hexes quickly. Hex B4 on the surface map is considered to be directly above hex B4 on the subterranean map, and so on. It is recommended that a new subterranean map be printed out for each game, so that it can be marked throughout the game and discarded at the end.&#10;&#10;Counters represent mobile units such as drill tanks, transport vehicles, hovertanks, missile launchers, atmo-craft, and squads of infantry with jump-jet powered armour; structures such as command posts and drilling stations; extracted resources; and rubble. They are printed with varying information. Resource counters show the type and quantity of resource with a letter and number. Units are printed with a movement type, attack strength, range, defense strength, and movement points.&#10;&#10;Elements include tactical level sf combat using a terrain-and-elevation-based combat system, satellite searches for ore deposits, in-game allocation of resources to build units and outposts, resource extraction and re-use, resource allocation towards victory, varying resource value depending on market fluctuations, airstrikes, cave-ins, and underground combat.&#10;&#10;"

One set is for the server (marked 'S'), and one set is for the receiver (marked 'R'). Each set has a red, a white and a blue die.&#10;&#10;Server rolls their dice first. If the serve is good (indicated on the red Server die), then receiver rolls their dice as well and proceed as in paragraph below. If the serve is out (indicated on the red server die), receiver scores a point. The appropriate person (according to the rules of tennis) then takes the Server dice and begins a new point by rolling the Server dice as previous.&#10;&#10;The dice are always read in the order Red-White-Blue and alternating between the Server's dice and the Receiver's dice. The dice say things like 'Serve Good', 'Lob Good', 'Return Out', 'Overhead Smash Out', etc. So, first read the red Server die - if the serve is good, read the red Returner die - if good, read the white Server die - if good, read the white Returner die... Continue alternating reading the dice until the ball goes out or all the dice are read and the ball is still good. Score as in tennis. Switch dice when changing server.&#10;&#10;"
