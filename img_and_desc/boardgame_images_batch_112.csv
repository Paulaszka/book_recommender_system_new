This game could be played either head-to-head by two players, or solo against the game itself.&#10;&#10;The owner of the game was expected to apply a Sticker Stat (bar code) label to either the 24 game-provided cards or his own baseball cards. As cards were inserted into the main unit, batting/pitching stats for the corresponding player would then be read and used in game play. For those who did not wish to sully their baseball cards with the adhesive stickers, a standard lineup was provided within the hand held unit.&#10;&#10;Stickers for player performance in the 1988 season were provided within the base game. An order form was also available to those who wished to buy stickers for the 1989 season.&#10;&#10;"

The middle board represents the land and has pieces like the Oliphant, the Thief, and (of course) the King. The bottom board represents the underworld and contains pieces like the Dwarf and the Elemental.&#10;&#10;Like regular chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's King. Many pieces move like their chess counterparts, but many others have unconventional moves taken from other chess variants that are further complicated by the game's three dimensional nature.&#10;&#10;For example, on the upper board, a Sylph piece moves like a Berolina pawn. It may make a non-capturing move one space diagonally forward, or it may capture by moving directly forward one space. It may also capture by moving straight down to the middle board. While on the middle board, the Sylph cannot move at all except to make a non-capturing move back to the top board. It may move to the square directly above it OR any empty one of the six home squares that any friendly Sylph occupied at the start of the game.&#10;&#10;"

12839,,"Up to 4 people can play, one controlling each German army group (North, Center, and South), and one playing Russia. Russia gets 5 factories to place in the cities of their choosing at the beginning of the game. Each produces a specific unit type (2 infantry, 1 armor, 1 fighter, 1 bomber). Germany can't see anything in Russian cities. Russia keeps its units and factories hidden from view on a city card. When Russian troops move out of cities, they are moved from the city card to the main board.&#10;&#10;Railroads connect many of the Russian cities, which they can use to non-combat troops from city to city hidden from German view. Germany may try to cut the rails to limit Russian movement. Germany may scout Russian cities with a bomber to try and find out what is there, however, you can't scout and attack on the same army group's turn. Therefore, one army group must scout, and the next in the turn sequence can attack.&#10;&#10;The German players must work closely together in this game. German troops may be transferred from one army group to another, and are then controlled by that new groups player. Because of the hidden units, it is a game of high tension on both sides. Most of the time Germany isn't really sure what Russia has in a city it is about to attack. And, most of the time, Russia has nowhere near enough troops to defend everything they need to defend. There is a lot of cat and mouse, educated guessing, and downright devious strategy (&quot;Hum, he would expect me to do this, so I'll do that. But he might be counting on me taking the less obvious choice...&quot;&#10;&#10;The goal is for Germany to take Moscow, but to do this, they almost always need to take out the Russian factories which are producing units closer to the front. To make matters worse, Russia can dismantle, and move each of their factories once to another city. So, just when you think you have it all figured out... We're usually nervous wrecks by the end of a game...and usually ready to start another one right away!&#10;&#10;"

You keep track of when ships were built on a ship record sheet.  Newer ships have better technology and gain a bonus in combat against older ships.  You can pick a specific area to develop every few turns: offense, defense, movement, etc.  Ships range from transports to fighters to large battlecruisers.

12856,,"Shove ha'penny is a traditional British pub (tavern) game of dexterity and skill dating from the the mid 19th Century, with earlier variants in existence as early as the 15th Century. It is still widely played today.&#10;&#10;Players push ('shove') polished coins (half pennies, traditionally) along a board which has been marked out in horizontal bands, called 'beds'. The most common method is to place the coin on the bottom edge of the board, slightly overhanging, and tap it with the heel of the hand. The aim of the game is to position coins within the beds, with no part touching the bands. This requires considerable skill.&#10;&#10;Players must get a coin in each bed three times. Each success is scored, often with a cribbage style peg and hole system up the side of the board or with chalk tallies.&#10;&#10;Boards are made of wood or slate.&#10;&#10;"

12862,,"Gess is a chess-like two-player abstract that is played with a Go-Ban (that is, a go set), although it uses the squares formed by the grid rather than the intersections of the grid, and the squares around the outside edge of the board are not used. Thus, you play the game on an 18&times;18 grid.&#10;&#10;The 'pieces' are 3&times;3 patterns of go stones, with each possible pattern of stones representing a different type of piece, each of which moves in a different way.  Rather than the pieces remaining the same throughout the game, however, a player can use any 3&times;3 portion of the board that contains at least one of his stones and none of his opponent's stones.  This means that two pattern-pieces can move near each other, and then portions of each of the original pieces can be moved away together as a different piece, leaving behind the remainder of the original formations, which can, in turn, be used as other pieces.&#10;&#10;If a piece moves in such a way that it overlaps one or more stones (of either player), all stones that the piece moves onto are captured.&#10;&#10;Each player must maintain one piece that is a ring of eight stones around an empty square at all times.  If one player is in a position where he no longer has such a ring anywhere on the board for any reason, he loses.&#10;&#10;"
