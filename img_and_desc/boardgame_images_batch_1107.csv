373156,,"(formerly known as Ancient Warfare)&#10;&#10;These rules cover classical warfare in the ancient world from the rise of Egypt to the fall of Rome.&#10;&#10;The essence of Ancient Conquest is command and the role of the general on the battlefield. Using simple mechanics, the player will find himself thrust into the role of battle manager on a very personal level, and in a very chaotic environment.&#10;&#10;Soldiers in the game are rated for their equipment, but also their experience level and specific skills. There are no abstract &quot;troop classes&quot;, although you will find that certain combinations of training and equipment necessarily encourage specific deployments on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;Ancient Conquest, on the other hand, was created from the very beginning with historical encounters in mind. Units were tested not against the theory of how they ought to have done against different troop types, but rather against the reality of their historical performance in actual battles.&#10;&#10;More than anything else, the atmosphere of the game is different from that of most other ancients rules. Many rules are rigid and chess-like in their portrayal of ancient warfare, so that the games are very cerebral in nature. Ancient Conquest is anything but that. Ancient battles were confused and &#10;violent. They were personal and visceral, not impersonal and abstract. Above all else, Ancient Conquest aims at reproducing that sense.&#10;&#10;Oracle cards introduce an additional element of unpredictability to the game, and provide players with an additional means of influencing play.&#10;&#10;The ground scale using the recommended base size is 1:1500, which means that one millimeter equals one and a half meters of actual ground. (One inch equals about 40 meters of real terrain.) This means that the frontage of a base is 90 meters (about 100 yards).&#10;&#10;In general, a stand represents infantry or cavalry deployed four to six ranks deep and as many files wide as will fit in a 90 meter frontage (about 100 files for infantry or 65 files for cavalry). Formations of greater depth than four to six ranks are represented by placing multiple bases one behind another.&#10;&#10;Strength of Stands&#10;Infantry: 500 infantry (4-6 ranks of about 100 files each).&#10;Cavalry: 330 cavalry (4-6 ranks of about 65 files each).&#10;Chariots: 100 small (2-3 man) or 50 large (4-5-man, and all scythed) chariots&#10;Elephants: 10 elephants (in one or two ranks)&#10;Engines: 20 bolt throwers or 10 stone throwers.&#10; For very large battles, double scale armies (1 stand per 1000 infantry or 650 cavalry) may be used, and for small actions half scale may be used (1 stand per 250 infantry or 160 cavalry) may be used.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the rulebook&#10;&#10;"

From other side is printed an ornament. Each chip has on the sides 3 different symbols, made as shaped cutouts, it is a triangle, a square and a circle. 6 play chips from 66 are rare POWERCHIPS, they are described with cut-through marks. Game rules are based on using the pictures or using the cutouts. No gameboard is needed, only small piece of flat place is enough to play 3KSES. &#10;Two players compete against each other, 4 and 6 players then builds a team which is cooperating and competing other team.&#10;&#10;Game 1 | FIND A MATCH  - 66 play chips are placed on table in 11 groups, 6 pieces of chips i each group. Players are trying to find 2 pictures of the same building to get a MATCH, in the end of the game the winner with more pairs wins the game. IT is good memory fitness training.&#10;&#10;Game 2 | JOINTS - 66 play chips are distributed to players, each player gets same amount of chips and put in a stack in front of them in a column. The shaped cutout symbols on the chips are used here. First player put first play chip from his stack on a desk and other player can lay one of his chips to connect it only with the same symbol to one of the chips laying on the table, it makes a JOINT between two connected chip. For each JOINT made player plays one new chip, so if it makes 2 JOINTs - is playing 2 times in his turn, gives quicklier chips from his stack to the table. The trick is to get a combination of more chips near each other to build 2 or 3 JOINTs in one time. &#10;POWERCHIPS is special, of course, doesn't need to be played out when in top of stack, but can be put near for later use and play normal chip instead. POWERCHIP has the ability to turn chips to get a compatible shape for connection.   &#10;Player or team who first gets rid of all chips of their stack is a Winner.

The mines held vast amounts of gold and precious stones. The river that flows through the town kept bringing smaller crystals and sometimes even diamonds with it. This earned the city the name Fortune&rsquo;s Creek. Anyone could get rich here, you just have to reach out and grab your hand.&#10;&#10;But with wealth, corruption also found its way into the city and criminals soon regulated all trade routes. The legislature found itself powerless, but after three sheriffs disappeared in a very short time, the government sent a small army from Washington to ensure law and order in the city. However, the current rulers of Fortune&rsquo;s Creek were unwilling to give up their gold mine without resistance and so it came to a wild, brutal battle that lasted for several days. Not only did criminals and crooks fall, many innocent people also died in the hail of bullets. After two days the last bullet was fired and the then corrupt mayor McKanzy was executed by the American army shortly afterwards. The city was now back in the hands of the state.&#10;&#10;The events seemed to have affected not only the city but also the countryside, because the gold veins in the mines dried up and the river no longer brought any glittering stones with it. The once rich trading city became poorer and poorer. Where there was one joy and confidence, there was now more and more despair. This is how the city got its nickname Devil&rsquo;s Creek. Only those who ventured deep into the mines could find gold - if they came out again. Those who made it reported strange creatures that have since found their home there. Soon hardly any people dared to venture into the widely ramified mine systems and the city was forgotten by history. You and your small group will end up in Devil&rsquo;s Creek. Maybe you can get to the bottom of this and bring the city back to its former size.&#10;&#10;The setting is enriched with &quot;low fantasy&quot; elements. You take on the role of three adventurers, take jobs in the local saloon and roam the countless mines of Fortune&rsquo;s Creek, which were once rich in gold veins and are now inhabited by all sorts of creatures and other rabble.&#10;&#10;WHAT DO I NEED TO PLAY?&#10;&#10;To play, you need a piece of squared paper, a pencil, at least three 6-sided dice and one 4-sided dice. You should also have the attached cards printed out and arranged in a stack ready to hand.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;Adventures in Devil&rsquo;s Creek can best be classified under the category of &quot;Dungeon Diver&quot;. You put together a group of three different characters (Brawler, Valkyrie, Voodoo Priest, White Witch, Gunslinger or Bounty Hunter) and set off to explore the local mines. Before or between the explorations, supplies can be replenished in the city, quests can be accepted or you can just relax and heal your wounds. It can be played by 1 to 3 players. The opponents are rolled and their behavior is determined by the drawing of cards.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;After creating the characters, you take a piece of squared paper, on which you draw the spaces that have been thrown out of the mine. The use of a DIN A5 sheet is recommended. Dice out the first room and draw it in the middle on one edge. Then you roll the dice on the space and resolve the encounters. If you defeat a boss, you have cleared the mine. The mine systems are reset and rerolled with each visit.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The port was bequeathed to King Charles II as part of a dowry when he married the Portuguese princess, Catherine of Braganza. It would be another generation before the English captured Gibraltar from Spain, but Tangier seemed an ideal base for many of the same reasons. It would be a handy staging post for ships bound for West Africa and the Caribbean, it would place a watch upon the Catholic Spanish, and it might facilitate trade with the Moors, the port being one terminus of the ancient caravan route for slaves and gold-dust. There were only two problems. First, the Moors hated outsiders. Second, but more importantly, the port lay open to the worst the Atlantic could throw at it. The anchorage was deep, but it was unprotected. For twenty-two years the English tried to maintain themselves at Tangier, and withstood at least two significant sieges by the Moors, but at last the Government decided they had wasted enough money, though the fact that the Moors had at last forged a unified (and powerful) kingdom might have had something to do with the decision to pull out.&#10;&#10;The Last Labour of Hercules is part card game and part wargame. Covering a period of twenty years, it does not represent a single siege of Tangier but many attempts, some large and some small, by the Moors, to dislodge the English. For long periods the protagonists tolerated each other, and the English even formed the odd local alliance. The Moors spent much of the period of occupation engaged in a brutal civil war &mdash; or put another way, they were in the process of emerging from Medieval anarchy. Also, they had to ward off attempts by the Ottoman Sultan to reestablish his suzerainty over the land.&#10;&#10;As the English player you must keep the Moors at bay while gauging how many of your precious resources you can spare to build Tangier&rsquo;s Great Mole &ndash; a breakwater that will protect your ships. As the Moorish player you must endevour to make the English inclined to leave, ideally by sacking Tangier. At the same time, you have two additional problems to deal with. First, there is the small matter of a civil war among the Berber tribes. Then, there is the Sultan at Istanbul. He seems to be under the false impression that Morocco belongs to him. If the Moors ever take the town's Citadel they win outright. If the English ever complete the Great Mole they win outright. If neither side can achieve their main objective, someone might or might not win on points, by comparing the English player&rsquo;s progress on the Mole against the Moorish player&rsquo;s ability to secure Morocco for his dynasty.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Now you can shape the course of Japanese history through skillful use of your loyal clans and manipulation of your allies whilst taking full advantage of natural events as they occur.&#10;As one of 2-4 players, you will control one or more of feudal clans trying to establish supremacy over all of Japan.

Featuring floods, earthquakes, typhoons, peasant rebellions, pirates, famine and much more. There will be epic sieges and titanic open battles, as well as the chance to assassinate hated enemies.&#10;&#10;The map will consist of one 22&quot;x34&quot; map covering all of mainland Japan and the two southern islands (Kyushu and Shikoku). Map labels will be in easy-to-read English font with accompanying Japanese characters to add historical flavor to proceedings. There will be 2 countersheets of 9/16&quot; counters representing the 8 different major clans and 8 different minor clans, troop markers, plus various game effect counters. Two decks of cards (110 total) will be included.  A full color rulebook will include synopses of some of the major players of this period (the Sengoku Jidai) as well as other fascinating historical tidbits to enhance the flavor of the game.&#10;&#10;The basic game will be quick to learn and easy to play but the players will have a host of optional rules that will add greater detail, such as battle tactics, different types of soldiers (spearmen, samurai, arquebusiers, etc.), defections, and alliances. There will be a number of scenarios, allowing one to play anything from the full war (1554-1614) to shorter campaigns.&#10;&#10;Depending on interest, there may also be an extension to allow players to start from the traditional beginning of the Sengoku Jidai, 1467.

Your Marines are tough but isolated as the Japanese build up around you. Your biggest asset is Henderson Field, a small airstrip that gives you control of the sea lanes during the day; at night, the Japanese sneak in boats with men and supplies, and sometimes bombard the field directly. You must weigh the various threats against you and defend the island until relief comes.&#10;&#10;You are the American player in the game as it centers on Japanese attempts to capture Henderson Field by land. They have three avenues of attack: from the east (Koli Point), west (Point Cruz), or south (Bloody Ridge). Your mission will not be easy. Good luck. Now you are in command and the decisions are yours&hellip;&#10;&#10;All you need to provide is a die, a pen, and a sense of adventure to play.&#10;&#10;GAME SUMMARY&#10;Guadalcanal: Solitaire contains 24 game plays of the solitaire gameboard.

Starting with the First Battle of St. Albans when Richard of York captured Henry VI, the two houses fought for control of England until the controversial king, Richard III, was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.&#10;&#10;After his victory at Bosworth Field, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York. With this marriage the House of Lancaster and the House of York were combined, and the House of Tudor was born and gained control of England.&#10;&#10;Warriors of England is a quick playing game covering the War of the Roses (1455-1487) and uses similar game mechanics as Multi-Man Publishing&rsquo;s Warriors of God game covering The Hundred Years War.&#10;&#10;Each player controls Nobles from their respective house (Lancaster and York) and vies for control of lesser Nobles who may leave your cause during battle. Each Noble controls troops and participates in campaigns to gain control of areas that add to their victory points. Control of areas also allows nobles to raise more troops for the cause!&#10;&#10;Battles can lead to the death of your nobles, exile to a foreign land (Scotland, France, and Burgundy) or even imprisonment in the Tower of London. If nobles die in battle, they may be replaced by their heirs who may continue to fight for your claim!&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;        Full color rulebook&#10;        22&rdquo;x34&rdquo; mapsheet&#10;        Two counter sheets (1&rdquo; counters)&#10;        Two Player Aid Cards&#10;        dice&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
