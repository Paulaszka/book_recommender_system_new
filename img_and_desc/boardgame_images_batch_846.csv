Players choose their faction from Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Dark Age Pagans, Ancient Egypt and Eldritch Abominations. Each faction has a unique roster and playstyle, further affected by the player's choice of deity.&#10;&#10;The Mythos Board is the domain of the gods. Each player has one 35mm scale deity model which affects the rolls that they need to make on the battlefield. By way of example, soldiers that follow Ares will fight more effectively in combat than those who follow Hades, but Hades' followers are much tougher to kill. Each deity also has unique abilities called Divine Interventions, such as Osiris resurrecting friendly models or Loki stealing the enemy's dice,  meaning that overall the player's choice of deity has a massive effect on how their army performs. The gods are locked in their own struggle of wills and moods as they move around the Mythos Board. Their position grants further bonuses to their followers depending on what stats the player thinks are most important at the current moment in time.&#10;&#10;The soldiers, beasts and heroes fight on the battlefield in the name of their deity. Legendary Units such as the Lernean Hydra, Julius Caesar and Ragnar Lothbrok are represented by 15mm scale miniautres, while ordinary soldiers are sculpted in 10mm on ranked bases. Players secretly assign their units order tokens and then activate them alternately, carrying out the order. Success or failure comes from dice rolls based on four stats - Wrath, Wisdom, Swiftness and Determination - with the number of dice to be rolled based on the unit's profile, equipment and the position of the patron deity on the Mythos Board. The deity's stats determine the roll for a success.&#10;&#10;The turn structure is set up so that players roll off for priority, move their deities and attempt divine interventions, secretly assign orders to their units, carry out their orders alternately and then finally take break checks and check for victory conditions as determined by the scenario.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

In the 1st round, each player picks one civilization card in the market and gains a number of worker tokens according to the population value indicated on the civilization card. Players may assign workers to action slots in the public region. There are usually 5-6 actions for each player to choose and these actions change between rounds. By assigning workers, players carry out the actions' effects such as earning coins or paying coins for technologies, wonders, or victory points, etc. At the end of a player's turn, workers may return to the player or disappear according to the kind of action it was working on.&#10;&#10;In subsequent rounds, players MAY pick another civilization card to replace their previous one. In that case, you reset the number of your workers to the population value indicated on the new civilization card and you lose the main ability of your previous civilization, but the legacy abilities of all your civilizations last forever. In each game, a player can only pick three civilization cards in total, so deciding when to raise a new civilization and which civilization combinations to pick is a big strategic decision of players.

The game includes both the 'Front 9' for casual golfers and the more advanced 'Back 9' for seasoned veterans.&#10;&#10;In turn order, players choose where to aim their shot and play one card from their hand to affect the result. The other players also play cards to affect the outcome. If the active player has any Control over the shot, they may disregard one or more of the cards played. The shorter the shot, the more control a player has. After the cards are applied, they place their ball token on the aimed spot and the next player goes. In between rounds players draft the cards used in that round for future use. When players make it in on each hole, they move to the next. When all players finish a hole, the last player to finish gets to keep that hole card for future use. The game ends when the first player makes it into the 9th hole. For a full 18 hole game, score is kept and the game is reset for the 'back 9' at this point.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
