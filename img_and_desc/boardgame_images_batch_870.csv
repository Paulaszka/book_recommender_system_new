Organise your carriage as best as you can by properly placing passengers, offering them services and paying attention to their individual preferences. Prove that you are the right person to manage the Skyline Express!&#10;&#10;Skyline Express is an easy entry family board game. On your turn pick a passenger from the waiting line and place them in your carriage. Sounds easy, right? Not necessarily. In order to win you need to concentrate and control the constantly changing situation on the board. Observing the actions of other players, adjusting your strategy to the current round and making sure you fill individual passengers' preferences shows that becoming a manager of an aerial train is not an easy task.&#10;&#10;The game uses familiar mechanisms such as pattern building, set collection, tile placement and action selection and merges them into a fun experience for everyone! It&rsquo;s sure to appeal to fans of games such as Azul, Sagrada and Reef.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have the most victory points after 3 rounds. At the end of every round each player sums up all the points they earned in 3 different ways:&#10;&#10;GOALS&#10;SERVICES&#10;PERSONAS&#10;&#10;On their turn players pick a passenger from the current waiting line to then place in their carriage. Additionally, the player may also perfom actions and aquire SERVICE tiles.&#10;&#10;There are 6 types of passengers in the game. For example, one passenger is considered a PERSONA and has a specific preference tile that goes along with them. The Preference tile indicates where the PERSONA would like to be seated and what passengers they&rsquo;d like to sit with. Fulfill the Persona's preferences and earn big points!&#10;&#10;Every round has 2 GOALS that give victory points if fulfilled.&#10;&#10;For every full compartment players receives a ticket token. Once they've acquired 2 ticket tokens they can then spend them to buy a SERVICE tile. A SERVICE tile gives victory points for every pair of passengers of the types shown on the tile.&#10;&#10;A round ends once all passengers from the Main Hall have been placed in the players' carriages. Players sum up their victory points and the next round begins with new passengers filling up the Main Hall. The game ends after the scoring phase of round 3. The player with the most victory points becomes the manager of the Skyline Express.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Your culture is an heir to the glories of Ancient Egypt and the legendary Kingdom of Kush, but long gone are the days when you were conquering and ruling Egypt. In the game, it is A.D. 1172 and Nubia is under siege! For 400 years, you will battle to defend civilization against the fierce pagans of the Funj, and a jihad of marauding land-hungry Arabs. Deploy your famous archers, build fortified monasteries, send the Crown Prince into battle, and marry off your daughters in a desperate effort to stem the tide.&#10;&#10;This fast-play, fun, and educational solitaire game uses a system created by Darin Leviloff. &ldquo;Mek&rdquo; markers on five converging paths represent hostile Arab and pagan armies that surround your kingdoms. The paths all meet in Soba, your fabulously wealthy capital at the juncture of the Blue and White Nile rivers, where the danger of a &ldquo;Collapse&rdquo; exists if any of those armies makes it that far. In addition, three tracks representing medieval Nubian society (Nobility, Kingship, and the Army) greatly impact the overall situation. A card draw determines which paths and tracks move against you this turn, while the cards teach you about the history of ancient and medieval Nubia. The number of &ldquo;Efforts&rdquo; which you can use to move them back in your favor (if the Effort die roll succeeds) depends on the personal talents of your current Uru (king) and his chief advisor, the Metropolitan Bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church.&#10;&#10;Managing Efforts is key to the game, and you never have as many as you want. You can obtain more by selling off land and using your bishops for political gain instead of their natural religious calling: a short term strategy that can cost you victory points in the end. Each risky gambit is aimed at averting a system-wide social collapse, which can end the game suddenly. Your success (or failure) in holding off the five hostile armies helps determine how many noble families are still on your side when a Collapse approaches, so the better you play the game, the less chance the Collapse gets off the ground.&#10;&#10;As the game draws to a close, the Portuguese are searching Africa for the fabled Christian &ldquo;Kingdom of Prester John.&rdquo; Those legends may refer to you! Can you hold medieval Nubia together long enough to make contact with them and win the game?&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each slice of pizza has two toppings, except for special &quot;kitchen sink&quot; slices, that have all of the available toppings. These special slices are limited to one per pizza. If a player's pizza is completed but does not follow the rules, the player that did not claim a customer can score points for that other player's customer, using their incomplete pizza, provided said pizza DOES follow the placement rules.&#10;&#10;At the end of the round, each player takes their current stack, discard pile, and pizza and combines them to form their new stack for the next round. Customers are randomized and selected again, and the next round begins.&#10;&#10;This continues until at least one player has 15 points, at which time the player with the most points is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The result of this was a dangerous instability, which swept the influence of the main parties in all regions of Korrupt&ocirc;nia, creating a fertile environment for a non-partisan outlet of the whole country. So to conserve the stewardsh... or rather, the Korruptonian democracy, the country's main political parties articulate an emergency electoral campaign in order to regain partisan prestige and elect a representative.&#10;&#10;In order to be able to elect its representative, the party must increase its influence in the regions of the country, through the presence of its candidate or the support of the media, personalities, smaller parties and companies. With the use of mechanics like area control, auction and hand and resource management, Korrupt&ocirc;nia is a strategic game of fantasy themed.&#10;&#10;There are five regions of Korrupt&ocirc;nia, and each one has different demographic characteristics in each game. All these regions begin with a high influence of the partisans and with almost no influence of the great political parties - each party only initiates with a minor influence in its original region. Each player will have five weeks (or five rounds) to reverse this scenario, gaining enough influence for his candidate to lead the polls at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;To achieve this, players will have to manage well each of the phases of the rounds: the campaign phase and the political action phase. In each round, the position of the candidates in the polls will determine the order of the players, in descending order.&#10;&#10;In the campaign stage, players must decide whether to move their candidate and pay the costs (of money and speech, which are two of the three resources that the parties must administer) to campaign wherever they are, gaining influence in doing so .&#10;&#10;After that, in the political actions phase, each player must take one of the actions of the cards in his hand, eventually having to pay his costs (of money, speech and government positions, which are the three features of the game). These actions range from setting up campaign committees, influencing news media for or against candidates, and also hiring famous people for your campaign, joining smaller parties and attracting companies to fund the campaign (these last three actions require a auction with the other parties). After making an action, the player can exchange resources with the political market, which varies with each negotiation, and also use one of the political actions of the open cards on the table, paying extra costs for this. At the end of each round, the party influence in each region determines an update of the voting intentions of the candidates in the polls.&#10;&#10;At the end of five weeks, the party ahead in the polls will win the match.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Will you reach the treasure and escape the labyrinth? Head down you plunge into the depths of the labyrinth ready to take on all that awaits&hellip;&#10;&#10;WINNING AND LOSING THE GAME&#10;&#10;'WIN THE GAME' - Collect at least 3 trophies and each key colour to enter the treasure room. Then defeat the dragon to win the game.&#10;&#10;'LOSE THE GAME' - If your glass is empty you die. Remove the empty glass from the dungeon and place all your mats on to the space you died. Other players can pick up the mats by landing on that space.&#10;&#10;SETTING UP THE GAME&#10;&#10;I. The game is played with 2-4 players. Each player gets a 'dungeon key mat' and a 'key token mat' of the same colour. Remove the unused 'dungeon key mats' and a 'key token mats' from the game.&#10;&#10;II. Randomly place the 'dungeon mats' into a 6 by 6 grid/dungeon. Note: 'dungeon mats' can BE placed in any ORIENTATION.&#10;&#10;III. Place the 'cleared dungeon mats', 'trophy mats' and the rest of the 'key tokens' into piles.&#10;&#10;IV. Layout all the 'magic mats' so they can be seen by all players and study them before the game begins.&#10;&#10;PLAYING THE GAME&#10;&#10;Pick the first player. A player may do the following three things in any order during their turn. When complete the player to the left now takes their turn.&#10;&#10;I - Insert 'dungeon mat' - The first player inserts their 'dungeon mat' into the dungeon with any orientation. They keep the 'dungeon mat' expelled from the opposite side. IF it is the first turn this must be done before a glass filled with beverage is placed on their 'dungeon key mat'.&#10;&#10;II - Move Their Player - The player may now move by flipping the 'event mat'. They move the number under the majority of their leftmost finger.&#10;&#10;- All moves must be used.&#10;- You cannot move diagonally.&#10;- You cannot move through walls.&#10;- A player must move forward in the direction they started moving this turn unless they hit a dead end.&#10;- When the path forks any new direction can be picked.&#10;- If you land on or move over another player, monster(s) or trap you trigger an 'event' (see Events).&#10;&#10;III - Buy a 'magic mat' - To buy a 'magic mat' spend the cost listed on it. You buy it by drinking that many fingers of your beverage. However, another player(s) may contest the purchase by drinking more fingers of their beverage. The player who drank the most fingers takes the 'magic mat' and can use it as and when described. There is only one of each 'magic mat' in the game and so only the 'magic mats' still on the table can be purchased. Once a 'magic mat' has been cast it is placed back on the table.&#10;&#10;EVENTS&#10;&#10;An event is triggered if a player lands on or moves over the following;&#10;&#10;I - Dungeon Key- If they don't already have a 'dungeon key token' of the same colour they can take one.&#10;&#10;II - Another player - The player whose turn it is fights the other player. Both players flip the 'event mat(s)'. Whoever has the highest number wins the fight. Re-Flip on a draw. If the player whose turn it is;&#10;- Wins - They may pass or land on the other player's mat. The winner may move the losing player one legal move away.&#10;- Loses - They must stop in the position prior to the player.&#10;&#10;III - Monster(s) or Trap - The player flips the 'event mat(s)' and must get the number or more displayed on the monster(s)/trap mat. If the player;&#10;- Wins - They win a 'trophy mat' (see Trophies p4). The monster/trap 'dungeon mat' is removed from the dungeon and is replace with the equivalent 'cleared dungeon mat'. Player movement continues.&#10;- Loses - They must drink the number of 'fingers' from their beverage as achieved from their 'event mat(s)' flip. They must also stop in the position prior to the monster(s) or trap.&#10;&#10;IV - Treasure room - A player can only enter the room if they have collected a key of each colour. IF so the player flips the 'event mat(s)' and must get the number or more displayed on the 'treasure room' mat. If the player;&#10;- Wins - They slay the dragon, take the treasure and win the game.&#10;- Loses - They must drink the number of 'fingers' from their beverage as achieved from their 'event mat' flip. They must stop in the position prior to the 'treasure room'.&#10;&#10;TROPHIES&#10;&#10;Players can gain 'trophy mats' by defeating monsters and traps. On the reverse side of a 'trophy mat' is an 'event mat'. this is so trophies can be stacked on top of the 'event mat' to form a stack. Whenever there is an 'event mat' flip for combat or movement the player may choose to flip a stack of 'event mats' with the trophies they have won. Each additional 'event mat' adds one to the result i.e. Flip and catch a 2 with a stack of 3 'event mats' to get a 4.&#10;&#10;FINGERS&#10;&#10;A forfeit in this game is performed by drinking 'fingers' of your beverage. this is done by holding that many of your own fingers against the glass and drinking that volume of your beverage. if there is a dispute in measuring an event mat can be used with one row equalling one finger.&#10;&#10;DIFFICULTY&#10;&#10;Beginner - If new players are finding flipping beer mats hard then they can use a 6 sided dice instead. &#10;Note: The game for those players will lose the skill aspect for catching values they need.&#10;&#10;Intermediate - 'Event mat(s)' can be flipped until caught. Note: This can slow down the game.&#10;&#10;Advanced - If 'event mat(s)' aren&rsquo;t caught you&rsquo;re fined a finger and the result is treated as zero.&#10;&#10;SINGLE PLAYER&#10;&#10;A single player game is played in exactly the same way as playing the normal rules. However there is some reduced setup, as there is no key collecting required so all key token mats can be removed from the game. As there are no other players all 'magic mats' can also be removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The 'magic mat' 'rejuvenate' can optionally remain. If it stays you're committing to potentially more then one drink. IF is removed, as with the 'just the one' variation, the game becomes more about beating the game with a single  glass of beverage.&#10;&#10;VARIATION: JUST THE ONE&#10;&#10;the 'rejuvenate' spell can also be removed to add extra difficulty to the game. It also puts a one drink cap on how much will be drunk in a game. This is a useful variation to implement when the player group only wish to have the one pint.&#10;&#10;VARIATION: HALF PINT DUNGEON&#10;&#10;Instead of playing with a 6x6 dungeon try playing with a 5x5 or 4x4 dungeon. Simply build the dungeon and place the remaining &lsquo;dungeon mats' into a stack. After inserting your dungeon key place the expelled 'dungeon mat' to the bottom of the 'dungeon mat' stack Then on future turns draw a mat from the top of the 'dungeon mat' stack and insert it into the dungeon, and again place the expelled 'dungeon mat' to the bottom of the 'dungeon mat' stack. This variation is useful when you have limited table space.&#10;&#10;GAME LINKING MULTIPLE DRUNKGEONS&#10;&#10;If you have multiple copies of Drunkgeon then they can be joined together to make up to a 6x12 dungeon by combining the 'dungeon mats'. Then use just one set of 'magic mats' and play the normal rules. The game will also now support up to 8 players i.e. two players of each colour.&#10;&#10;FAQ&#10;&#10;Q: Is Drunkgeon designed to get people drunk?&#10;A: No. The game is designed to be a fun first drink management game. A good player will carefully consider the best way to maximise their beverage, whereas other players may blindly run into fights and use magic to replenish their loses. Either style can work but the more sober player is more likely to win.&#10;&#10;Q: How do i shuffle the 'dungeon mats'? Are 'dungeon mats' inserted in a specific orientation?&#10;A: rotate the 'dungeon mats' as you shuffle because they can be inserted into the dungeon in any orientation.&#10;&#10;Q: Do you have to drink alcohol? what happens if glasses are different sizes?&#10;A: You may drink any beverage. Ideally everyone should use the same sized pint glass and beverage. However, if different make an agreement among yourselves i.e. a player drinks more glasses or uses smaller or larger 'finger' sizes. If anybody under the legal drinking age is playing the game then all players should drink non-alcoholic drinks.&#10;&#10;Q: How do you move the 'dungeon mats' with glasses on them?&#10;A: It is advised to remove the glasses while a row or column of 'dungeon mats' is being moved.&#10;&#10;Q: What happens if i am on a 'dungeon mat' that is pushed out the dungeon?&#10;A: The player is moved onto the 'dungeon mat' that was just inserted on the other side of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Q: Players have blocked the 'treasure room' or are holding a 'dungeon mat' or 'magic mat&rsquo;?&#10;A: Don&rsquo;t let a player get all the 'magic mats' as there are spells that help with these situations. Read the magic mats carefully before playing the game.&#10;&#10;Q: I have picked up another 'dungeon mat' from a dead player?&#10;A: You may now choose either of your 'dungeon mat' to insert during your turn.&#10;&#10;"

Play as a power-hungry drug dealer trying to get rich quick. Deliver goods to your customers but watch out for the cops and rival dealers. They&rsquo;ll try to take you down as you negotiate, bribe, and scheme your way to the top. Make the most money before time&rsquo;s up, and you win!&#10;&#10;The board is your block. To move forward, you&rsquo;ll move your game piece around the sidewalk clockwise. You&rsquo;ll also find a road that the cops drive on, a jail in the middle of the board, and apartments where you will deliver drugs. Your game piece moves based on the white die and the Cop Car moves based on the black die. The person who most recently did drugs goes first.&#10;&#10;There are four drugs in the game: Weed, Molly, Coke, and Shrooms. Before the game begins, you&rsquo;ll select one type of drug. There are four Suppliers on the board &mdash; one for each type of drug. Suppliers sell you drugs, which you&rsquo;ll then sell at a higher price to your Clients for a profit. Each player has one Supplier from which they buy their designated drug exclusively. You can buy baggies of your designated drug for $10 each from your Supplier every time you land on, or pass over, your Supplier&rsquo;s tile. You may buy as much as you can afford.&#10;&#10;You&rsquo;ll receive a Text Message card every time you land on or pass over, a notification tile. There are two types - those from Clients who would like to buy drugs (this will include which drugs they want, how many baggies, and which apartment to deliver them to), and those from Informants who give you advantages throughout the game.&#10;&#10;To sell drugs:&#10;&#10;     Pass over, or land on, your Client&rsquo;s apartment (indicated by their Text Message).&#10;     Burn Text Message card.&#10;     Discard sold drugs to the box.&#10;     Pick up $50 per drug sold from the box.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is a Cop Car that travels around the board trying to bust dealers. If at any point, you have possession of drugs and the Cop Car lands on the adjacent tile to your game piece, you&rsquo;ll go to Jail. (You will only be arrested if you&rsquo;re in possession of drugs.)&#10;&#10;There are two ways to avoid being arrested:&#10;&#10;     Bribe the Cops with $50. (The money should be put back into the box.)&#10;     Blackmail the cops with an appropriate Text Message from an Informant.&#10;&#10;&#10;If you go to Jail, you must discard all of your drugs and weapons. To get out, you must complete a loop around the Jail with your game piece.&#10;&#10;If on your turn, you land on a tile shared by another dealer&rsquo;s game piece, you have the option to rob your friend, potentially stealing their drugs. Both players roll one die (the number you roll represents your Attack Strength), and the highest Attack Strength wins.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you may buy weapons - Brass Knuckles, a Switchblade, and/or a Pistol. Weapons increase your Attack Strength during a robbery. You can continue to use your weapons until they&rsquo;re confiscated by the police.&#10;&#10;You can also buy an Associate. Associates follow you around the board, allowing you to increase your attack strength during a robbery and increase your movement around the board by +1.&#10;&#10;On their respective turns, players may trade Text Messages, drugs, weapons, or cash. There are no rules around trading &mdash; all is fair in love and drugs. If, at any point, you run out of cash, you&rsquo;re out.&#10;&#10;When time is up, each player is given one last turn, starting with the first player of the game. When the last player completes their turn, each dealer should count how much cash they have. If you have a weapon, or unsold drug baggies, you may liquidate them for the price you paid. Once each player has tallied their liquidated assets and cash, the player with the highest total wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Endless wars are taking their toll as the people fall into despair. There is no hope for an end, no prospects for a peaceful order. The faith of the people slowly burns out. Dorment Spirits of the Nations wake up from centuries-long rest, rekindling the hearts of the people and raising ancient warriors called the Titans. People, filled with extraordinary powers, standing hand-by-hand with mighty Titans, fight to reclaim Europe. That war will end it all, and a King of Kings will be chosen.&#10;&#10;In Titans players take roles of a king that leads an Army with a mythical Titan into Battle. There are 4 Nations to choose from, one of the European empires of that time - Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around a unique, yet simple Order Card Mechanics. Players will use a shared deck of Order Cards that will allow them to recruit Units, awake the Nation&rsquo;s Power and move their Armies across the Game Board. Players draw a specific number of Order Cards and place them face-up for all players to see. Players also see the upcoming Order Cards so they can plan their long=term strategy.  In his turn, the active player chooses 1 of the available Order Cards and uses it's available Actions. Players will try to gain strategic positions, move their front line and attack their opponents where they are the weakest. The next player uses the same Pool of Order Cards so the active player may try to anticipate opponents movement and use that to their advantage. When there is only 1 Order Card available it's discarded, the &quot;upcoming Order Cards&quot; become the available pool and new Order Cards are drawn. That allows for dynamic gameplay with a lot of planning, both tactical and strategical.&#10;&#10;The game is divided into Rounds and the Round ends after the Order Deck is empty. After each Round players collect Victory Points for the Regions they control, so players constantly want to expand their domain. Winning Battles also bring players Victory Points so deciding when, where and how to attack is crucial as well. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
