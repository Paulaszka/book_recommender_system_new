Stud games are also typically non-positional games, meaning that the player who bets first on each round may change from round to round (it is usually the player whose face-up cards make the best hand for the game being played). The cards dealt face down to each individual player are called hole cards, which gave rise to the common English expression ace in the hole for any hidden advantage.&#10;&#10;Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or streets, with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, seven-card stud, deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.&#10;&#10;Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.&#10;&#10;"

The pieces are used to compose equalities and the game rewards you with more points for better combinations (numbers with more digits, using division or multiplication, using a piece already on the table).&#10;&#10;"

Players load the suction cup dart into a shooter that resembles a small wooden bat with a central hole. The shooter has a rubber band stretched over the dart end to fire the dart at the targets.&#10;&#10;American Games (A. Malloy) lists the game as being published in 1939.&#10;&#10;"

A parody of 2016 Lithuanian Parliament election.&#10;&#10;You are the leader of a political party which has 10 members. There are only two months left until the elections and events occur every day leaving no time for rest. On your road to success you will deal with social, economic and internal events and of course you will be part of scandals. By successfully resolving an event you will obtain rating points however by being part of a scandal you will lose them. You will be able to exchange rating points to the control of ministries and that will determine who will rule &Scaron;eimas.&#10;&#10;In &Scaron;eimas as well as in Seimas (Lithuanian Parlament) the elections is the time for challenges.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the back of the box (translated)&#10;&#10;Each player has 10 party member cards. Each party member has positive or negative competence points in each of the four fields (economic, internal affairs, social and scandals). The five event cards are picked, which represent an event happening each day of the working week. Events might be positive (economic, internal affairs or social) or negative (scandal). One event is opened and players bid party member to win (resolve) the event or not to be part of a scandal. Winning the event gains you rating points, which can be combined to obtain the control of ministries. By participating in a scandal players lose rating points, which can lead to losing the control of ministries. After the week ends (fifth event is resolved), played party members are returned to the player and the new week is started. The game is finished after two in-game months (8 weeks or 40 events) or when one player controls at least 7 (out of 14) ministries. The winner is the player who controls ministries which required most rating points to obtain.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;Politin&#196;&#151;s satyros &#197;&#190;aidimas. 2016 m Lietuvos Seimo rinkim&#197;&#179; parodija.&#10;&#10;J&#197;&#171;s vadovaujate partijai ir de&scaron;im&#196;&#141;iai jos rinktini&#197;&#179; nari&#197;&#179;.

They then receive a hand of cards, the order of which they cannot change. The start player for a round leads by playing a combination of up to three cards, and these cards must be next to one another in that player's hand. A player can lay down a single card, a pair, a triple, or a run of two or three consecutive cards. Each player in turn must beat the combination, with a pair being beaten by a higher pair or a triple. If you cannot or will not play, you instead pick up one of your reserve cards, placing it where you choose within your hand. If you have no more reserve cards, then you must discard a life token.&#10;&#10;Once each player has played or passed, whoever played the highest combination wins that round and begins the next round. If a player must discard a life token but has none, this player loses the game and everyone else wins.&#10;&#10;Combo Up includes four new special action cards, but is otherwise identical in gameplay to the original release.&#10;&#10;"

You will choose the actions for each of your armies that will in turn, change the shape of the land and the outcome of the game.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game of Resilience is played with 2 to 4 players, each attempting to be the first to build a level 4 stronghold and become the winner of the game. The levels of a stronghold are as follows: 1-Keep 2-Wall 3-Moat 4-Victory&#10;&#10;The Game Board: The game is played on square land tiles that are laid down between the player's war camps. The land tiles are one of three types, Desert, Plains or Forest, each having a different land value associated with them. The more land value a player controls, the higher they can build their stronghold to win the game.&#10;&#10;Some of the land tiles have mountains that limit where a player's commander can move to and may be rotated by the players to alter the game board, benefiting or hindering a player's strategy.&#10;&#10;Game-Play: Each player has 3 commanders that they use to move around the game board and interact with the land tiles. On each player's turn, they may use each commander once to claim land tiles, use special abilities or battle opponent commanders.&#10;&#10;Battle: Each commander has an army that is made up of 1 to 3 army cards. Army cards may be; Infantry, Archer, Cavalry or a Diplomat. In a Rock-Paper-Scissor fashion each player reveals cards, one at a time, from the commander army to battle: Infantry beats Cavalry, Cavalry beats Archer, Archer beats Infantry. The diplomat serves as the wild-card; when used in battle, both players are forced to roll a 6-sided die to determine the victor of that particular fight.&#10;&#10;Trading: Players may trade away land tiles they control to other willing players, and in return, they re-collect army cards that have been discarded or resurrect fallen commanders.&#10;&#10;Fun fact: No player can truly be eliminated. Even if a player looses all of their commanders and land tiles, they can always accept trade from other players, bringing them back into the game.&#10;&#10;"
