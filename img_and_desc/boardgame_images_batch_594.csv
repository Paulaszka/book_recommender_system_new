These farmers have long used a sophisticated irrigation system to organize rice cultivation by integrating religious devotion and social responsibility with traditional farming methods. Even modern farmers seek to placate the spirit world in their quest to produce an abundant harvest.&#10;&#10;In Spirits of the Rice Paddy, players must compete with fellow rice farmers to construct and tend rice paddies. Oxen can build walls and remove large rocks. Ducks can be employed to eat harmful pests and fertilize the fledgling crops. Weeds must be kept at bay. Most importantly, water must be conserved and released with the greatest of care. With a little luck, all that back-breaking labor will pay off in the end. The good news is that the spirits are eager to assist, granting many special abilities, blessings, and magic. The farmer who produces the most rice over seven rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

Quickly, everyone left town as fast as they could heading toward a &quot;Quarantine Zone&quot; they heard of in Boulder, Colorado. You and a small group of other survivors got the last wagon in town and headed to Boulder. It wasn't long before the wagon broke catastrophically and you were all stranded.

The game is played with two sets of unique six-sided dice. The first set of five dice have six different role-playing attributes on them such as strength or charisma. The other set of dice represent the six different types of jobs the heroes in your party can have based on the attributes they rolled. There are also Fool dice for characters that could not get a job.&#10;&#10;On the first four turns, players will roll the five attribute dice up to 3 times in an attempt to give one of their four heroes a job (such as rolling at least three strength to create a Barbarian, or two intelligence and two charisma to create a Summoner). Among the six available job dice there are 24 unique jobs (and one more for the unique Fool Die) to play with.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has rolled up their individual parties of four, they have a competition against a deck of cards that represents monsters and traps in a dungeon. They do this by drawing the top card of the dungeon deck and rolling the dice representing their party up to three times against the numbers and tricks on the card. The player is trying to roll enough damage to defeat the monster and enough blocking or healing to stop as much damage as possible. Traps works slightly differently with the party trying to disarm them with either job dice that can do so, or by trying to roll various specific combinations of attribute Dice to manually disarm them. Once they make their final roll for the turn they add up the numbers and see what they scored.&#10;&#10;The competition is score based with a very simple system. Players gain 1 point for killing monsters and disarming traps, and another point if they can end the turn having blocked or healed all the damage that monster or trap just did. If a player can both defeat a card and block or heal all the damage in the same turn they gain 3 points instead.&#10;&#10;"

We have put together a little information that might help giving players a better experience with the game. &#10;Hopefully, this will help improving the enjoyment of the game.&#10;&#10;The most essential part of the game is the Space Shop. It must be used or the game will become boring and you are left with a feel of just chasing one another without any tactical considerations. The Space Shop adds strategic/tactical depth to the game.&#10;&#10;The game is about making tough decisions figuring out when it will pay off to sell cards and thus earning credits for purchases. When and where you place field equipment is of the utmost importance. Failing at placing your field equipment the right place can cost you the game. Like in chess you must carefully consider your next moves and in accordance to your plan, buy and place field equipment. Credits are not easy to come by, so be sure not to buy field equipment without having carefully planned out a strategy on how to use the field equipment. &#10;Do not expect to keep a favorite weapon throughout the whole game (although it is possible). At a certain point you may have to give it up&#10;&#10;Here are a few hints:&#10;Gravitational Enforcers are among other things used for preventing a melee-heavy agents from catching up to you.&#10;&#10;Space Tunnels are used to travel vast distances and thus ensuring that enemy agents will not get too far away from you. Keeping them within your reach.&#10; Sentries are very useful to the agents as they give you more fire power. Placed correctly you can cut off fleeing agents or blow down walls  that enemy agents may use as a defensive barrier trying to buy a little time. But placing sentries randomly is just a waste of credits/cards.&#10;&#10;Melee weapons. If you are not a really experienced player, you should not only go for strength and melee weapons. As a beginner you should go for precision and intellect and later in the game , you could attempt using the melee weapons as a support weapon.&#10;&#10;The game. &#10;IPA - The Agents is a tactical strategy game that takes place in a near future. You take on the roll as one of the agents of &quot;the agency&quot;, who fight other agents in an attempt to find rare objects to his/her employer.&#10;&#10;Among many other things the game includes 200 playing cards of which 145 are distinctly different.  These cards are both used as items for in-game fights and they are also used as the currency of the game. The currency can be spend on buying equipment that is placed physically on the gameboard or for buying temporary boosts for your agent.  All cards are valuable in one way or another and you must wisely choose how to use them. This gives an economic aspect to the game as the number of cards at your disposal is limited. &#10; There are small roleplaying elements in the game that make sure that you cannot use an especially powerful  card early in the game. This mechanic is made to reduce the agony of an unbalanced game.  &#10;To strengthen the replay value of the game, the obstacles (walls) of the game are placed on the gameboard before the game starts. This is incorporated into the beginning of the game as a strategic element which ensures that the gameboard looks different every time you play.&#10;&#10;There are alternative rules that among other things varies the luck factor of the game. Gamers have different needs when it comes to the luck factor. Now they have the opportunity to adjust the luck factor so it meets with their needs.&#10;&#10;We have experimented with a new kind of artform. Every picture is a uniquely hand painted painting made by a Danish artist.&#10;&#10;There are many tutorials on our website and we try to make tutorials on request from our fans, if we find a need for it.&#10;&#10;The game may look complex, but most players get into the mechanics/dynamics quickly. When we attended the boardgame fair at Essen 2013, we saw that most players had understood and gotten into the mechanics after only 5-6 turns into the game.&#10;&#10;We are in the Beta phase of a new game mode called &quot;Vampiric Elite&quot;, which &quot;kills&quot; the player-elimination&quot; part of the game. All players stay in the game until it ends, thus dealing with &quot;Player Elimination&quot; that some people do not like. Instead the winner is found by a unique point system that awards being a good, but somewhat aggressive, tactician. You must be able to deal the most damage possible while staying aloof of enemy attacks. The whole point system is monitored by the agents' life.&#10;In this game mode it is possible for up to 8 players to participate.&#10;&#10;Don't miss out on a tactical treat.&#10;&#10;"

They are meant to be carry-on or gifts, suitable for children (&quot;Mitbringspiel&quot;). Some of the cubes contain actual games, others contain magic tricks, puzzles etc.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 28 double-sided cards. &#10;On their turn, players must choose a design from the cards in the middle of the table. Each card indicates how many copies of that design are in the game.  Then they must try to find all copies of that design, one by one. If they do (without revealing any wrong card), they get those cards and then they must place them by the other side before them. So, when a player chooses a design from the middle of the table that has a copy in front of another player then he steals that card. The game will end when there are no more cards in the middle of the table. The winner is the player with the most cards.&#10;&#10;"

A ground war with the aliens seems inevitable as the first waves of enemies approach. Players take the role of weapons development companies seeking a contract with the Earth Defense Force.&#10;&#10;Defeating aliens gets you brownie points, but sloppy work will let the next player sweep up the wounded remains. Balance subterfuge and self-promotion while blowing up aliens to claim ultimate victory!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=========The game is comprised of multiple player rounds over the course of three waves of invading aliens, with the starting player rotating between each. At the start of each round, cards can be played to give an advantage or disadvantage to yourself or other players for the duration of the round. Most player-to-player sabotage happens at this time, so players go into their turns aware of what odds might be stacked against them.&#10;&#10;Once a round has begun, players each do the following as a complete turn:&#10;&#10;- Receive energy tokens and event cards;&#10;- Commit energy tokens to their weapons;&#10;- Use event cards for their action, or as currency for upgrading weapons or hiring employees;&#10;- Fire charged weapons into a 3x3 grid of aliens.&#10;&#10;Each weapon has its own targeting system and damage types, with stronger weapons needing more energy to fire. Each alien has their own Rock-Paper-Scissors style strengths and weaknesses against damage types.&#10;&#10;Players keep alien corpses for end-game points, but can trade them for additional event cards on the Black Market. Weapon upgrades and employees also provide points at the end of the game, but on a handicap system - more points are awarded for weaker weapons or poor employees, awarding clever strategy over pure luck.&#10;&#10;The game typically ends when the Wave III deck empties and the 3x3 grid can no longer be stocked, but there are a few conditions where all players lose if they can't coordinate their efforts well enough!&#10;&#10;"

Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other.&#10;&#10;How to play&#10;&#10;Each wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more &quot;Greedy&quot; than &quot;Gandalf&quot;, their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an &ldquo;absolutely massive chicken&rdquo; or &ldquo;a woman who shouts hurricanes.&#10;&#10;Players take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs.&#10;&#10;However, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?&#10;&#10;Beautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, it&rsquo;s a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player. As long as they are greedy.&#10;&#10;"
