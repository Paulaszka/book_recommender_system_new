America's Complete Hand-Book of Games, containing all the card games played in the United States, with their rules, regulations, technicalities, etc., adapted to the American mode of playing, from the text of Hoyle, and the best modern authorities. Also comprising Backgammon, Chess, Checkers, Billiards, Pool, Bagatelle, Bowls, etc., with numerous diagrams and engravings. Complete edition. Revised, corrected, and enlarged.&quot;&#10;&#10;One confusing aspect about this book is that there is no trademark on the name Hoyle (just like there is no trademark on the name Webster's for dictionaries), so referring to a book as Hoyle's Games could refer to a number of different volumes.  The popular Hoyle's Games was first published in 1907, with at least ten editions published in the twentieth century.

15684,,"SGB-1 Mist of the Ardennes (1983) (JPY 1500) &#10;Mist of the Ardennes covers the Battle of the Bulge. The first 26 pgs are devoted to the battle, while the next eleven pgs are actual rules and the final ten pgs cover the charts, table, set-ups, etc. that come with a game. &#10;The map is in two pieces, each 11x17&rdquo; and looks amazingly like SPI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wacht Am Rhein&rdquo; that I can see (my copy is MINT and I refuse to open it all up), including coloring and style. Judging by the fact that the game lasts five days of the campaign (the 16th to 20th of Dec) and the units included (no SS, but the 2nd PZ and Lehr Pz Divisions), I would guess that the game covers the opening assault by the 5th Panzer Army against Clervaux and the 28th US infantry division. &#10;The game has battalion-sized units almost exclusively. Units have only one combat number and some sort of morale or training rating as there are several units with one or two stars between the combat and movement numbers. The main thing is that the game uses strength points reduction-there are roster sheets for record-keeping of unit losses. The CRT is by strength point loss and there is a detailed chart for CRT modifiers, presumably for combined arms. Also, next to the strength point boxes are a number of boxes for each unit for each day. I would gather that the game tracks unit fatigue as well. There are barrage and range values on artillery and support and range numbers on the regimental HQ units.&#10;&#10;"

The map does not use full-hex terrain symbols but does include a vast array of set-up boxes for the different clans involved. &#10;As its name implies, this is a alternative history of the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The counters have a combat and movement value with some of the troops having their combat number in parenthesis (the musket-armed troops I bet, but there does seen to be a lot of them). There is a neat time spiral in the middle of a roster page (what is recorded there, I have no idea), as the CRT is a &lsquo;push-style&rsquo; one, with the results of &lsquo;AD&rsquo;, &lsquo;AR&rsquo; &lsquo;Eng&rsquo;, &lsquo;DR&rsquo; and &lsquo;DD&rdquo;.

Many of the rules cover the interaction of the markers on the PACs during combat. I imagine most of the &lsquo;game&rsquo; here is managing your PAC correctly vis-&agrave;-vis the map.&#10;&#10;Other counters include DD tanks, commandos, coastal artillery, strong points, naval bombardment and TAC air markers and a whole handful with Japanese text (which is somewhat rare in Japanese games actually).&#10;&#10;This game is way up on my list of games needing translation.

15696,,"This game covers the Crusader battles.&#10;&#10;On December 9, 1940, British forces launched Operation Compass, forcing the withdrawal of Italian forces from North Africa. In February 1941, Hitler decided to dispatch the German Afrika Korps to North Africa. Rommel's Afrika Korps immediately launched a counterattack, encircling Tobruk in Libya. On the other hand, the British army launches &quot;Operation Crusader&quot; with the aim of liberating Tobruk. In November-December 1941, the two armies began to clash.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Desert battles are similar to naval battles. There is no clear front line, and it becomes a mobile battle. Rather than the size of the occupied land, the strength of the defeated enemy is the issue. It is designed to reproduce it.&rdquo;&#10;These are the words of designer Ginichiro Suzuki, which is written in the introduction. This work, a war simulation game released by Epoch Rec Company, is based on the concept of enjoying the true fun of maneuver warfare by hiding troops, which is rare in ground warfare.&#10;In producing the new edition, we respected the content of the original publication in 1981, but made clarifications where necessary. In addition, regarding changes related to game balance, &quot;selection rules&quot; are adopted in the rules.&#10;&#10;Scale:&#10;&#10;     1 hex = about 3 km&#10;     1 unit = brigade, regiment, battalion&#10;&#10;&#10;Number of players = 2&#227;&#128;&#128;&#10;Play time = about 240 minutes&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;    240 counters (13.5mm square)&#10;    1 A1 size map&#10;    1 rulebook (16 pages)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;First edition was game III in Series: World War Game (Epoch).&#10;Reprinted as an issue game of Command Magazine Japan #158 in 2021.&#10;&#10;(from Command Japan translated and user's description)&#10;&#10;"

15702,,"&quot;Samas&quot; is a simple abstract 2-player racing game that incorporates a &quot;Paper-Scissors-Stone &quot; mechanic to determine which player is allowed to move on the track towards the finishing space.&#10;&#10;The board consists of a single track with 9 hollows. Each player places their Sama-stone on the second hole from their baseline. Both players also get 13 stones in their color, and 2  joker-stones. All these stones are kept hidden behind the player's screens.&#10;&#10;Every turn each player secretly selects 0 to 3 regular stones, or a joker-stone. These are then simultaneously revealed, the Sama-stone of the player with the winning selection moves one place towards the opponent's side, and the stone-selection of both players are removed from play.&#10;&#10;If both players reveal the same stone-selection, then these stones are still removed from play, but neither Sama-stone gets moved forwards. If a player runs out of stones then the opponent's Sama-stone moves 1 space forwards for each regular stone still in this player's reserve.&#10;&#10;So what makes a winning selection? A selection of regular stones gets beaten by a higher amount of regular stones. A joker-stone beats any amount of regular stones. However, if a joker-stone is played when the opponent decided to play no stones at all, than it in turn is beaten.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player reaches the opposite side of the board, or until a player runs out of stones to play. The winner is predictably the player who reaches, or gets closest to, the other side of the board.&#10;&#10;Publishing history: Together with &quot;Trio Trio&quot;, &quot;Samas&quot; was the first of Frank's designs to get published (in 2004) in the deluxe wooden format that typifies the Clemens Gerhards range. Up until then Frank Stark had been making mainly card games, &quot;Zoom&quot; being the only boardgame that had found a (different) publisher. However, since then Frank Stark's boardgame designs have become regular additions to the Clemens Gerhards stable, all in the same high-quality make-up that they do so well.&#10;&#10;"

A team has 3 stacks of cups (the size and shape of typical party cups) that are positioned about 1 foot apart. To begin you must make 3 pyramids, one at a time, with your 3 stacks (2 outer 3-cup pyramids and a central 6-cup one). You must then convert each pyramid back down to the original stacks of cups. The first person to finish down-stacking wins. If a pyramid collapses while it is being built, it must be corrected before moving on to the next. However, if a fumble occurs during the down-stacking process, you may continue to down stack without having to rebuild the pyramid.

15722,,"Belote is probably the most played game in France, essentially by adults (youngsters will probably play the &quot;coinche&quot; variant or Tarot during high school).&#10;&#10;It has been known since around 1930 in France, and is played as a family game or as a gambling game (even if the latter has been prohibited in bistros).&#10;A 32-card deck is needed (that means a poker deck without cards 2 &ndash; 6 and without jokers). &#10;Belote is a point-trick taking game for 4 players.&#10;&#10;Players forms teams of 2. Partners sit at opposite seats.&#10;The dealer gives everybody 3 cards face down, then 2.&#10;After that, the first card of the deck is turned face up. Its suit will serve as trumps.&#10;Then, each player announces whether they will take this card or not. If a player takes it, they receive the face-up card. Then the dealer deals 3 cards to everyone except the taker, who receives only two. That makes for 8 cards for everyone.&#10;If no player takes the card, we take another round were each player announces if they take the card, but also announce the suit that will serve as trumps if they do (instead of the suit of the face-up card).&#10;&#10;After that, it is similar to Tarot: First player plays a card, then each player can play a card of the same suit or a trump. If you can't play the led suit, you have to play a trump. If your partner wins the &quot;pli&quot; (trick), you don't have to play a trump.&#10;When 8 &quot;plis&quot; have been played (when no one has cards in their hand), points are counted. The team with the most points win.&#10;&#10;Point values for the cards each partnership has taken in tricks:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Trump suit &#10;&#10;         Point Value&#10;&#10;         Other suits&#10;&#10;         Point Value &#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         J &#10;&#10;         20&#10;&#10;         A&#10;&#10;         11&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         9&#10;&#10;         14&#10;&#10;         10&#10;&#10;         10&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         A&#10;&#10;         11&#10;&#10;         K&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         10&#10;&#10;         10&#10;&#10;         Q&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         K&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;         J&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Q&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;         9&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         8&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         8&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         7&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         7&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;Variants:&#10;&#10;     La coinche (belote coinch&eacute;e, belote bridg&eacute;e) in which everyone is dealt all the cards and player bids the number of points they're going to make.

Each player takes 4 Match-Ups from the draw pile, and another is placed in the center of the table to start. On your turn, you try to match the color and letters on one of your Match-Ups with the tiles on the table; for example, you might match up a yellow &quot;B&quot; on one end of your tile to a table tile with a yellow &quot;ook&quot; forming the word &quot;Book&quot;. If you cannot make a match, you take a new tile from the draw pile. Because the tiles are curved, as the game progresses large letter loops are formed. Play all your Match-Ups first and win the game.&#10;&#10;"
