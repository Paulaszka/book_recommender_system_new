Players may choose from one of six golf courses identified in the accompanying brochure: Concord, Greenbrier, Torrey Pines, Canyon Country Club, Indian Wells, and La Costa. Each course is listed along with the yards to each hole and the par.&#10;&#10;Each roll of the dice counts as a stroke and all shots are recorded on the included score sheet. Rolling doubles allows a player to roll again, possibly holing the shot.&#10;&#10;The box bottom has a felt liner to allow players to quietly roll dice on those long airplane trips to the links!&#10;&#10;"

The game board represents the planet Elkos and is broken up into a series of hexes with four different types of terrain: Flatlands, Rough, High plateaus, and bunkers.&#10;&#10;There are four different types of pieces corresponding to the four Elkosian &quot;races&quot; of the planet. The Etons move in a straight line and are blocked by anything but flat terrain. The Artilla Squads also move in a straight line, but may traverse flatlands and rocky terrain. The winged Ariel Bombers may traverse any terrain, but fly short distances - they also carry bombs to bombard the opponents. Finally, the Dominator Lord (one per side) moves up to three hexes but may not ascend plateaus. Its special ability however is to convert any opposing piece to its side by moving next to it.&#10;&#10;An interesting twist to the game is that the game board may be altered through the use of bombs. When a bomb is dropped, the owning player may use one of 14 &quot;tri-hexes&quot; to alter the landscape, thereby making previously impassable terrain passable.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either the opposing Dominator Lord is killed, one side no longer has pieces other than the Dominator Lord to move, or a stalemate is reached.&#10;&#10;Game components are mostly card stock, three color printing on the board.&#10;&#10;"

Each line has one or more red circles on it. On each turn, the track-laying player chooses one of three available cards to add to the board, extending or blocking a track. The opponent then rolls the die and moves that many circles on the track. The escaping player may double back on subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;Scoring is simply the number of cards the first player was able to place before the opponent escaped from the board. Players alternate positions for subsequent rounds. A game is usually five rounds.&#10;&#10;"

The player with 5 pieces may not choose the exact pair in front of the screen of the other player (either one may be chosen, but not both pieces).  The chosen pieces are simultaneously revealed, and put in front of the player screens.&#10;&#10;Resolving Movement&#10;&#10;&#10;     No pieces match.

No piece may pass through another piece or share a grid point.&#10;&#10;The player with 4 player pieces in front of his screen now puts all his pieces behind his screen.&#10;&#10;The turn sequence is now repeated with players choosing two of their remaining player pieces, simultaneously revealing them and doing any allowed moves they choose.&#10;Play continues in this way until one or other player wins the game.&#10;&#10;The Story of the Nibelungenlied&#10;&#10;The Nibelungenlied is an epic poem written in Germany about 1200AD, though its sources are far older.  It tells how the peerless prince Siegfried from Xanten in the Netherlands, comes to Worms to court the beautiful Kriemhild.  However, King Gunther and his two brothers jealously guard their sister Kriemhild.  Gunther wishes to win the hand of Brunhild of Iceland, but she will only marry the man who can win three contests against her mighty strength.  Gunther and Siegfried strike a pact, whereby Siegfried will help Gunther win Brunhild's hand and in return he may marry Kriemhild.  Using his magic cloak, Siegfried secretly assists Gunther to defeat Brunhild, both on the field and in the bedchamber.  Unfortunately, Siegfried keeps Brunhild's ring and girdle, and ultimately bestows them upon his wife Kriemhild.  A small grievance leads the queens to fight, the ring and girdle are produced, and Brunhild is humiliated.   She enlists Hagen, the chief vassal of Gunther, to help her get vengeance, and Gunther and Hagen murder Siegfried while out hunting.  Kriemhild swears to exact revenge, marries the recently widowed King Etzel (Attila the Hun) and finally invites Hagen and her brothers to Attila's court, where in a crescendo of battle and blood, everyone dies and honour is redeemed.&#10;&#10;Siegfried and Brunhild are clearly destined for each other, and in older versions of the story he is betrothed to her, but is bewitched away by Kriemhild.  The Natural Order would be that Brunhild is won fairly and that Siegfried may marry any woman that he chooses.  The forces of Tragic Destiny twist the natural order so that Brunhild is tricked by Gunther and Siegfried, or that Hagen and Gunther murder Siegfried to obtain his magic cloak.&#10;&#10;"

Players control a chief and a brave, and have the object of capturing horses and buffalo.  The animal pieces flee when an indian moves adjacent to them, so the trick is to drive them onto your other piece sitting in a stationary ambush or to drive them against an obstacle.  A horse doubles an indian's movement and is required to transport a dead buffalo back to camp.  Combat and theft of animals is permitted.&#10;&#10;Red Cloud's War: for 2 players.  The US Govt player has to keep supply wagons rolling up the trail to Fort Keogh, the Red Cloud player needs to stop the wagons and starve Fort Keogh to surrender.&#10;&#10;Iron Horse: for 2 to 4 players.  Use your surveyors and construction gangs to build your railroad to Central City before the other players.  This would be simple were it not for the Indian tribe which means you have to hire gunmen for protection.  Gunmen can also be used to terrorise other player's workers, or to have a shoot out with another gunman.  Some gunmen are better than others, and all will work for the player offering them the most money!&#10;&#10;Lincoln County War: for 2 players.  Major Murphy and Sherriff Peppin take on Alexander McSween and Billy the Kid.  A real wild west shoot out, with the Kid's gang trying to break through to the Chisum spread before the rifles, pistols and Col. Dudley's Gatling gun mow down McSween or the Kid.&#10;&#10;"

The clue-giver presses a button to reveal each of the 10 items in turn and gives clues to the other player until the word is either guessed, or the clue-giver decides to pass. Passed words may not be revisited later. Once all 10 words have been gone through, or time runs out, each of those two players receive a point for each word that was guessed correctly. The next pair of players are then designated, a new category card is placed into the viewer, and the process is repeated until all of the pairings on the player chart have been completed. This tends to be a balancing factor, since all players get a round where they are paired with the better players, as well as the not-so-good players.&#10;&#10;"

This most useful skill against opponents gave rise to the expression of being in a &quot;Protean struggle.&quot; The Proteus game set is so named because the game can change its form &mdash; not its physical form, but rather the game rules themselves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Michael's concept was to create a meta-game that allowed for rule-changing but had a fixed slate of  rules, unlike the fluid game of Nomic. The rules on 9 wood tiles determine how the players may move their pieces, trade the tiles, or even win. A rule is activated when a player's piece enters a correspondingly shaped tile, and the previously active rule is turned off. A placement phase precedes the movement stage.

7584,,"Most of you will recognize this old classic. It has been re-released several times since its 48' inception. Most of the re-releases revolved around alternate years Super Bowls with the players present from the respective teams ending up in that years game box. This game gave you all the players needed for a full football team on offense and defense and movement bases that allowed particular players to hopefully run particular routes. There was also the triple threat QB. He could pass, punt and kick your field goals. Earlier versions just included a little clicker type device to flip around the ball. Little felt football were included. Game field vibrated with an electric buzzer to set the players in motion. Set up your formations then turn the switch on and off accordingly, adjusting your players as the rules allowed. So what if the game is absolutely impossible to play? The components were enough to keep us all entertained and constantly wanting to pull it out.&#10;&#10;"

Some of the cards are now a bit dated, with references to buying time on the Buddy Deane Show and the Steve Allen Show.&#10;&#10;Luck plays a far greater role than skill, as JZ is a simple roll-and-move game.

NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East imposed the longest peace since the end of the Napoleonic Wars. But as the Cold War ends, this armed stability will end as well. The nations of Europe have many long-standing territorial disputes and historic animosities that only now can erupt into violence. For years, Romania and Hungary could put aside their differences in the face of a greater threat from NATO. Greece and Turkey stood uncomfortably together against the potential threat of the Warsaw Pact.&#10;Now, the age of unsteady friends has passed. Battlefield: Europe explores seven potential European flashpoints. Each could turn violent at any time in the next ten years.&#10;&#10;"
