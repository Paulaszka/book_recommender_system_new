It works like this: Every player gets one of 12 boyfriend photos (these guys are hunks!). Anyway, put the photos in the frames and move around the game board collecting kisses.  When you win a kiss, you use the special 'kisser' stamper to stamp your boyfriend's photo.  But hey, life's not always great, is it?  Sometimes you can lose kisses, take kisses, or even have to trade boyfriends.  The first player to collect five kisses wins the game. It&rsquo;s that easy and tons of fun!&#10;&#10;"

Death and destruction awaits all those in the path of the evil ones.&#10;&#10;In Dark Minions players represent those forces of evil as they try to pillage and destroy towns. Each turn, the players typically roll three dice and may use the resulting numbers to attack Towns to win Vanquish Points (VPs) &ndash; the further along into the game, the more VPs the Towns are worth. Players also attempt to capture Towers in order to level up experience (which enables the player to roll better dice), to re-spawn dead minions from the graveyard, and to &quot;purchase&quot; the services of the various Overlords. In the end, it's all about VPs and the first player to 40 VPs in a four-player game wins.&#10;&#10;The advanced game adds 15 Minion Overlords, each with a unique special power that may affect the play or the outcome of the game.

It incorporates ease of play, a simple ratings system and simple charts. Hundreds of simulated seasons are run, ensuring the accuracy of each Fastscore season while factoring in each team&rsquo;s strength of schedule.&#10;&#10;Although the ratings seem simple, there is a great deal of background information packed into each rating. This game uniquely takes into account the offensive and defensive styles of each team by separating scoring frequency and scoring ability. For example, some teams may score frequently, but fail to execute in the red zone- thus adding points to the board with field goals more frequently than touchdowns. Others may rarely score but efficiently march into the endzone- thus scoring more touchdowns than field goals.   Additionally, offensive and defensive strengths in the running and passing game are reflected in the ratings and will influence the score of the game.  For example, teams with strong defenses against the run will more effectively shut down teams that rely on the running game.  And in close games, give your team a fighting chance by going for a 2-pt conversion!&#10;&#10;With Fastscore football, teams will perform similarly to their real-life stats in points for and against, touchdowns for and against, field goals for and against, and most importantly, their win-loss record.  These stats are fine-tuned to a 250-season average typically within 10 points of actual, and within 2 TDs and FGs of actual.  Strength of schedule is factored into the ratings to ensure the utmost in accuracy.&#10;&#10;And the best part: we&rsquo;ve included the as-played schedule for each season! And we didn&rsquo;t stop there- we know that your time is valuable, so we&rsquo;ve calculated the final team ratings for each game on the schedule- taking into account home field advantage and the run/pass ratings- so you don&rsquo;t have to do the calculations yourself.  Just sit back, roll the dice and mark down the score of the game.&#10;&#10;Fastscore Football is played using two differently colored 6-sided dice. Each team has seven ratings representing offensive and defensive abilities and a clutch rating. Better ratings are color coded in green while worse ratings are color coded in red. Higher offense ratings represent teams with punishing offenses. Lower defense ratings represent teams that effectively shut down their opponents.&#10;&#10;If you play Fastscore as a stand-alone game, you can finish a season replay in a few hours! You can also use Fastscore Football as a complement to detailed, play by play games. If you are enjoying a single team replay, play your favorite team&rsquo;s games with your favorite football game while playing out the other games on the schedule with Fastscore, and see how your team is doing in the standings! A week&rsquo;s worth of games can be completed in less than 15 minutes!&#10;&#10;Fastscore offers great value for the gamer. Each Fastscore set includes multiple seasons for one low price! We intend to rate every season from current day to the seasons of yesteryear.&#10;&#10;Each season includes: &#10;&#10;    Rules of the game&#10;    Scoring Charts&#10;    Team Ratings Chart&#10;    As-Played Schedule with pre-calculated game ratings for each team&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Eight actions are available and they're divided into four types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    City: (1) buy a saline and (2) buy a building&#10;    Navigation: (1) travel to the ocean and fish and (2) travel to Rouen&#10;    Harbor: (1) build a ship and (2) move goods&#10;    Market: (1) sell to the market and (2) buy from the market&#10;&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he can take any one of the either actions or pass; the cost of an action is the number of times this type of action has been performed previously during this round. For example, the first use of a City action costs 0, while the next use (whether to buy a saline or a building) costs 1. A player who passes can take an action later in the same phase. The action phase ends once all players pass. A player can go into debt during a turn, paying one coin in interest when doing so; as long as the player is in the black once the action round ends (by selling to the market), no further payment is due.&#10;&#10;In the turn end phase, players produce salt, may use special buildings, pay interest (if needed), reset the cost of the actions to zero, and so on. A player can have no more than 40 coins at the end of a turn unless he owns a banque, and the limit is 80 coins without owning Salle des Coffres. This limit is important as the player with the most coins after five rounds wins. Some buildings provide endgame bonuses to which the coin limit doesn't apply.&#10;&#10;"

The other players try to make a match by writing who they think is the best boy for the first player and why. Then, each of the other players take turns revealing who they chose as her match. After the first player reveals her response, scores are tabulated for that round. Each player who correctly matches the first player's response scores a point.
