In Freshwater Fly you will encounter a rushing mountain stream teaming with fish, armed solely with a rod, reel and selection of flies. To catch fish and earn valuable achievement points you will need to carefully perform a series of tactical maneuvers while executing a deliberate and evolving strategy.&#10;&#10;Begin by examining the ever-changing hatch in the current, and tie a fly to match your target fish at just the right time and turn of the river. Then choose to cast upstream to drift your fly with the current and gain extra bites on your line, or push your luck with a pinpointed cast for the perfect catch. In either case, it is wise to cast near rocks to boost your skill and uncover new fishing techniques, while keeping your supply of finesse charged for the next challenge. Your rondel reel, which physically spins, provides you different bonuses as you draw in your line, depending on how aggressively you choose to fight the fish you've hooked. Applying drag, for instance, will negate the fish's strength, but leveraging your momentum could provide you a unique action to set you up perfectly for your next cast.&#10;&#10;At its core, Freshwater Fly is a dice drafting and set collecting game, with elements of creative puzzle solving and pushing your luck. Each turn you select one die from the dice pool and assign it an action that relates to the particular fishing maneuver you want to take. Higher valued dice typically earn you more powerful actions, but accumulating lower dice totals can earn you free turns. The dice you select will also unlock or multiply various bonus actions you can use to solve the most stringent fishing puzzles in unique and rewarding ways.&#10;&#10;The sets of fish and flies you collect will help you achieve personal and common goals, but to obtain victory you must focus on those goals which overlap in the most valuable ways, while not falling behind in your total fish count. The game ends when a single player catches a seventh fish, achievement points are awarded, and the winner is declared.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

As in many such games, the players invest in railroad companies, building track to increase the company&rsquo;s income and paying dividends to the shareholders. And as in several of Amabel Holland&rsquo;s railroad games, track-leasing and cooperation is required to get past high build costs, strict hex limits, and tight cube supplies.&#10;&#10;Here&rsquo;s the thing, though: this is a weird game. For one thing, there are only three railroads to invest in, and the majority shareholder makes all decisions when a company operates. This means that when playing with four or five, some players will not be running companies themselves, and will need to rely on savvy investments to stay competitive. Included in these investments are five Private Companies. Privates are seeded with goods at the start of the game and pay a fixed income each round, and each time a railroad delivers goods. Once their goods are gone, the Private closes and the owner derives no further benefit.&#10;&#10;If a railroad withholds money instead of paying dividends, its share value drops, sometimes drastically. Given enough time, the stock values for all three railroads will tank - the trick is to end the game before that happens, and when you have the most valuable portfolio. As is usually the case in these kinds of things, the winner is the player with the most money - cash on hand plus the value of your stocks. (Note, however, that no play money is provided.

Bonaparte summarized the bleak situation: &quot;The enemy have broken through our line in three places; they are masters of La Corona and Rivoli. Massena has been compelled to yield to superior forces; Sauret has begun his retreat to Desenzano, and the enemy has captured Brescia and the bridge of Ponte San Marco. You see that our communications with Milian are cut off.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ordering Augereau to join him at Roverbella, Bonaparte directed Serurier to raise the siege of Mantova and fall back, to cover the alternate line of communication via Cremona. Although this meant abandoning the precious siege guns, it gave the French the freedom to unite their forces and engage on their own terms, massing against each Austrian wing in turn.&#10;&#10;Staking everything on success, Bonaparte set his forces in motion toward Brescia, leaving a small brigade of 1,500 men at Castiglione to delay three corps of Marshal Wurmser. There was no room for retreat - any reverse would mean utter catastrophe. Bonaparte rode five horses to death, covering 122 kilometers in 42 hours; but the French commander regained the initiative. He routed the Austrians at Lonato, while Wurmser approached Castiglione, a mere five miles away.&#10;&#10;Though he succeeded in turning about and driving Wurmser back into the hills, the contest for Italy was far from over; the Austrian Army would return to hurl themselves against the understrength French forces covering the quadrilateral of fortresses - Verona, Legnano, Peschiera, and the ultimate prize - Mantova.&#10;&#10;Rules: Napoleon at Bay System (48 pages incl. notes)&#10;Quick Set-up Tables: six 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Sheets &amp; Displays&#10;Scenarios: Four (July, September, November 1796 and January 1797&#10;Map: One 22 x 34&quot; section by Joe Youst&#10;Counters: 280 (300 including blanks) two-sided pieces by Masahiro Yamazaki&#10;Game Design: Kevin Zucker&#10;&#10;GAME SYSTEM: CAMPAIGNS System - Series 1X = 3,200m/hex, 1,000 men/SP, 2 days/turn.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Each player represents one of the houses as they fight battles and gain influence to control England.&#10;&#10;The Cousins' War is played over a maximum of five rounds, with each round representing between five and ten years of the conflict. Each round involves gaining influence across England and preparing for a climactic battle.&#10;&#10;In each round, the players decide where the current battlefield will be, playing action cards to deploy troops to the battlefield, while also increasing or decreasing their influence in the regions, after which they fight. Players resolve the battle by engaging in bluff and counter-bluff, using three dice, until only one side has troops remaining on the field. Winning the battle helps to consolidate your house's influence on the board.&#10;&#10;You win The Cousins' War either by dominating all the regions of England or by controlling the most regions at the end of the fifth round.&#10;&#10;2nd Edition is a new version of The Cousins' War with larger components.

During the game the players will scan and explore stars placing them onto the modular board to obtain empire bonuses and strategic resources. These in turn are used to power the various technologies.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, the players will be attacked by the AI controlled Entity which grows stronger as the game proceeds. Left unchecked it will eventually consume the players in a supernova explosion. To defeat the Entity, the players must obtain enough victory points and ancient artifacts while combating its forces.  Combat makes use of a highly strategic dice face-building mechanic allowing players to customize their forces over time.&#10;&#10;Because in survival games each player accumulates their own set of victory points while contributing to the overall total required to defeat the Entity, Nova Solis gives each player a reason to play independently of the group-think that plagues other games with cooperative mechanics. Of course the players can still play cooperatively if desired or settle into exploration mode for a more standard 4X romp.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;&#10;Awards&#10;&#10;&#10;     Finalist at UKGE 2018 Wyvern's lair competition&#10;     Finalist Board Game Design Lab - Design Challenge!&#10;&#10;&#10;"

So you gather followers, fight off enemies and climb the steps to divinity.&#10;&#10;STORY&#10;Realm of the gods: Loki, the trickster god framed Thor in a moment of distraction causing the hammer of Thor to fall on Tyr. Tyr the god who was guarding Yggdrasil, the tree connecting the worlds. Knocked out for a moment Tyr left Yggdrasil ungaurded. An opportunity for mortal viking to climbs the tree and become god. But only those who are worshipped and worthy can become a true god. Beware: when power is up for grabs, competition is an the horizon. And the gods... well they will play their part.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY (AND WIN)&#10;In Valda, every player finishes 5 phases during their turn. As a viking chieftan you roll dice to harvest rare resources for your tribe. Then you scavenge and explore the worlds by drafting and playing cards and actions. Building temples in the different God-domains is an important goal to gain divine abilities and get access to more powerful spells. But beware, enemies can attack you with the weapons of the Gods. Defend yourself and use your resources and shields wisely. Fight and build with honor to receive the grace of the Gods. Which God? That depends on your playing style. You like the aggressive playstyle, then is Surtur your man, you like having many options to eventually use the ultimate combo, then Freya is the one for you, and so on. Having a seat at the table of the most beautiful Asgardian palace beside the likes of Odin and Thor, that is your only goal. By playing cards, using your abilities and building temples you also gain valuable followers. The viking chieftan who has the most followers when the game ends, is worthy enough to climb the world tree Yggdrasil and becomes a God! Oh.. and he also wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
