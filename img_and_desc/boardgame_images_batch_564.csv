It's an area control strategy based on resource use, betting and bluffing. Players take the roles of megacorporations&rsquo; CEOs to enlarge influence and dominance of the world. To do so they must spend resources to get control of cyberpunk freelancers - but it's not as easy as it sounds. The cyberpunks are very hard to control and everyone will try to recruit them. Each player will bet on different resources to get best results.&#10;Future INC. is all about getting control over locations and gathering resources.&#10;Each player starts with the same amount of skyscrapers and tries to expand by building new and capturing or destroying those belonging to other players. Thanks to skyscrapers players gain control over locations &ndash; areas of the cyberpunk world - and gather resources.&#10;&#10;There are five types of resources in the game:&#10;Credits - represent financial capabilities - used to build new skyscrapers.&#10;Cybernetics - represent technological advancement - used to change ownership of enemy skyscrapers to yours.&#10;Gear - represents military potential - used to destroy skyscrapers.&#10;Programs- represent defense against &quot;cyber terrorism&quot; - used to counter enemy actions.&#10;Influence - represents political power and intel &ndash; used to gain an advantage by manipulating game&rsquo;s mechanics.&#10;&#10;The most important thing in Future INC. is using free mercenaries - known as Cyberpunks - to do the dirty work. Using resources, corporation may influence a group of Cyberpunks to capture enemy building and gain victory points.&#10;&#10;Game is divided into five turns, each has three phases:&#10;1st phase, collecting resources: in which players gather resources, determine new targets for Cyberpunks and update points status.&#10;2nd phase, mission: in which players, using bluff, bet on resources to gain control over the Cyberpunks.&#10;3rd phase, actions of corporations: in which players spend resources to perform actions against each other.&#10;Points are gathered by winning control over Cyberpunks and locations. The player with the highest score at the end of the fifth turn wins the game.&#10;&#10;Future INC. High-Tech Stakes is a dynamic strategy for everyone who likes power struggle and a poker-like experience.&#10;&#10;"

Also present are boxes to track each player&rsquo;s hits; in place of ships are (in order of most to least boxes) Capital, Trade and Industry, Air Base, Navy, and Peace.  Each player &ldquo;hides&rdquo; each of these objectives on his own side of the map, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  The Navy must be in the ocean, Peace is a single box that may be anywhere, and the rest must be on land.&#10;&#10;Each player then takes a turn firing volleys at the other side.  A volley consists of 15 bombs, which can be any combination of airplane bombs, rockets, or atomics.  Airplane bombs count for 1 bomb against the limit, rockets for 3, atomics for 5.  Volleys are done all at once, with the opponent not announcing hits until the volley is over.  Players track these developments by crossing off boxes on their paper.  When a player sends a volley, if he has previously received any hits, those hits are subtracted from the 15 bombs he may fire on his current turn.&#10;&#10;Airplane bombs strike only the square called by the player, rockets strike the first square and any two adjoining squares called immediately by the player, and atomics strike the initial square as well as the four adjoining squares along all four sides.  Any target hit on one square by an atomic is immediately destroyed, any target hit by a rocket suffers an additional box hit after what the player targeted.  Should any player strike the target of Peace, the game is immediately over, otherwise the game is won when all of a player&rsquo;s other targets are destroyed.&#10;&#10;"

Now in card game form, no real blood will be spilled, but the strategy, tactics, and power-plays still abound. Based upon a game that exists in the True Blood universe, Night Eternal: The Game is a competitive card game of intrigue, power-plays and betrayal where vampires jockey for power, position and ultimate control of the rival factions: The Authority and The Monarchy.&#10;&#10;Players must ante blood from their pools to both factions each turn of the game. Players build up their hands by acquiring cards from a powerful, but temperamental Immortals deck and a willing and able Agent deck. The cards that a player chooses to play will determine the faction to which he or she is loyal...for now. In turn order, each player plays out one card (face up) during each of three rounds each turn, so you never just how much power it will take to seize control of a faction each turn.&#10;&#10;Players must pay attention to the cards their opponents are playing. It's more difficult to enable a powerful card's special ability if your opponents are playing weaker cards. Weaker card special abilities are easy to resolve, but weakness doesn't win the war. Special abilities might allow a player to steal blood from a faction or move it from one faction to another, so switching your loyalty to a new faction (by playing cards of that faction) might just throw off your opponents' best laid plans.&#10;&#10;In the end, power still rules the day. At the end of each turn (after three rounds of card play), the cards are scored. The player with the highest value of Authority cards earns that faction's blood pool. The player with the highest value of Monarchy cards earns that faction's blood pool. The key to victory is to have more blood tokens than any other player when the first player dies...by running out&#10;of blood.&#10;&#10;"

Finally, the Courthouse allows the player to switch the bonuses of two streets.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile on an empty block, a player can discard a Currency token and build over a block they have already developed.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most money wins, and earns a key to the city from the mayor!&#10;&#10;"

Most scenarios pit one player (or team of players) against another, with different win conditions depending on the scenario.&#10;&#10;Unlike many vehicle games that rely on arena combat, Road Wolf follows vehicles traveling down a long, dangerous road. Movement is relative to the other vehicles, as all vehicles are assumed to be hurtling forward down the road, represented by a &quot;road&quot; move at the end of each turn.  Hazards such as bridges or debris can move &quot;towards&quot; the vehicles during the road move, as can immobilized vehicles.&#10;&#10;Each turn, vehicles get two actions to spend moving, shooting, or other actions. Vehicles may Ram or Melee each other as part of a move action, encouraging close combat.  Degrees of success can damage or destroy vehicles or crew, or cause wipeout checks that can lead to lost ground or even chain reaction crashes.&#10;&#10;"

Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions.  Campaigns are a series of skirmishes. In campaigns, players begin with a squad of recruit characters.&#10;&#10;The game board for STA is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments.  The default game board is a destroyed urban setting.  Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid.  Characters use the grids for movement.&#10;&#10;STA is a scenario driven game.  Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually a secondary or tertiary objective.  Players win skirmishes in STA by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.&#10;&#10;Each character in STA is represented by a token and has a corresponding character card.  During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite status.&#10;&#10;Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six factions.  The Combine and Marauders are part of the core game; the other four factions can be integrated seamlessly.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Combine: The Combine is the military arm of the government that rules over much of what is left of the world. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Echo: Echo is a faction lead by a secretive cabal of humans with psychic powers. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Erthen: Erthen are a biologically developed race formed from a mixture of human, mineral, and organic matter. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Marauders: The Marauders are a loose-knit band of human rebels who specialize in guerrilla warfare. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Order of the New Dawn: The Order of the New Dawn are creatures from the strange subterranean realm known as the Basement. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Soldiers of Light: The Soldiers of Light are humans who believe the fall of mankind was brought about due to a dependance on technology.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"
