As the pitcher you decide your pitch with one of six pitch cards.  As the batter you pick your batting style card but hide it from the opponent.  You roll four colored dice to prepare for the pitch and then determine the amount of dice to adjust your swing and for power based on your batting style.  You can then roll dice to adjust the swing to match the pitch.  If you match you get a HIT and then determine how much power you put into the swing.  The power determines how far into the field the ball travels.  When there is a HIT, the opponent must place his player&rsquo;s &ldquo;up to 5 dice&rdquo; on the field in zones to see if they make the out. &#10;You can play a full game solo against an A.I. Bot or 2-player.  All the same rules apply to actual game of baseball with pitching, hitting and fielding but I removed balls and strikes to speed up play.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Whenever a unit tries to perform an action, its score is rolled against. Failure not only results in the attempted action failing but a fall in the &eacute;lan score, as the unit begins to succumb to the stresses of the battlefield. Under this system, even the most motivated troops will eventually be worn down and break.&#10;&#10;In the game, much of the minutiae of combat has been ignored. As Divisional or Brigade commanders, the players only see the results of actions, not the process on the ground by which those results are determined. A commander will know only that a unit has not advanced, not which one of the multitude of reasons why it hasn't. This absence of precise control at the company level, is mirrored further up the command structure by using a non-sequential turn sequence to simulate communications failures (and initiative) within the command system.&#10;&#10;&Eacute;lan contains army lists for 22 nations involved in the Great war and instructions on how to convert any MicroMark army list for play in the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Upon the result of the campaign hung the fate of Great Britain, and, by extension, the Allied cause in Europe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Atlantic Wolves&quot; is a solitaire wargame based on this important World  War II naval campaign. It covers the decisive part of the campaign,  August 1942 to May 1943. The player, assuming the role of Admiral Karl Doenitz, controls the German Kriegsmarine and tries to achieve success against the Allies, played by the game system. The game is a deluxe re-implementation of Gary Graber's classic wargame Battle of the Atlantic, now out of print.&#10;&#10;The map is a representation of the general locations where the Battle of the Atlantic was fought. There are seven named Areas on the board (e.g. Eastern Seaboard, Newfoundland, North Atlantic, Mid- Atlantic, Iceland, Bay of Biscay, and African Coast).&#10;&#10;Counters in the game represent German U-Boats, &ldquo;Milch Cow&rdquo; (Milk Cow) submarine tankers, ACE, Condor bombers, Surface Raiders, and Admirals Doenitz and Raeder. Also represented are Allied Escorts, Air Patrols, Convoys, and various markers. Each U-Boat counter (in the rules, simply termed &ldquo;U-Boat&rdquo;) represents 4&ndash;6 operational U-Boats.&#10;&#10;Victory is won by the German player sinking Allied ships and avoiding the establishment of a secure &ldquo;lifeline&rdquo; to Britain. The more tonnage sunk, the better for the Germans.&#10;&#10;The German wins the game by fulfilling three requirements:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Preserving the fleet. If, during any turn, one-half or more of the U-Boat counters that started the turn are sunk, Kriegsmarine morale is broken, the game ends, and the Allies win. Example: During the first turn, if three or more U-Boats are sunk the Allies win.&#10;    Preventing a &ldquo;lifeline&rdquo; to Britain from being established. If there are four Convoy markers on the board at the end of any turn, a permanent lifeline to Britain has been established, Kriegsmarine morale is broken, the game ends, and the Allies win.&#10;    Sinking Allied ships. The German must sink 600,000 tons for three consecutive turns AND average: 400,000+ tons for the entire game if there are no Convoy markers on the board at the end of the game; OR 450,000+ tons if there is one Convoy marker on the board at the end of the game; OR 500,000+ tons if there are two or more Convoy markers on the board at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;Description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

If necessary you could also use card counters.&#10;&#10;Minimal bookkeeping is required because Markers or Tokens are used to indicate the status of aircraft during the game. Furthermore you do not need to use a hex mat.&#10;&#10;The capabilities of aircraft within the game have been calculated, taking a common aircraft type of average performance as the base line, in this case the Albatros D.III. All other aircraft capabilities relate to how they compare with this aircraft. It is possible that the performance of this or that aircraft might not match your expectations based on anecdotal evidence. We make no apology for this as we are not trying to create a simulation. The resulting data has been kept to a simple format, which enables a Player to control several aircraft during a game, and the overall gaming experience will be improved if multiple Players attempt to &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; on each side.&#10;&#10;The abilities of pilots and crew are represented by having Skill Factors. These determine how well they fly their aircraft, their chances of hitting the target when shooting, and avoiding serious damage if their own aircraft is hit. Pilot skill is vitally important in air combat, and Players will need to learn where to position their best pilots, as well as to protect their novice aviators . In the case of aircraft with several crew members, Skill is determined for the crew as a whole. You do not need to keep track of individual crew.&#10;&#10;To carry out any action other than level flight requires the expenditure of one or more Orders, which may also require a successful Skill Test. Orders are generated each turn and better leaders generally mean more Orders. &#10;While air combat is probably what most players will want play, there are also rules for Ground Attack, Bombing, Photo Reconnaissance and Balloon Busting.&#10;&#10;Altitude represented during the game assumes that the main combat is taking place in roughly the same area of the sky, and it is possible to climb or dive to gain an advantage, or try to escape.&#10;&#10;Players alternate the activation of their aircraft. Optional Tactical Cards can be used during the game to provide additional detail.&#10;&#10;Data is provided for most aircraft that were in action during the First World War.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The ruins of an unknown civilization appeared but the earth's crust continued to tear apart, causing natural disasters all over the planet. Strange seismic impulses seemed to come from a temple within these unexplored ruins.&quot;&#10;&#10;Equipment&#10;Maztec comes with 28 &quot;game turn&quot; pieces, 38 &ldquo;gem&rdquo; pieces and 4 &quot;temple&quot; pieces: &#10;The four &quot;temple&rdquo; pieces represent 4 parts of the entrance to the temple. &#10;The &quot;gem&quot; pieces are of two different colors. The front shows a red or green gem with 3 or 4 symbols. The back shows a gray gem and two continuous pattern lines.  &#10;Each &quot;game turn&quot; piece is numbered from 1 to 28 on the back. The front reveals 1 symbol on the decor background of the temple.&#10;&#10;Overview and purpose of the game&#10;Welcome Adventurers! As an expert archaeologist of ancient civilizations, you have been commissioned by governments around the world to solve the temple enigma of this strange civilization.  &#10;After a trying journey, you approach these ruins. A camp has been set up. A strange temple with an entrance marked by two red crystals invites you to enter. Carefully, you enter this temple and feel terrible tremors around you. But you're brave and courageous, and you decide to continue as planned. &#10;As you explore the place, you discover new symbols. You also gather strange green and red gems surrounded by these symbols. These symbols appear to be clues that allow these stones to be placed in the right locations within this temple, by uniting them. After placing back a crystal, the tremors seem to be less important.  &#10;But the earth is shaking again. That&rsquo;s right. These crystals must be placed back as quickly as possible within the temple in order to permanently stop the seismic waves coming from this temple!&#10;You'll investigate why this is all happening once the challenge is faced, the problem solved.&#10;Only the  sharpest minds can solve the enigma behind these stones. It is now your turn... But time is running out... And if you can solve the enigma of thsi temple, you can finally declaim: MAZTEC!&#10;&#10;Elements of the game&#10;&ldquo;Game turn&rdquo; pieces: On the back, the number of the turn of play, and on the front, an element of the temple with a mysterious symbol. &#10;Temple:  the starting point for exploration. This temple is to be assembled at the beginning of the game, already shows you 2 symbols. It is made of 4 pieces.&#10;&ldquo;Gem&rdquo; pieces: On the back is a gray gem. Beneath this gem are drawn 2 lines of patterns. On the front is a red or green gem framed by 3 or 4 symbols on the front. These symbols allow you to form combinations by juxtaposing them. But the combination is only successful if confirmed by the perfect combination of patterns on the back of these pieces. The &quot;gem&quot; pieces also have a small &quot;spiral&quot; symbol (a sort of deception maker) located at the top left of each piece allowing you to always put them in the right way.&#10;&#10;Setting up&#10;It is necessary to assemble the entrance to the 4-room temple in the first place. You then have to form 3 stacks of parts: A stack of &quot;game turn&quot; parts, sorted from 1 to 28. Number 1 is visible at the top of the stack. And 2 stacks of &quot;gem&quot; pieces must be formed: a stack per gem color, gray gem on a visible blue background. At the beginning of the game, you have to reveal 2 gems below each &quot;gem&quot; stack.&#10;&#10;Each player also picks 2 &quot;gem&quot; pieces in the stacks: 1 red gem and 1 green gem per player that he places with the front visible before him. &#10;Solo mode: The one player 2 red gems and 2 green gems that he places in front of him.&#10;&#10;Course of the game&#10;The last player player to feel an earthquake begins.&#10;Game turn: &#10;The first player will pick a &quot;game turn&quot; piece and add it to the temple. It bears the number &quot;1&quot; on it. This begins the exploration and reveals a new symbol. At the beginning of each round, each player will pick a &quot;game turn&quot; piece. &#10;Possible moves during a player's turn:  &#10;- select 1 gem piece from the 4 visible ones and draw one of the same color to replace it. If there are no more gems to draw, replenish the pickaxes with discarded gems if there are any. &#10;- discard the 2 pieces of the pile of green or red gems and replace them with 2 others, then select 1 of the 2. &#10;    With the selected gem, you can:  &#10;    - place it on the temple by combining it, &#10;- add it to a gem or to a combination of gems from an opponent (except in a solo   game)&#10;    - add it to one of its gems to create a combination. &#10;If no placement is possible, the player places the piece in front of him. &#10;If a placement is successful, the player may try again to place or combine the pieces in his possession as long as his placement attempts succeed, at an opponent&rsquo;s (except in a solo game) or on his/her pieces. &#10;Last possible move: the player can try to place a combination of his/her gems on the temple. It is then the next player&rsquo;s turn (or the next turn in a solo game).&#10;&#10;Bonus move:&#10;At any time, the player can secretly (without revealing it to other players) return his/her gems to observe lines that can help him assemble the pieces.&#10;&#10;End of the game and goal&#10;&#10;&rdquo;If not all of the gems are placed in the temple before 28 turns... The end is near.&rdquo;&#10;Competitive mode: If all the gems have been placed, it is the first player who no longer has any gem to place who wins the game. &#10;Collaborative mode: If all the gems have been placed, your team wins the game.&#10;Solo mode: If all the gems have been placed before 28 turns, you win the game.&#10;&#10;If all the gems have not been placed, after 28 turns, the first player who no longer has any gems, or any more combination of gems in front of him, or who has the least, wins the game. &#10;Must-know: a combination of gem not assembled in the temple counts as a single gem. &#10;However, humanity will only be saved if all gems are correctly placed before the 28 turns.&#10;&#10;"
