Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.&#10;&#10;Each player has a &quot;family&quot; of misfits who are seeking to locate the legendary Necromonicon and bring it safely to &#10;their lair. Of course, to do this, they must do battle with the other families, attempting to slaughter them before they can find the treasured book. Yep ... it's mass carnage.&#10;&#10;Move, invoke special powers and battle. That's about it. Thankfully, the board is small, so you encounter your opponents by the second turn and from then on, it is a constant series of battles and deaths. That means dice rolling ... LOTS of it. Since each character has a special power, quite a bit of time is spent reading the player charts to discover what each character's powers are and how to use them.&#10;&#10;"

Ephraim Hertzano invented the tile game Rummikub in the 1940s when card-playing was outlawed under the Communist regime. After World War II, Hertzano immigrated to British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) and developed the first sets with his family. Over the years, the Hertzano family licensed it to other countries and Rummikub became Israel's best-selling export game.&#10;&#10;Hertzano's Official Rummikub Book, published in 1978, describes three different versions of the game: American, Sabra, and International. Modern Rummikub sets include only the Sabra version rules, with no mention of the others, and there are variations in the rules between publishers.&#10;&#10;In Turkey, the game is known as Okey and is widely played by families at gatherings or at local cafes.&#10;&#10;Like Rummy that you play with cards, you try to get rid of all your tiles by forming numbers into runs of 3 tiles or more, or 3 to 4 of a kind. The colors of the numbers on the tiles are like card suits. This game may start rather uneventfully, but when the players start putting more and more tiles in play, the options for your upcoming turns can become more complex, challenging, and exciting (from areyougame.com).&#10;&#10;"

The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both.&#10;&#10;When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew.

If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;"

Basically, you each have a base with 5 or 6 targets (some require multiple hits or hitting things in order).  You also have about 10 men.  You arrange a man on each target, and then place the rest on various grey dots on your base.&#10;&#10;You each have mechanisms to shoot little balls..catapults and crossbows and the like.  You take turns shooting 2-6 balls (depending on the die roll) at each other's targets.  You continue to take turns until you wipe out all of your enemy's targets.&#10; Connecting the two bases is a cardboard strip with trees and grey circles.  You can spend some of your shots to move a soldier towards your opponent on these circles.  You are allowed to place your shooting device closer to your opponent's base at this time...moving it up to be level with the advancing soldier.  However, advancing soldiers are quickly targeted.&#10;&#10;In play, the easy shots (soldiers and simple targets) get knocked out in the first few rounds.

With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a several small hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of 3 donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.&#10;&#10;Third edition (and later) player transporter tokens were upgraded to shaped wooden tokens.&#10;For its 20th Anniversary, Roads &amp; Boats has an edition that contains the &amp;cetera expansion: Roads & Boats: 20th Anniversary Edition&#10;&#10;"

Play is accomplished on a dual-action board game, with movement of Jetliners on the peripheral Treasure Runway, which dictate the movement of Treasure Seekers and Treasure Couriers along the Treasure Routes on the world map in the center of the board. When a Seeker reaches a Destination Foreign City (New York to Johannesburg for Diamonds), a suitcase which is color coded to the Treasure Route (Orange for Major Routes, Gold for Minor Routes, and Grape for Short Routes) is attached to the base of the Seeker, which becomes a Treasure Courier.  The Courier then returns the Treasure (in the suitcase!) to the U.S. City of Embarkation.  When the Courier reaches the Customs 12 Mile Limit it can't move without declaring the treasure or making a smuggle attempt.  SMUGGLE cards are collected to facilitate the smuggle attempts.

Players maneuver their way through the Abbey examining clues and questioning each other to find out who is the culprit.&#10;&#10;Monks are of three orders, three titles, fat/thin, bald/hooded, and bearded/clean shaven. One monk card is hidden, and the rest of the cards are distributed.  Turns consist of moving up to two spaces, and then asking a question of any other monks who are present there. (For instance, &quot;how many fat monks do you have in your hand of cards?&quot;.) Players may either take a &quot;vow of silence&quot; or answer truthfully; they then in turn get to ask the accuser a question if they answered the accuser's question.  &quot;Mass&quot; occurs every four turns: all players go back to the Sanctuary, an event card is read, and they then pass an ever growing number of cards to their left neighbor. Various rooms have special events or cards associated with them, e.g. in a Cell you get to pick a card from a neighbor, in the Cryptorum you get to pick up a card to take an extra turn later. Unlike Clue, you don't automatically win by making a correct Accusation: you get 4 points for getting it right, but you also get 2 points for each correct Declaration of a single trait, and lose points for incorrect declarations and accusations. So, e.g. a person could correctly Declare the culprit but lose the game.  Unique Events cards add randomness to each play, and the game begs for House rules to limit the questions.&#10;&#10;"

If a player starts his turn not in the Peleton, than he does not get the +2 slipstream bonus.&#10;&#10;If a player plays a card that is faster than the race leader, they either take the lead, or make up time until they catch the Peleton.  If they take the lead, they take the yellow token, and successive players must now match their tempo.&#10;&#10;You must play Headwinds when you draw them, and you can use Spurts as you like.  You play Mountain cards on yourself or the race leader, and they prevent anyone from passing the leader, and they also remove the 2 km slipstream bonus that other player otherwise enjoy.&#10;&#10;The race ends when the deck runs out.  The player holding the yellow token wins and scores a point, the other players lose points equal to the chips in front of them.&#10;&#10;Timing is everything if you plan to win.&#10;&#10;"
