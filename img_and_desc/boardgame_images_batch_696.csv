Players are immersed in a dark world full of destruction and suffering, a world where people are fighting to take back their place after a global nuclear war annihilated all achievements of the human race and all that was left was only a handful of usable resources. The remaining scattered groups of survivors are fighting amongst themselves for dominance over the remnants of the past. Now it is your turn to join the global war and recruit soldiers, battle machines, powerful hybrids, or tremendous mutants into your army. Equip your troops with the best available technologies and show all your enemies who is the ruler of the new order.&#10;&#10;Players are represented in the game by their hero and play units or one-time effects (tactics) in an attempt to destroy all cards from the opponent&rsquo;s deck. The number of cards in the deck and the player&rsquo;s hand is connected to the number of health points of the player's hero. For each point of damage that the hero receives, the player has to destroy one of their cards &ndash; from the top of their deck or from their hand. Once a player loses all cards from their deck and hand they lose the game. Because each card used by a player during the game costs them a life point, players are forced to play cards as efficiently as possible so that each played card does more damage to the enemy than to themselves.&#10;&#10;These combined mechanics create a well-balanced system where every erroneous move or unplanned action can lead to a player&rsquo;s defeat. Each and every decision is tightly coupled, and even a small decision can completely change the course of the game.&#10;&#10;Players have to find a balance between investing in game control, which allows them to play cards more effectively, or investing in killing the enemy hero, which is the primary goal. This means that players should control their damage output wisely. One can easily feed the enemy graveyard with destroyed cards, which may turn the game completely against them - because of the recycling system which allows players to put cards from the graveyard back on the battlefield. So, instead of dealing massive amounts of damage directly to the enemy hero, waiting sometimes has its benefits.&#10;&#10;Timing of attacks, card activation, graveyard management and tactical decisions are the real keys to victory.&#10;&#10;"

Includes Solo Campaigning (the Rise of Rome), Angevin Empire, Across the Steppes (Mongol Conquests), The Millennium Campaign (11th Century Europe), Crisis of Rome (3rd Century AD), The Wolf on the Fold (Assyrian Empire), The Calamitous Fourteenth Century (late Medieval Europe).&#10;&#10;Each of the seven Campaign wargames contains rules for re-creating the conflicts of a historical epoch and region, with counters on a map and using either a combat results table or miniatures.  They vary widely in complexity; some have minimal rules and can be played very quickly, while others have detailed political and/or economic rules.  The games are designed to entertain both historical boardgamers and miniatures buffs.  Several can easily be played solitaire.&#10;&#10;The point of each game is to determine by die rolls where conflicts arise, fight the battles and compare the outcome with history.  Several include victory point tables so that players can measure their success against each other or, if playing solitaire, against the historical outcome - for example, can the player outdo the Lionheart and King John in holding the Angevin Empire together?&#10;&#10;Some of the games can easily be completed in an hour, if using a combat results table; others take considerably longer, while all can last for many sessions if the battles are fought on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;"

The King has decreed a bizarre etiquette to be followed, in an attempt to discourage this behaviour. However, instead it has just turned the practice into an art and a sport, with each (surviving) noble having developed a particular expertise.&#10;&#10;In a round of play, goblets are arranged in a circle in the middle of the table, one in front of each player, such that players can&rsquo;t see their contents. Players take turns to secretly place wine, poison or antidote tokens into the goblets,  switching the goblets around, or using their characters special abilities. Each player has a target, and their aim is to ensure that, when the round is ended by someone calling for the Toast and the players all &lsquo;drink&rsquo;, their target&rsquo;s goblet is poisoned and theirs is safe!&#10;&#10;The game supports 2-12 players. The main rules are for 4-6 players, there are special rules to extend up to 12 players (where pairs of players play as a noble and their wine-taster), and there is a separate game mode for 2-3 players (a sort of Russian Roulette with goblets).&#10;&#10;"

The moles are well known for their blindness and, for this reason, you'll earn badges (points) if you can form uninterrupted lines of sight between your soldiers.&#10;&#10;Topoum features several different types of cards of four categories: combat, movement, expansion and special. Each game is different because you build the playing deck with seven types of cards (+110.000 combinations!).&#10;&#10;Each player has a private hand with two cards and there is a public row of five cards available for all the players on the board.

The deck consists of green cards numbered 1-40 and red cards numbered 10-30. Players start with ten cards in hand with 2-3 players and eight cards with 4-6 players. Set the deck nearby with the top card revealed.&#10;&#10;The start player plays any card to the center of the table. The next player must play a card at most ten lower or higher than this card, e.g., playing 14-34 if the 24 was lead. If the second-played card is lower (higher), then all subsequent cards must be lower (higher) &mdash; but also always within ten of the most recently played card. If a player cannot or doesn't want to play, they pass and draw the top card of the deck, then reveal the new top card. If all players pass in turn, then whoever played the most recent card clears the table and leads a new card.&#10;&#10;Two exceptions:&#10;&#10;1.

Each player with cards in hand scores -1 for each green card and -2 for each red card; the player who went out scores positive points equal to all the negative points scored that round.

It is a solitaire game challenging the player to conduct a successful mission where the criteria for success is not purely military. The player must organize, equip, and train a squadron of B-25 &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; medium bombers to attack a distant and rather dangerous target. The game not only covers the raid from launch to landing, it extends the story on both ends. Threatened from the air and from the sea, the player must do his utmost to strike the Japanese capital, avenging the attack on Pearl Harbor, and then land his aircraft safely. If the raid goes poorly it may boost Japanese morale and deflate the mood in the United States. Getting the B-25s close enough to launch is vital, as is the recovery of aircraft and crewmen, but above all, the player&rsquo;s main dilemma will be secrecy. The risk is great. Failure could mean the loss of an entire squadron, or worse, the sinking of a precious aircraft carrier. Will the Doolittle Raid add to the dismal news of Pearl Harbor, Guam, Wake Island, and Bataan, or will it signal the turning of the tide?&#10;&#10;The History&#10;Washington &ndash; April 21, 1942: After two days of rumor prompted by Japanese radio broadcasts, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt finally agrees to a press conference. Deftly avoiding difficult questions, he claims insufficient information to neither confirm nor deny the biggest news story of the four month old war. To placate tenacious journalists, however, he tells the press that the attack on Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo by United States aircraft, was launched from a mysterious base he would only call &ldquo;Shangri-La,&rdquo; an imaginary island from the recently published novel Lost Horizon. His impish grin, if not his words, tell the press that the top secret operation dubbed Special Aviation Project Number One has indeed been a success.&#10;&#10;That same day China&rsquo;s foreign minister hands a telegram to Army Air Corps Chief Hap Arnold. It has taken some time to arrive in Washington, an indication that all may not be well with the mission. Dictated two days ago by the commander of that top secret operation, a distraught Lt. Colonel James Doolittle, it reads:&#10;&#10;Mission to bomb Tokyo has been accomplished. On entering China we ran into bad weather and it is feared that all planes crashed.&#10;&#10;Telegram in hand, Arnold immediately admits to the commander of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the mission has failed. No bombers have been recovered. After sending that telegram, Doolittle himself expects a court martial, confiding to his engineer that they&rsquo;ll tie him to a desk for the rest of the war, if he&rsquo;s lucky. Days later he is astonished to learn of his promotion to Brigadier General, and even more so when he is notified that the president recommended the Congressional Medal of Honor.&#10;&#10;The Doolittle Raid remains an enigmatic and contradictory episode of World War Two, defying easy interpretation even to this day. Was it a victory or a debacle? Was it a minor footnote in the annals of that war or a significant military event? Was it a desperate bid to avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor, or, a harbinger signaling death and horror soon to visit Japanese cities from the sky?&#10;&#10;Narrative Sequence&#10;Much like chapters in a story, the game is organized in six narrative segments, chronologically arranged. Each poses its own set of challenges and prompts decisions that establish the environment and conditions of subsequent chapters.&#10;&#10;Planning&#10;Naval&#10;Flight&#10;Over Targets&#10;Recovery&#10;Debriefing&#10;&#10;Historical Scenarios&#10;Besides play of the full narrative, the game offers a number of historical dissections, each a scenario focusing on a fragment of the raid. They are also a handy way to learn the game, since each scenario uses only part of the rules. For example, Scenario One covers Doolittle&rsquo;s flight over Tokyo, using only the 8.5x11 Target Map and the Attack Segment. An alternative scenario looks at a night raid by that flight, as Doolittle originally planned it. After playing one or two small scenarios using only the Attack segment&rsquo;s rules, a larger scenario can be played adding the Flight segment. Graduate next to an even larger scenario that starts with the Naval segment. In this way a player can learn the game in program fashion, little by little, studying the history of the raid by playing it as he learns.&#10;&#10;Player Aid Folders: The game comes with several 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; bi-fold aids allowing the play of each game segment with minimal study of the rule book. The mapsheet is designed to interlock with other game components, including those play aids, in order to make the player&rsquo;s experience fluid.&#10;&#10;"

It combines trick-taking and area-majority.&#10;&#10;During the game, changes occur to both the trick-taking trump and the value of areas for area majority points.&#10;&#10;The game has Dice in the suit colours set up on a pentagram showing the value 2 at the start. The trick taking follows the normal pattern, with players following the suit lead if possible and the highest card winning. If there is a Trump suit, highest Trump card will win. But after each trick, the dice values change. The winning suit rises by 1 (or 2 if it was Trump). And one of the dice opposite that winning dice falls by 1. After this change, the lowest dice (if any) now becomes Trump.&#10;&#10;But this change in dice values also affects the players' scoring. Before the trick winner adjusts the dice values, the losers place one or two cubes against the dice of the suit they played (or its neighbour). NOTE, the winner of the trick does not get to place cubes, but does choose which dice will drop 1 point. At the end of the round, majority cubes score the face value of the dice (except the Trump die), second most gets half rounded down. Tricks won are also worth 2 points each.&#10;&#10;So the game becomes more than just winning tricks. Players want to lose tricks so they can place a cube (2 cubes if you lose on a Trump card) and gain majorities. But they also want to win tricks to control Trump or No Trump and lower the points on another dice.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#164;14&#228;&#184;&#150;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#178;&#180;&#230;&#151;&#143;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#168;&#169;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#233;&#151;&#152;&#228;&#186;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#136;&#135;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#148;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#190;&#161;&#229;&#128;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#128;&#148;&#228;&#184;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#164;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#143;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

Taking the role of aliens warning Earthlings of impending doom, players etch glyphs into crop fields with their spaceships, according to changing rules about adjacency between glyph shapes and glyph shading in order to score points for effectively following the rules set forth by the Intergalactic Communications Council.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player places any number of glyph tiles from behind their screen onto the board in an unbroken straight line, connected to glyph tiles that are already on the board. That player scores points for the sum of the values of only the glyphs played (affected by on-board multiplier squares) multiplied by the number of glyph tiles already on the board that were adjacent to their play. Thus, a long string of glyph tiles played parallel to a previous play can net massive points, so players must balance taking advantage of opportunities for huge points with preventing such opportunities for other players. Finally, that player then draws exactly three new glyph tiles either among five face-up glyph tiles next to the play area or from the bag of remaining glyph tiles, regardless of how many they played on their turn, as long as they played at least one glyph.&#10;&#10;Glyphs come in four shapes (circles, squares, triangles, and stars) and four shadings (empty, solid, striped, and crossed). Each shading is permitted only to certain shapes, and when a player places glyph tiles on the board, they must satisfy the requirements of both the glyphs being places and the glyphs they are playing adjacent to. The more complex a shading, the more difficult it is to place on the board and the more points it is worth: empty glyphs have no restrictions about what shapes they may be placed adjacent to and are worth only one point; solid glyphs may be adjacent to only three of the four shapes and are worth two points; striped glyphs may be adjacent to only two of four shapes and are worth three points; and crossed glyphs may be adjacent only to a single shape and is worth four points! However, the four active rule cards that determine these permitted adjacencies will get replaced throughout a game, providing new opportunities to play glyphs. Players must plan ahead, acquire useful glyphs, and play them on the most opportune turns.&#10;&#10;"

188502,,"Form on Admiral's Wake is a quick-playing miniatures game of fleet naval battle during the age of sailing warships.  It allows for the play of larger naval battles with a small number of players who will each control one or more squadrons of ships.  The game is typically played with miniatures on a hex grid.&#10;&#10;The game system uses an action deck to determine which ships can activate and what actions they can perform.  The action cards have limitations based on a ship's fleet, sail state, wind orientation, crew quality, and damage level.  The more favorable the condition and status of a ship, the more cards it will activate on.&#10;&#10;One card is flipped each turn and ships that meet the requirements of the card may perform actions as indicated in the instructions.  The actions allowed vary by card, but include moving one hex, sideslipping one hex, turning in a hex, and reloading cannons.  Once fired, cannons require two actions to reload.&#10;&#10;After all actions from the flip of a card are completed, all ships with loaded cannons may fire simultaneously.  As a ship takes damage, its status reduces from undamaged to disabled to crippled.  As the status changes, the ship will have less chances to activate.&#10;&#10;Additional rules cover critical hits, grappling, fires, forts, anchoring, and fire ships.&#10;&#10;"

When was the last time you told a group of people about a past accomplishment that you're proud of, or had a game challenge you to write a thank you letter to a loved one?&#10;&#10;Better Me also harnesses the power of accountability. Any player committing to an action must find an accountability partner to help make sure they follow they follow through on their commitment. Both players write down the action to be taken, and the target completion date on their game sheet. This accountability strategy is key to insuring that players take action and grow.&#10;&#10;Players move around the game board and draw cards which prompt all sorts of positive action and discussion. Players race to fulfill each of their five life areas, heart, mind, body, people and tangibles.  The game is won by the first player to &quot;fulfill&quot; (3 points) each of the five categories; heart, mind, body, people, and tangibles.  Alternatively, the game may be played to a time limit, and if no player has fulfilled all categories by the end of the time limit, the player with the most total points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In addition to being played by groups of friends and family, Better Me is also popular with counselors, schools/universities, youth mentoring programs, recovery programs, hospitals, etc.&#10;&#10;It's a new and engaging way to improve yourself and your relationships with friends, family, and coworkers, all while having fun!&#10;&#10;"

Somewhere amongst the pictures showing is the item matching this description but finding the match may not be as easy as it seems as the pictures have been chosen so as to appear to be something else and a little imagination may be needed to make the match. Whoever makes the match first takes both cards and then the next stack card is turned over and a new match has to be found. When all cards in the stack have been used, whoever has the most cards in the winner. The game rules state that it is for two players or teams but clearly any number can play.&#10;&#10;"

In the LCD tradition, they are perfect for those wanting a game that is fast to learn and quick to play. These games will include all new graphics, corrected errata, and consolidated rules.&#10;&#10;Volume I features four of the most famous and significant battles from the First English Civil War (1642-1646) which saw  Royalist ('Cavalier') supporters of King Charles I against the Parliamentarian ('Roundhead') supporters of the Long Parliament.&#10;&#10;Edgehill (1642): Charles marched on London intending to force a decisive battle with the main Parliamentarian army under the Earl of Essex.. They met  at Edgehill in the  first pitched battle of the war. Both armies were inexperienced and ill  disciplined, and many fled or simply set about looting the enemy baggage train. As a result the battle was inconclusive and the war would continue for another four years.&#10;&#10;First Newbury (1643): Almost exactly a year later and we see Charles again facing the Earl of Essex. The Royalists had enjoyed a series of successes which had left the Parliamentarians in disarray. As Charles besieged the town of Gloucester, the Parliamentarians mustered a force under Essex and through surprise succeeded in breaking the siege. They then fell back towards London. The Royalist rallied and, overtaking the Parliamentarians, blocked the path to London at Newbury. A surprise dawn attack saw the battle initially going in Essex's favour. Royalist counter-attacks were bloody and Essex was at risk of being encircled but fought back and pushed forward again - only to be slowed by Royalist cavalry. The Parliamentarian force was split in two but the Royalists attempt to drive through and encircle the wings was unsuccessful. With night falling and both sides exhausted the battle drew to a close. Next day, short of ammunition, the Royalists were obliged to allow Essex to continue his march to London.&#10;&#10;Marston Moor (1644): This was to be the largest battle of the Civil Wars and saw the Royalists under Prince Rupert and the Marquis of Newcastle facing a combined English Parliamentarian /Scottish Covenantor force under the Lord Fairfax,  the Earl of Manchester and the Earl of Leven. Rupert marched to break the siege of the Earl of Newcaste at York. The armies met outside York on Marston Moor but Rupert, who had sought battle, hesitated from attacking due to being outnumbered. Towards evening the Parliamentarian and and Covenantors took the initiative and launched a surprise attack. After two hours of fighting Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry following which the Royalist infantry were annihilated.&#10;&#10;Naseby (1645): Though the war would continue for another 18 months, Naseby was the decisive battle of the First English Civil War, seeing Charles' main army, led by the King and Prince Rupert, destroyed by the Parliamentarian New Model Army under Fairfax and Cromwell. The Royalists held a strong position on a ridge between two villages but left it when they saw Parliamentarian cavalry withdrawing. Having redeployed the Royalists attacked and the two centres were soon locked in melee. On the Parliamentarian left the two cavalry wings engaged. The Parliamentarian cavalry broke and the Royalists pursued. After an initial face off on the Parliamenraian right, the cavalry wings engaged and the Royalists were routed by Cromwell. Unlike the Royalists on the other wing, only part of Cromwell's horse went in pursuit, with the rest attacking the Royalist centre - at the same time as a smaller attack on the other flank. The King sought to assist his beleaguered centre by personally leading his lifeguard to the rescue but was restrained . Rupert eventually rallied the horse  attacking the Parliamentarian baggage and returned to the field - but too late.&#10;&#10;"
