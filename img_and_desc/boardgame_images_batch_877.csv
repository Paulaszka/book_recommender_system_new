It has just come to an end and you are a ghost, floating in the air! Terrified, you look at your own body. A group of strange individuals have gathered around your mortal remains, watching it closely with sparks of fascination in their eyes. They want to communicate with you to discover how your life ended. You need to talk to them and reveal the truth so the culprit can be judged!&#10;&#10;Paranormal Detectives  is a deduction party game. One player takes the role of a Ghost. All other players work as Paranormal Detectives and need to discover how the victim died. Using paranormal abilities they will communicate with the Ghost, asking open questions about the details of the crime. The Ghost answers in a variety of ghostly ways - by arranging a hangman&rsquo;s knot, playing chosen tarot cards, creating a word puzzle on a talking board, drawing by holding the hand of a detective and many more!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the Ghost player receives a story card with a full description of the murder. Each card depicts all the details of the case. Each Detective receives asymmetrical, pre-constructed set of interaction cards, player investigation sheet, and a player screen.&#10;&#10;On their turn, each Detective asks the Ghost any open question they want and plays a single interaction card. The card implies the way the Ghost may answer the question. There are 9 different interactions total, most of them giving information to all Detectives. Since Detectives may ask any open questions and interaction cards vary, the game allows for lots of creativity for both the Ghost and Paranormal Detectives.&#10;&#10;Detectives may try, twice during the game, to guess what has actually happened to the victim stating who was the killer, where did it happen, what was the motive, how was it done and what was the murder weapon. Then the Ghost writes down secretly on this Detective&rsquo;s investigation sheet how many of their answers are correct.&#10;&#10;The game can end in two ways: &#10;&#10;     If a Detective gives all correct answers. In this case, they win, together with the Ghost player.&#10;     If all Detectives run out of interaction cards. In this case, if no one has guessed everything correctly then, whoever guessed correctly the most information is the sole winner of the game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Note: The rulebook includes a fully cooperate variant.&#10;&#10;"

Over time we experimented with, and discarded, a number of different ideas - streamlining game play to keep the games as simple yet challenging as possible.  With game times lasting 5-10 minutes each we feel that the 3 games presented in this set enable strategy players to always have access to a quick, tight, and challenging game wherever they are thanks to the compact and light design.&#10;&#10;The three games are:&#10;&#10;Vancanna&#10;&#10;With only 12 pieces on the board the simplicity of its looks belies the strategy involved in winning.  Players are attempting to move 3 of their coloured pieces off the opposite side of the board, the catch being that if they can jump their opponent's piece then they must make that move - and doing so will cause the piece jumped to be flipped to their colour.  It may sound counter-intuitive, but the strategic use of forcing your opponent to jump your piece, and thereby losing it, can actually be advantageous as it could trigger a series of moves that see your pieces advancing across the board.&#10;&#10;Talluka&#10;&#10;This game is deceptively simple yet players can quickly find themselves with a limited number of optimal moves.  Pieces are slid across the board one space per turn, the catch being that they can only move if they are on the outside of a line and are adjacent to another piece in the direction they are moving so that they can push that piece as well.  Align 4 of your pieces adjacent to each other and in a vertical or horizontal line and you win.&#10;&#10;Gopurrum&#10;&#10;Gopurrum involves moving and jumping your pieces around the board as you attempt to make a stack of pieces 4-high.  Each time you jump a piece, or a stack of pieces, the top piece on that stack is flipped so that it changes sides.  Only your pieces, or stacks where your colour is showing on top, can be moved on your turn - and no move can end with more than 4 pieces being on a stack.  Players can shed the top piece of a stack to an adjacent empty space if the top piece is theirs, but be careful as you may also be helping your opponent.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

In 1687, Louis XIV wanted to transform the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent accord and send an ultimatum to the emperor who refused. The German princes and the great European powers form an alliance to counter France&rsquo;s politics of expansionism and religious persecution. France finds itself diplomatically isolated.&#10;&#10;The War of Spanish Succession (1701-1713) - King Charles II of Spain dies with no descendants. The two principal reigning families of Europe, the Bourbons (France) and the Habsburgs (Austria), are both related to Charles II and claim the throne. The principal stake is the domination of Europe by seizing the enormous heritage of the Spanish Habsburgs. France is confronted with its fiercest military enemies: Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy.&#10;&#10;Maximise your resource points to recruit armies, build strongholds, lead sieges and battles and win glory points.&#10;&#10;Will you be able to vanquish Montecuccoli, Eugene of Savoy or Marlborough with Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Villars and impose the Sun King&rsquo;s will?&#10;&#10;The game includes :&#10;&bull; One 59 x 41 cm map&#10;&bull; 270 double-sided, pre-cut counters and markers&#10;&bull; A book of rules and scenarios&#10;&bull; Two colour player aids&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

The conflict is better known as the Winter War as it happened during an extraordinarily cold winter.&#10;&#10;The game emphasizes military operations on a strategic level using block game pieces to obscure the information on the block labels to simulate the fog of war.&#10;&#10;The game also has a political layer to reproduce the international atmosphere as the eyes of the world were fixed on the war. Both nations must keep an eye on their Morale status as if it falters, it may hinder their number of actions per turn.&#10;&#10;In addition, Finland has to manage its dwindling resources as it was not prepared for a full scale Soviet offensive after just a few decades after the nation gained its independence and fought a civil war. The Soviet military on the other hand was not prepared to encounter such fierce resistance and to fight in such harsh weather and terrain. The Soviet Union has to reform its military to readjust to these matters.&#10;&#10;The game revolves around two unique 45 card command decks, one for each player. Each command card has an event and command point value to activate units and perform strategic actions. Both players also have two special unique decks of 5 cards to represent the international support for Finland and the reformed military approach for the Soviet Union. Both special decks contain what-if scenarios in addition to historical course of events.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

However, the mass of ice is melting and everything will sink into the sea if everyone gets on the same ice.&#10;&#10;The game consists of 3 rounds, and the players go hunting 4 times on each round.&#10;&#10;On each round, 5 prey (ice) cards are placed in a row. Each player places a polar bear token on their lock-on card behind their screen to secretly indicate which preys they are aiming at. When everyone is ready, they remove the screens and reveal where they are going to place their tokens with the shout &ldquo;Three, two, one, Zappaaaan!!&rdquo; and move the tokens onto the prey cards.&#10;&#10;Except for the 1st hunting, the prey (ice) card with the most tokens on it melts and sinks after hunting. The players can also use penguin (hindrance) tokens to make other prey cards sink more easily so that the one they want does not sink.&#10;&#10;After the 4th hunting is over, each player gets VPs equal to the value on the remaining two prey cards multiplied by the number of their polar bear tokens on them. At the end of the 3rd round, the player with the highest VPs (polar bears that ate a lot of preys) wins.&#10;&#10;After the 4th hunting is over, each player gets VPs equal to the number written on the remaining two prey cards multiplied by the number of polar bear tokens.&#10;&#10;At the end of the 3rd round, the player with the highest VPs (the polar bear that has eaten the most preys)
