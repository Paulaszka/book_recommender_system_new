Everybody who was anybody had come to Manhattan to celebrate the opening of the magnificent Grand Hotel &ndash; aspiring politicians, powerful industrialists and beautiful actresses. The largest luxury hotel in the United States was set on redefining the term &ldquo;five-star&rdquo;, and was also to be the crown jewel in the empire of Frederic Price. The hotel tycoon was one of the richest men in the country. Since his marriage to the actress D&oacute;ra Galor, he was now even better known than before.&#10;&#10;The opening speeches were full of praise, and the guests ate and drank copious amounts from the five-course menu. The evening had all the hallmarks of an incredible coming-together of American high society. Once the official part of the event was over, the guests gathered for an exuberant cocktail party at the longest hotel bar in the entire city. But the evening took a tragic turn when the young actress Monique Moreau was found dead in the bathtub of her hotel suite late in the evening. The idea that the young woman, described by the media as the next D&oacute;ra Galor, would take her own life is rejected by everyone as incredible.&#10;&#10;The police were informed immediately. But it will take the authorities hours to search the entire hotel and secure all the relevant evidence. You have all been requested to stay here in the lobby.

If any cards remain undistributed, you need to put them in a separate stack on the table.&#10;     Cards with vignette will be stacked on the table.&#10;     Cards with sabotage actions will be shuffled and given 10 to every player (if there are 6 players, any of them will be given 8 cards). The rest are placed on the table.&#10;&#10;&#10;All players start from Bucharest and roll the dice. They need to move their pawn an equal number of points as corresponding on the dice (but he can't step twice on the same point in a turn). If the pawn is placed on a highway point, the player can ask for the related card, by initiating an act of sabotage against the player who owns that card.&#10;&#10;What is sabotage:&#10;Sabotage cards have a number of points (e.g.: 1 / 2 / 8 / 0.1 or -3 / -5 etc). A player who wants a card for a highway, needs to put down a sabotage card of negative value (e.g.: -3). The opponent must repel the attack with 1 or more cards with positive value until their sum is greater than the opponent's card (-1 equals +1 or overcome with +2). In case of equality, challenged player can keep his card. Otherwise, if the challenged player overcomes the attack, he can choose a card with cities from the player who initiated the attack. If the challenged player is defeated, the player who initiated the attack receives his requested card.&#10;&#10;Vignette cards: &#10;Can be used only at border crossing points in order to obtain 3 sabotage cards OR to ask for any of highway city cards.&#10;Every route has a specific number of points.

Reach into your bag to select wooden flowers, then place them on your secret board in the order of the paths you want most. But when players reveal their choices, things get delightfully tricky. Experience the magic of Umbra Via and find out why this award-winning design belongs on any table.&#10;&#10;In more detail, at the start of each round four tiles are revealed from the deck, with each tile showing part of a path, e.g., a straight line, a curve, or a T. Players secretly draw three cubes from their bag and place them on spaces on their personal board corresponding to these tiles. They all reveal their choices, move their cubes to the chosen tiles, then secretly place three more cubes, then move those cubes to the tiles. Whichever tile ends up with the fewest cubes on it is placed in the 4x4 grid first, maintaining the same orientation, by the player who bid the most cubes on that tile. (Some cubes in your bag are worth two cubes during the bidding phase, but are then removed from the tile and returned to your bag prior to placement.) Then the next tile is placed on the grid, and so on.&#10;&#10;When you place a tile, if all the &quot;open&quot; ends of that path are cut off &mdash; whether by the edge of the board or other tiles &mdash; you count how many cubes each player has on the path. The player with the most placed cubes retrieves &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes from the reserve equal to the number of tiles in the path, adding these cubes and all other cubes to their bag. The player with the secondmost cubes on the path retrieves half this many &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes, and so on. After removing and returning all the cubes on this path, remove the tiles from the grid, placing them in a discard pile.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has retrieved all of their &quot;double-bidding&quot; cubes from the reserve, they win!&#10;&#10;"

The rules cover the period roughly 1740-1790 in Europe.&#10;&#10;In these rules, battles are won with lines of well-drilled, bayonet-armed infantry delivering coordinated volleys of musket fire. Cavalry in general cannot take on steady infantry frontally and artillery is not yet powerful enough to be a battle-winning arm.&#10;&#10;A typical game has about a dozen units per side. A game like this should take under four hours for a pair of opponents familiar with the rules to complete.&#10;&#10;The rules work best with units of 24 infantry models, 12 cavalry models and batteries of 2-4 gun models but this is not a strict requirement.&#10;&#10;Game setup usually involves two opposing forces facing one another across a table laid out with terrain models representing hills, woods, streams, etc.&#10;&#10;The usual table size is 4-6 feet deep by 6-8 feet across.&#10;&#10;Figure and Ground Scales:&#10;&bull; One infantry model = 20 actual men.&#10;&bull; One cavalry model = 20 actual men.&#10;&bull; One cannon model = two actual guns.&#10;&bull; One gunner model = 5 actual crewmen.&#10;&bull; One inch = 20 actual paces (50 feet).&#10;&#10;Turn Sequence&#10;&#10;     Rally &amp; Command&#10;     Move&#10;     Shoot&#10;     Close combat &amp; Recovery&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

This landmass, called Pangaea is where our story begins.&#10;&#10;At the same time, in the far far distance of our Galaxy an earth disaster is heading our way. The famous asteroid that hit the earth over 65 million years ago. When this asteroid hits the earth, the game will end and we will see if the ancestors to mankind where able to survive allowing us humans to rule the planet as we do today.&#10;&#10;During the game play, Pangaea will change, continents will rise and fall, opportunities to survive will come and go, are you lucky enough? Are you strategic enough?&#10;&#10;Dinosaurs will make your changes to survive more difficult and volcano eruptions can happen any time, covering everything in lava.&#10;&#10;Earthquakes and Tsunamis are mother nature&rsquo;s forces that will challenge you. Are you able to outsmart your fellow players? It&acute;s survival of mankind but it better be your offspring to rule the world, or perhaps nobody shall survive!?&#10;&#10;This game is a typical hex-tile and worker placement. Tiles will also be stacked/unstacked on the board during the game.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with 4 cards at hand, visible to all. &#10;From the 4 cards you select 2 (or 3 for experience gamers) to represent in order: &#10;&#10;     a number of tiles displacement of the event-locator, &#10;     an action that will take place at that new location and &#10;     (optional, based on chosen game play) the range, i.e. number of tiles, that is affected by that action. &#10;&#10;&#10;Played cards are discarded and new cards are added to the players hand for a next round.&#10;&#10;The event-locator, positioned on the board, points out where the action as given by the card will take place. Possible actions are land-rise, land-fall, climate change, earthquake/tsunami or dinosaur placement. Depending on the game-type, more than 1 tile can be affected.&#10;&#10;Each players meeple walks around the continents to harvest points or to place shelters (up to 3) but they are continuously in danger due to the effects of the actions that can happen to the continent (or tile) the players meeple and shelters are on. As player, you can chose to work with your fellow players or work against them, finding an alliance or break it again.&#10;&#10;Not all land-types can support players meeples or dinosaurs, but you can buy evolution cards that can give you a bit of help, but it will cost you points.&#10;&#10;Not all land-types are suitable for shelter building either or you shall choose between scoring points and harvest or not to harvest and move to a better spot to be able, in your next turn, to finally build your shelter. Can you build and keep your shelters on the board and earn the most points along the way? Shelters that you can keep on the board start earning points for you as well.&#10;&#10;Only if at least 1 of your shelters survives the end game when the famous asteroid impacts the earth, then and only then will you have a change to win the game. During the game-play the asteroid is triggered and will move closer to earth from the starting place you have chosen. This determines (more or less) the game length. The speed in which it approaches is different each game, making it hard to predict how much time or turns is still left in the game. But when the asteroid reaches the earth, the end game begins.&#10;&#10;Simply stated, ensure your ancestors survive the impact and earn the most points during the game, that will make you the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

326659,,"Top Tale: Tall Tale is a spin off of Top Tale: The Original Game (O.G.), where the twist is that for each topic a fantastical element must be added into the players' responses. Similar to The O.G. series, the game can be played with 2-10 players, ages 10+, and a typical game lasts 30+ minutes, taking less than two minutes to learn.&#10;&#10;In Top Tale: Tall Tale, players will still get to know each other, however the stories aren't expected to be based solely on the truth. The stories are expected to be exaggerated and unbelievable, which makes the best story often times the most entertaining story.&#10;&#10;Top Tale: Tall Tale can be integrated with other Top Tale volumes during gameplay, where the Tall Tale cards are clearly marked to cue players to stretch the truth. The other game play mechanics are all the same as the rest of the Top Tale series.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"
