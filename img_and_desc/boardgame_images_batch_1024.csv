However, there was also a third peninsular power, autochthonous Hispanic Islam, heir to the cultural splendor of the extinct Umayyad Caliphate of C&oacute;rdoba and now, doubly threatened by the Christian crusade and the Almohad jihad, desperately trying to fight for its own independence (the Sharq Al-Andalus, represented by the Levantine emirate of Murcia-Valencia, under the Banu Mard&aacute;nish dynasty, and by the Pirate emirate of Mallorca, under the Banu Ganiyya dynasty).&#10;&#10;In the game, each player will take the role of one of the three main powers (Christian Kingdoms, Sharq Al-Andalus and Almohad Caliphate) that vied for power, hegemony and survival in the Iberian Peninsula during those troubled years. Whether through military force, political cunning, seductive diplomacy, commercial wealth or cultural splendor, the player's objective will be to accumulate the greatest number of victory points to become the peninsular power with more fame and glory.&#10;&#10;Mechanically, the game uses a card-driven system, consists of 7 turns and each of them represents a period of 9 years, beginning in the year 1150 and ending in the year 1213. At the same time, each turn is divided into 5 different phases. The game is completely asymmetrical, as each power has its own geographic position, resources, rulers, courtiers, military leaders, allied factions, and totally unique and specific thematic minigames. The game ends if one of the following conditions is met: that a player reaches 50 victory points, that the end of turn 7 is reached (the player with the most victory points wins) or that the Sharq Al-Andalus is annexed (in which case the Christian player or the Almohad player will win, depending on their victory points).&#10;&#10;The conquests of Alfonso VII of Leon &quot;The Emperor&quot;, the Almohad invasion, the Mediterranean takeoff of Catalonia, the resurgence of an independent Al-Andalus in the peculiar figure of the libertine emir &quot;The Wolf&quot;, the Castilian civil war between the feuding families Lara and Castro, the appearance in Navarre of Richard &quot;The Lionheart&quot;, the French influence in Occitania-Provence, the commercial relations with the maritime republics of Genoa and Pisa, the last blows of the Byzantine Empire, the offensives in the Maghreb of the ancient Vikings from the Kingdom of Sicily and the Ayyubid Egyptians of Sultan Saladin, Majorcan piracy led by his corsair emir &ldquo;The Serpent&rdquo;, the Arab and Berber revolts in Ifriquiyya, the construction of the Seville mosque, the recovery of Aristotelian philosophy by Ibn Rush, the political intrigues of Queen Eleanor Plantagenet, the II, III and IV Crusades in the Holy Land, Simon de Montfort's crusade against the Cathars, the consolidation of the Camino de Santiago, the publication of the Song of the Cid or the epic battles of Alarcos and Navas de Tolosa, are just some of the many national and international historical events that the player will be able to relive in first person throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Welcome to a world of swords and shields, castles and sieges, knights and pirates, kings and courtiers, emirs and caliphs, bishops and imams, ambassadors and pilgrims, merchants and philosophers, cathedrals and mosques, holy wars, palace conspiracies, and even, maritime expeditions to the exotic Orient.

And will Poland survive the Swedish deluge?&#10;&#10;Raison d&rsquo;Etat is a board game for 1-7 players. It is a standalone expansion for Coalitions, with its own distinct game board and seven playable nations (Poland, Sweden, Britain, France, Spain, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire) included in the box. Unlike other expansions for Coalitions, you do not need the base game of Coalitions to play Raison d&rsquo;Etat. It comes with all the components, rules and scenarios necessary to play.&#10;&#10;Players engage in an exciting area control game of shifting alliances and coalitions, of intense back-stabbing, diplomacy and bold military actions set in an era defined by the upheaval of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War and the Polish-Swedish Wars. As in the Coalitions&rsquo; core game, Raison d'Etat&rsquo;s uses the Wheel of War mechanic to virtually eliminate downtime, while the innovative Activator system introduces a new level of dynamic interactions between the players.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

As a builder, face your opponent in a duel and achieve the greatest influence within its sacred construction.

On a turn, you take one of two actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take stones of one color from the quarry into your workshop, with each workshop holding at most three stones. You can take up to three stones of your color (black/white), up to two neutral stones (gray), or one stone of your opponent (white/black).&#10;    Play any stone from your workshop onto the game board. The board has seven locations, each with a unique power, and each location can have a column of at most five stones. If you place a stone of your color in a location, then you take the special action associated with that location, e.g., moving the top stone of a column to another location, moving a stone from the opponent's workshop to your workshop, placing a second stone from your workshop, or returning a played stone to the quarry.&#10;&#10;&#10;When all seven columns have five stones on them, the game ends and players receive points for each column where they have more stones than the opponent &mdash; but this isn't necessarily a good thing. When you score a column, you receive 1 point for each stone of your color, 3 points for each stone of the opposing color, and -2 points for each neutral stone. each column awards points to the player who has the most stones of their color in that column.&#10;&#10;In the advanced mode of Tholos, you place one or more ornament tiles on the game board, each in a different location. Each ornament tile has a power that changes the rules of the game, such as activating the power of a location with gray stones, awarding a column to the player with fewer stones than the opponent, or raising the maximum number of stones in the location's column to seven.&#10;&#10;"
