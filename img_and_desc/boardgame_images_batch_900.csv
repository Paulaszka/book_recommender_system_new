The FTCN (Federation of Time-Traveling Capable Nations) has voted that all nations must give up their time travel capabilities. A single task force of &ldquo;time editors&rdquo; (agents that specialize in changing the timeline) will be kept on standby in the event that they are needed to save humanity from any possible future disasters. Only the nation with the most skilled time editors will retain their use of time travel. The task force of time editors will be chosen through a &ldquo;time editing&rdquo; trial. The first nation to prevent four disastrous past events will retain the use of time travel and will have command of the official global task force of time editors.&#226;&#128;&#139;&#10;&#10;PLAY:&#10;The game is a blend of:&#10;&bull; resource and economy management&#10;&bull; a worker placement system in the present and past&#10;&bull; storytelling&#10;&#10;To win the game you must prevent 4 disastrous events in the past from happening.&#10; Player mats have two halves - past and present. People and resources you take to the past can only be used in the past. People and resources you keep in the present can only be used in the present. Each player has 4 types of time editing specialists: Science, Technology, Military, and Politics. Specialists have unique abilities when they are in the present, but when they travel back in time to change the past you lose their abilities in the present.&#10;&#10;You can send 1 to 4 specialists back in time if you have the necessary resources. Sending multiple, or all, at once will reduce the wormhole resources needed by reducing the number of time jumps (1 per turn). But keeping some specialists in the present will allow you to use their abilities to strengthen your economy, intelligence, and undermine other nations. Who and when you send where is your choice!&#10;&#10;Each player is given unique disasters in the past that they will need to prevent. (There are 16 time lines with 80 unique events). In order to change the time line and prevent a disaster, you must change the events leading up to the disaster. Certain specialists are needed to change specific events but you can decide which event you travel to. Attempts at changing the time line involve storytelling (a game tester favorite!) and pulling tiles to create ripples through time.&#10;&#10;In order to time travel and pay specialists to change the past, you will need an economy. There are over 130 possible economic setups with variable risk/reward factors. Players explore planets, build mining colonies, mine resources and transport them to Earth. Planets further from Earth have richer mining deposits but will take longer to reach (unless you can afford to create wormholes or pay to use other players&rsquo; wormholes).&#10;&#10;Resources can only be used once they are returned to Earth, so you will need to plan ahead multiple turns for where/when your time ship will be and which specialists are where/when. Resources can be used to buy items for your economy, buy action cards (draw 3 &amp; choose 1), open wormholes in space (for faster travel to planets), open wormholes in time (to change the past), pay time editing specialists to change the past, or hire A. I. to give you the probability of causing a time ripple.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Give each player three coins, with the start player taking an additional coin.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you can either move the token on the market board to a different color and take the silk piece and any coins from this space, or pay 2 coins to choose any silk piece from the main four colors, whether from the market board or in the reserves. (The start player can place the token on any of the four colors on the first turn.) You then place the silk on your board. Your first piece must cover at least one square in the center of your game board; each subsequent piece must lie orthogonally adjacent to a piece already on your board, and pieces of the same color cannot be adjacent to one another!&#10;&#10;If you cover an ornament space on your board, you can pay a coin to take a high-quality silk piece and place it on your board. If you cover another ornament space, you can do this again. To end your turn, (if needed) choose a silk piece from the reserve of the same color that you took and place it on the market board, then place a coin from the bank on any market space that doesn't have the token in it.&#10;&#10;Whenever you achieve a secondary order during play, such as covering a hole with high-quality silk or placing a second piece of the same shape, you receive a bonus immediately.&#10;&#10;After eight rounds, the game ends. You receive a bonus based on how well you completed the main orders, such as creating a silk-filled square or filling the diagonals of your board. Additionally, each filled vertical or horizontal line is worth 3 points, each uncovered ornament 1 point, each hole -1 point, and each coin 1 point as long as you have at least three coins. Whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;"

You operate a series of Coast Guard Rescue Stations located just outside the area.&#10;&#10;YOUR MISSION: pilot rescue choppers into the dangerous Triangle in search of human survivors.  But don't let the UFOs zap you out of the Solar System.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY (solo version):  You have enough choppers for six rescue flights.  Start each mission by scratching the triangle in front of any rescue station, indicated by a black dot along the sides of the large triangle.  From there, fly in any direction by scratching any triangle that is next to the space you currently occupy.&#10;  &#10;Continue flying through the triangles in search of human ships.

A UFO abducts you and all your passengers back to Andromeda to work as slaves in a pyramid factory.  This ends that mission and you score no points.

It's the top of the ninth,  Neither team has scored.  Who will win this critical game?&#10;&#10;PREPARATION:  Choose your team.  The teams bat with a lineup of four batters picked at random from their full team of nine.  A batter's lifetime &quot;stats&quot; are shown below his name.  The batting order starts at the top (near the pitch indicators) and is repeated if necessary by returning to #1 as the fifth batter.  Keep track of all base runner with pennies placed on the baseball diamond.  The &quot;Muggers&quot; bat first.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:  The pitcher throws each ball by placing his finger tip on the pitch of his choice and announcing either &quot;fast ball&quot;, &quot;curve ball&quot;, or &quot;slider&quot;.  The other player then scratches any one of his four &quot;swing&quot; boxes&quot; under the pitch for the player he has at bat (if all a batter's swing boxes are scratched for one type of pitch, the pitcher must throw something else). It will reveal one of the following results:&#10;&#10;HR (Home Run)  - It's a hit out of the park.  The batter and all runners score.&#10;&#10;X (Strike) - Get 3 strikes and the batter is out.&#10;&#10;W (Walk) - The batter advances to first base.&#10;&#10;G (Grounder) - It's a hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one of his ten &quot;Infield&quot; squares to see the results of the play.&#10;&#10;FB (Fly Ball) - It's a  hit.  The pitching team must play the ball.  The pitcher scratches any one his ten &quot;Outfield&quot; squares to see the results of the play.&#10;&#10;When and Grounder or Fly Ball is played by the pitcher the following things can result:&#10;S (Single) - The batter and all runners advance one base.&#10;D (Double) - The batter and all runners advance two bases.&#10;T (Triple) - The batter and all runners advance three bases.&#10;HR (Home Run) - The batter and all runners score.&#10;O (Out) - The batter is out.&#10;DP (Double Play) - The batter and the furthest advanced runner (if there is one) are out.  Scratch two out squares on the scoreboard.&#10;&#10;Keep track of &quot;Runs&quot; and &quot;Outs&quot; by scratching the squares left to right on the score board.  After the &quot;Muggers&quot; have made three outs, the roles reverse and the &quot;Bats&quot; come up to the plate.  After the &quot;Bats&quot; have three outs, the game is over.  The team with the highest score wins.  In the event of a tie, play another card for &quot;extra innings&quot;.&#10;&#10;SPECIAL HINT:  You will notice, after playing a few games, that each of the nine batters on each team always bats exactly the same way every time.  For example, Homer Bundy, the slugger Right Fielder for the &quot;Muggers&quot;, always hits a home run if you pitch him a fast ball.  The more you know about each batter, the better you can pick the right pitch or choose the right swing.  Fast ball pitches tent to either be hit hard or get a strike.  Sliders tend to produce grounders, and curve balls tend to produce a lot of fly balls and walks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"
