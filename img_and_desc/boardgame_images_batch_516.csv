Devised at a &quot;Famous London Literary Club&quot;, it was probably a new idea over 100 years ago.&#10;&#10;52 cards all feature letters, each with a value that relates to the rarity of the letter in the English language (For example, an E would be 4, a Q would be 1, and so on). This value is important because if a player goes out whilst you still hold cards, then you give him the score of your unused cards - i.e. you are not penalised much for holding 'difficult' letters but you are if you hold common letters.&#10;&#10;The game mechanic is simple. In a turn a player may lay as many cards as he wants but he must always have in mind a genuine word that could be spelt out eventually. For example, you might lay an L. The next player lays a T after the L (he is thinking of SALT). The next player might lay an I and an M after the T (he is thinking of ULTIMATE) and so on, until a player is challenged that there can be no such word with that array of letters (By the way, the letters must stay in the order they are laid, there is no rearranging letters). If challenged, a player must prove that he was thinking of a word, and if proven true, he receives payment (counters) from the others. If he was bluffing, he pays out counters to the persoin who challenged him.&#10;&#10;When the game time is finished, the one with the most counters, wins.&#10;&#10;By the way, in 1900 or so, they must have been aware of Analysis Paralysis because there is a fixed rule 'If you take longer than 30 seconds to play or pass, you forfeit your turn and must draw an extra card into your hand'.&#10;And another oddity, how often are you told to enjoy your game - in Latin?

(Soldiers of Chaos, Anarchy &amp; Rebellion).&#10;&#10;Six of the world's top ten elite fighting forces are represented among the members of the Team: the Russian Spetsnaz, the French Naval Commandos, Israel's Shayetet 13, the U.S. Army Airborne Rangers, U.S. Marine Special Operations Command and the U.S. Navy SEALs.&#10;&#10;Choose your side: one player controls Zulu 6 while the other controls S.C.A.R. The objects of the game: During each mission, Zulu 6 must use their elite combat skills to complete 2 mission objectives. S.C.A.R. must stop them with the use of overwhelming forces.&#10;&#10;The game begins with the Zulu player choosing 3 of the 6 team members as his/her first assault team while S.C.A.R. player builds the game board by laying out 4 inch map tiles printed with a dirt path cutting through a jungle, placing each tile so that the path is continuous until the line of sight ends in a curve or a 3-way &quot;T&quot;. As the Zulu 6 team moves along the path, the S.C.A.R. player continues to build it. Some of the map tiles contain hazards designed to slow the Zulu 6 team members while others contain mission objectives such as a prison camp, a weapons facility and a downed spy plane. There are also map tiles that contain symbols that allows the S.C.A.R. player to place a number of his troops in that tile to keep Zulu 6 from completing its mission. The S.C.A.R. player also has the ability to spawn more troops to keep the danger moving.&#10;&#10;Combat between the 2 armies is resolved using 6-sided dice (D6). Each Zulu 6 team member has a stat card that explains his special skill and lists how many attack dice he gets during combat as well as areas to keep track of ammunition spent during combat (10 slots) and wounds taken (3 slots). Each time a Zulu 6 team member attacks, a marker is moved 1 space along his ammo track. The same happens when a team member takes a hit. Every roll of 5 or 6 on a Zulu 6 die roll is a kill. Each S.C.A.R. trooper only gets 1D6 and a roll of 6 on the die is a wound on the target Zulu 6 team member.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, Zulu 6 races to achieve mission objectives as S.C.A.R. sends wave after wave of troops at them. All the while, Zulu 6 receives 5 mission points for each objective achieved and for each S.C.A.R. troop killed and may use these points in trade for special actions such as healing a wound, an extra attack die, an ammo drop to reload weapons or even to call in reinforcements if a Zulu team member is lost in combat.&#10;&#10;There are 3 missions to complete that make up the core game, each with 2 objectives.&#10;&#10;With expansions coming soon featuring different mapped environments, daring missions, and new team members, you can take Zulu 6 around the world battling the evil forces of S.C.A.R.&#10;&#10;"

The first to either control the five middle spaces or push the other player's king off the board wins.

The game is designed in recent times but with the ambition of resembling a game that could potentially have been found in a Viking grave.&#10;&#10;In the game, the players start on each short end of the board and take turns. Each turn they can make five moves. For a move, a player either moves one piece (Hird or King) one step, moves a Hird into or off a Karve (boat), or moves a Karve and all Hirds on it one step. A Karve may have at most four Hirds on it. Pieces entering empty spaces have to stop. Pieces entering enemy-controlled spaces stop on the line between the spaces. After a player's five moves, any conflicts (pieces on lines) are resolved. All pieces except empty Karve are worth 1. The King is tiebreaker. In case of a loss, solitary Hirds are removed from the game, Karves and Hirds in Karves are removed from play, and Kings have to retreat to an adjacent empty or friendly space. If there are no possible squares for the King to move to, the player loses. If after their turn a player controls all five middle spaces, that player wins.&#10;&#10;There is also a doubling coin in the game affecting points received if several games are played.

It's your job to make a path from START to the treasure and collect the three keys that will open the treasure's locks before the Ogre gets there. Strategize, cooperate, and build the path together.&#10;&#10;Children as young as two can play this co-operative tile laying game.  On their turn, the player draws one tile from the bag, and it will either show a piece of path or picture of the Ogre.&#10;&#10;Working together the players need to first make a path to the three keys that open the treasure and then lay a path to the treasure itself.  All the while, each Ogre tile gets him closer to the treasure, and the players losing.&#10;&#10;Everyone works together on the tile placement and either they win together or lose together.&#10;&#10;The game has simple rules and does not require reading, meaning that even kids as young as 2 can be involved.&#10;&#10;"

But your race is not alone in its aspirations for dominance of the cosmos, or in having the power to realize that goal. Races hailing from various star systems venture out in all directions. Many paths are dead ends, but some sectors have sizable deposits of rare minerals that can be refined into the precious fuel crystals that drive your space fleets onward. Soon, a trail of colonies leads out from your homeworld, and soon the races venture into the same cosmic regions. Don&rsquo;t get too attached to your fleets or interstellar empire, because tides can and will turn quickly. Only you can determine the fate of your people: interstellar conquest or infinite servitude.&#10;&#10;StelCon: Infinity is a light strategy war game on a galactic scale. 2-6 players can expect around 30-45 minutes per player, so 2 players can often power through a game in about an hour. The 6 player game is kept short by combining into 3 teams of 2 where the teammates execute their turns simultaneously.&#10;&#10;Variable game board. There are 6 races to choose from, each with its own strengths. Although the jump lanes that connect the sectors forming the galactic map are printed on the game boards, each sector location is covered by a different card from the sector deck each game.&#10;&#10;Sectors are drawn from the deck and placed as the players explore the galaxy, so you never know what you're going to get...unless you do some scouting with your fighter squads or happen to have some telepaths on board your ship (telepaths are handy that way). Some of the sector cards are identical and therefore also create a &quot;bridge&quot; which is a unique adjacency in addition to the normal jump lanes. All this makes for a very different board every time.&#10;&#10;Moving your space fleet around is straight forward. Each ship can move 1 sector per turn, plus 1 extra sector per turn per engine MOD. Your space ships are modular in design, both from a gameplay and a literal perspective. You physically insert engines, extra guns, and fighter squads into holes in the space ships. We call these MODs.&#10;&#10;Combat is simple but tense. Add up your firepower present at the battle site and then toss in a d6 roll. The opponent does the same. Compare the two totals, and the winner keeps the sector in question while the loser retreats and loses a ship from his fleet.&#10;&#10;While the game is a conquest type game, it ends immediately when one player conquers any homeworld, so there's no eliminated player stuck waiting around for the game to finish.&#10;&#10;Conquest cards are the soul of the game. The deck of 120 cards gives tons of gotcha moments, and serious replay value. They allow you to do all sorts of fun things:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Modify the firepower of your sector or your ship&#10;     Boost fuel crystal production (the economy of the game)&#10;     Steal or stop opponent's cards&#10;     Cheat the dice&#10;     Wipe out a whole sector&#10;     Even influence battles your forces are not involved in, adding an element of table-talking diplomacy to the game&#10;&#10;&#10;"
