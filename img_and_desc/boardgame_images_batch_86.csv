Taking turns, each player rolls the special die and draws a deck from the indicated deck to start testing his or her knowledge (and to move his or her token).&#10;&#10;The four different categories have different styles of tests and rewards.  The Big Picture provides a snippet of a plot and asks for the movie title and two of its major stars; a correct answer allows the player to move their token ahead a space.  Fast Forward/Rewind provides three clues on an actor or film, advancing the player's token two spaces for a correct answer but backwards two spaces for an incorrect one.  Correctly answering Outtakes' questions about trivia allows a player to move an opponent's token back three spaces.  Action's task is basically a scramble against time for everyone to write down 6 films related to a category, advancing those who answered correctly.&#10;&#10;The first player to move his or her token to the last space on the board wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
