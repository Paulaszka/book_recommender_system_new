The faster you are, the more points you score &ndash; assuming you're correct, of course.&#10;&#10;In the basic game, each player holds a wool card and the two halves of the box are laid face-up on the table, one showing a sheep in the bottom and the other a wolf. Players roll five or seven animal dice, depending on the number of players, then they try to scan the dice quickly to see which animal group &ndash; the sheep or wolves &ndash; are in the majority so that they can through their wool card in that box. Players who do so score 0-3 chips, depending on the number of players and how quickly they threw in their card; anyone tossing in the wrong box loses one chip. The first player to collect ten chips wins.&#10;&#10;In the advanced game, a spice/wool die is rolled with the animal dice, and players need to throw the appropriate card &ndash; spice or wool &ndash; into the appropriate box. In the elite game, a blue animal die comes into play. If the blue animal die is part of the sheep/wolf majority, then game play is identical to the advanced game for that round; if not, then players must throw the symbol not showing on the spice/wool die into the right box.&#10;&#10;One final variant can be used with all three levels of play: When the sheep are in the majority, those who score in the round receive a sheep chip; when the wolves are ascendant, they receive a wolf chip. The winner is the first player to collect both five sheep chips and five wolf chips.&#10;&#10;"

The board is rotated 45 degrees to have clearly seven columns with varying number of balls (1-3-5-7-5-3-1 on the surface of the Shibumi pyramid).&#10;&#10;Rules: the board starts with two red balls placed in the left and right corner holes. Two players, White and Black, take turns placing one ball of each color adjacent to each other. The balls can be placed on board holes or on top of 2x2 platforms of existing balls. You can place a ball on a hole and the other on a platform, as long as they touch each other.&#10;&#10;Aim: without the left and right corner holes there are five columns with an odd number of balls on the pyramid surface (3-5-7-5-3).

The winner is the player who has won at least 3 columns.&#10;&#10;Variant for expert players: players score one point when they have conquered a column composed by three balls, two points for a five balls column and three points for the seven balls column.

The game board displays the six districts of Venice, and players earn VPs for placing council members into these, for building bridges and placing gondolas to connect the districts with one another, and for building advantageous buildings.&#10;&#10;The game is played over six rounds, with each round consisting of three phases:&#10;&#10;1. Acquire cards: Each player takes a set of cards.&#10;2. Play cards: Players use cards to perform certain actions.&#10;3. Activate buildings: Players may take advantage of their buildings and use their powers.&#10;&#10;In phase 1, sets of eight cards are displayed (with six cards face-up and two face-down). Each player takes one set, then reduces his hand to seven cards. A card shows one of six specific characters (Architect, Merchant, etc.) or is a wild card.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 consists of six sub-phases in a fixed order, one for each character. In each sub-phase, players choose whether or not to play one or more cards of that specific character. Each card allows them to perfom that character's action, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take one piece of gold for each Merchant card you play.&#10;     Place one council member into the current district for each Council card you play.&#10;     Take a building with a value equal to or lower than the number of Architect cards played. The higher its value, the better its function.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever plays the most cards in each such sub-phase receives a bonus of one free action of that type. In case of a tie, whoever is farthest along the &quot;Doge&quot; bar gets the bonus &ndash; and of course to advance on the Doge bar, players need to play Doge cards.&#10;&#10;Finally, in phase 3, players may take advantage of their buildings. For each piece of gold paid, a player may use one of his building's ability.&#10;&#10;Players collect VPs both during the game &ndash; from special buildings and by building bridges between districts &ndash; and at the end of it &ndash; for majorities of council members in each district. The value of each district evolves during the game: Each district is adjacent to four other ones, and at the end of the game, they will be connected either via bridges or gondolas. A bridge increases the value of the adjacent districts by 3-6 victory points, whereas a gondola increases this value by 1 point. The player with the most council members in a district earns VPs equal to the district's total value, the player with the secondmost council members earns half this value, and so on. While it's important to establish majorities in the districts, it's also crucial to control their values by cleverly placing those bridges and gondolas.&#10;&#10;"

Each army plays differently-- the French have a more traditional sequence of play, their allies the British are activated by chit pull, and the outnumbered Russians must contend with morale checks while dealing with phases that are scattered throughout allied phases.  The Russians have a terrain advantage which they historically squandered; the allies possessed a technological advantage in the Minie Rifle, but due to poor communication, it was not used by the British until late in the battle, when it turned the tide decisively.  Combat is resolved by comparing modifiers to defense rolls, and the type of attacking unit determines the available outcomes.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&#10;&#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&#10;&#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!&#10;&#10;Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&#10;&#10;The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.&#10;&#10;"
