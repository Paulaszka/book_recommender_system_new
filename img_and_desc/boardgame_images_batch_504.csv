Tangram Fury can be played individually, or in teams, with as few as two players.&#10;&#10;Players compete against each other to be the first to build tangram puzzles shown on cards. The first player done, wins the card. The first player to earn five cards, wins the game.&#10;&#10;Tangram Fury has two levels of play: &ldquo;Fan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Expert&rdquo;. The Fan level is easier, because the shapes on the cards have borders that show how each of the seven tangram pieces fit together to form the shape. The Expert level only shows a silhouette of the shape and players must figure out which pieces go where.&#10;&#10;The game includes four categories of tangram images: people, animals, fish &amp; birds, and objects &amp; shapes. Each category is represented by colored cards. Rolling a multi-colored die determines the categories.&#10;&#10;"

After you've played all three cards, you then check to see if you match any of the pattern cards set by the side of the board, ranging from 2 to 5 points. If you can claim a pattern, you keep that card and get the points. Once all 8 pattern cards are claimed, the game is over. It's all explained on one small two-sided rules sheet.&#10;&#10;"

The sheep player must save as many sheep as possible, while the wolf must feast on those sheep. Chomp!&#10;&#10;Sheep, Dogs and Wolves has two types of game play:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Duel: The players play two complete games, switching roles after the first game. Whoever saves more sheep wins.&#10;    Bid: Before the game starts, players take turns make increasing bids as to how many sheep they think they can save. The player who passes first plays the wolf; the other player must save at least as many sheep as he bid to win.&#10;&#10;&#10;To start play, place one tile on the table. Players, starting with the sheep, alternate placing tiles on the table, with each tile needing to fit in an imaginary square grid and being adjacent to at least one already-placed tile. Once all tiles have been placed, the game ends.&#10;&#10;To score, first place a counter on each wolf that has at least two dogs orthogonally adjacent to it; these wolves are &quot;scared&quot; of the dogs and won't eat sheep. Next, place a counter on each sheep adjacent at least to one uncovered wolf; these sheep have been eaten by the wolves. Count each uncovered sheep; these sheep are safe, and the total number of safe sheep is the sheep player's score.&#10;&#10;"

However, if the player over-estimated the actual item value they take a profit loss and log the item as trash on their score sheet. If the player winning the item that round under-estimated the item they make a profit and the item is scored as a treasure on the score sheet.  At the end of the day, profits and losses are totaled up and the player with the largest profit is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
