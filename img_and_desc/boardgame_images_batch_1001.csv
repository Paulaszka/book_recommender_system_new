Next, each player chooses one card from their hand, then reveal them simultaneously; if an odd number of revealed cards have a time symbol, flip over the time card. Then repeat this process, with each player choosing, then revealing another card from their hand, flipping over the time card again if an odd number of revealed cards have the time symbol.&#10;&#10;Now determine who won the round: If the time card shows the sun, the color with the highest visible sum among visible cards (which includes the first card revealed) is the winning color; if the time card shows the moon, then the color with the lowest sum wins. All players who have played at least one card in the winning color now collect any visible card and place it in front of them. Remove all the remaining cards from play, deal two cards to each player, then start the next round.&#10;&#10;When the deck has no cards in it, the game ends, and players tally their score based on the number of stars on cards in front of them.

One player is in charge of the PRC army and the other player is in charge of the Republic of China (Taiwan) army.&#10;&#10;In historical fact, although the PRC army, which had gained momentum in the previous victories, landed, the lack of preparation and training for the landing operation was remarkable, and only about 9,000 people were able to actually land on Kinmen Island. On the other hand, the Taiwanese army expected the PRC army to land on Kinmen Island, and was waiting for the PRC army with 40,000 troops, including reinforcements from the 18th Army (however, most of the 18th Army arrived after the battle was over). Also, for the PRC army, which had no anti-tank equipment, the M5A1 light tanks of the Taiwanese army were a threat.&#10;&#10;In this way, looking back on history, it was an inevitable landing operation, but it is not without the element of &quot;what-if&quot;. If the PRC army had more boats ready for landing, if command and control were good, if they chose a different coast for the second landing... In this game, by introducing such &quot;what-if&quot; into the game, the PRC army is also given the possibility of winning.&#10;&#10;First published with &quot;Banzai Magazine EX&quot; #3.&#10;&#10;"

However, Pi&#197;&#130;sudski, the commander of the Polish army, ordered a desperate counterattack against the southern flank of the Western Front, which was created by the delay in the advance of the Southwestern Front.

In addition, the virus is spreading in the city, so you have to hurry or you will get infected too.&#10;Even if you don't have strong weapons, work with your friends and you'll get everyone out!&#10;&#10;Basic how to play :&#10;Each player chooses a character.&#10;Set all the cards face down in the middle of the table.&#10;On each round :&#10;- every player reveals a card from the center : take the items and leave the zombies in the middle of the table.&#10;- each player may then exchange items, use their character's special skill or use items to defeat the zombies.&#10;- when players are done with their actions, if there is one or more zombie remaining face up on the table, one of the players become a zombie (he now counts as a zombie and will attack other players on future turns)&#10;If the players manage to get four special items (the map, radio, car and fuel) before the end of the 5th round, they escape the city and win the game. Their score then depends on the number of characters (NPC included) they could save.&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#187;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#173;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#233;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#154;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#231;&#165;&#158;&#231;&#181;&#140;&#232;&#161;&#176;&#229;&#188;&#177;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#232;&#166;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#232;&#187;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#167;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#229;&#143;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#140;Kishii&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#153;&#144;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#141;&#177;&#233;&#153;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#231;&#180;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#191;&#133;&#232;&#166;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#142;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#149;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#232;&#161;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#151;&#133;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#228;&#189;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#186;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#128;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#230;&#159;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#191;&#131;&#233;&#133;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#140;Kishii&#227;&#128;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#233;&#129;&#148;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#230;&#132;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#131;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#232;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#190;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#188;&#183;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#230;&#173;&#166;&#229;&#153;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#178;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#231;&#154;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#232;&#132;&#177;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&
