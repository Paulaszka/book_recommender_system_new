They draw assignment cards from a deck, take money (the amount depends on which city zone they are in and where they are going) and drive to the address on the card using movement points rolled with a six-sided die. Players decide beforehand whether the game ends for example when someone has completed five assignments or when the last card in the deck has been drawn and the action completed.&#10;&#10;During the game, the players are free to choose their routes in the streets, but movement has some restrictions: right-hand side traffic, stop signs, one-way streets etc. Violating the no-stopping sign or speed limits results in a ticket and the player loses money (for example rolling a 5 on a street with a speed limit of 3 means that the player pays 2). There are also tunnels and a ferry which give additional choices. If cars of two players collide, both go to the repair shop and the player who was moving at the time must pay a sum equivalent to the remainder of movement points on the die. Among the assignment cards there are a few cards on car maintenance, vehicle inspection and insurance which require payments and movements to appropriate locations. When the end conditions agreed upon are met, the player with the most money wins.&#10;&#10;The rules were written in May 1968. The original game board is a paper sheet glued on a thick two-fold cardboard. The city zone payment chart is thin cardboard as are the 70 cards and the small square ferry.

Players select their club and, using a standard deck of cards, draw one and consult a result chart.  Using the result and a special ruler, players move their ball markers along the hole, including possibly slicing or hooking the ball (approach shots do not conform to the slice and hook requirements though).&#10;&#10;Each hole has standard features of a regulation golf hole, including out-of-bounds, water, and sand traps.  Hitting from the rough or from other course features may require the pull of an additional card to incur a &quot;penalty hazard&quot; (a modifier to your shot).&#10;&#10;All in all, the game simulates a real game of golf with simple gameplay but decisions you would be face with in a regular game as well.&#10;&#10;"

Each deck contains 10 sets of 4 matching colored cards, one wild card, and one black card.&#10;&#10;The center of the table contains one less peg than the number of players. Once anyone in the circle has a set they can grab a peg &ndash; after that it&rsquo;s a free-for-all to get one of the colored pegs before they&rsquo;re gone whether you have a set or not. Each peg is worth a different point value and one player will be left empty-handed each round, so you&rsquo;ve gotta be fast to get one! Each player earns points depending on the color of the peg they grabbed. The player without a peg earns no points. Players who have unused wild cards or black cards in their hand at the end of the round lose points.

It has a diameter of approximately 38 cm. The game is played in the box using 3 regular D6 dice. You also need a piece of chalk for scoring.&#10;&#10;There are different playing versions of this game. Special houserules/pubrules are common.&#10;&#10;The most common rules:&#10;Each player gets 15 points to start with (or 9 for a short game), marked with chalk on their side of the Pietjesbak.  The purpose is to get the highest score within 3 rolls and with that lose all his points.  The starting player can roll any/all three dice up to 3 times. Each other player gets as many rolls as the first player, and tries to get a higher score.&#10;&#10;One counts as 100, 6 counts as 60,  the other numbers count as their face value. Special combinations have a higher score. The highest score wins the round and the player can reduce their score by 1, 2 or 3.&#10;&#10;The different scores (from lowest to highest):&#10;&#10;     3 numbers that are not one of the special combinations below. The dice are added together. Example: 1,2,6 = 100+2+60 = 162. The winner reduces their score by 1.&#10;     Zand/Sand, 3 identical numbers. Example: 3,3,3. The higher the better (except: 1,1,1 aka Drie Apen). The winner reduces their score by 2.&#10;     Soixante-Neuf/Sixty-Nine (4,5,6 = 4+5+60 = 69). The winner reduces their score by 3.&#10;     Drie Apen/Three Apes (1,1,1 = 100+100+100 = 300, which is unbeatable).
