The first to 100 points wins!&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a simple draw/play cards that challenge card management skills with a focus on nature and the beautiful diversity of species that we currently have on our own planet.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Choose between a Nord, Dunmer, Imperial, Altmer, Khajiit or Orsimer. Equip your character with a wide range of weapons, spells and armour. Travel across the Holds of Skyrim to places like Riften, Solitude, Falkreath and Whiterun. Attempt a huge range of evolving quests that change the game with each decision, Explore the wilderness. Gain side quests from mysterious characters. Delve into ancient ruins and tombs. Battle Draugr, Frostbite Spiders, Dragons, Dwemer Constructs and Daedra. The deeper you delve, the deadlier your foes will become. Gain experience and amazing treasures. Upgrade and enchant your gear. Level up your character with a wide range of unique skills and abilities. Play through six chapters of two huge campaigns spanning 25 years in the history of Skyrim in this endlessly replayable boardgame.&#10;&#10;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim &ndash;  The Adventure Game is a 1-4 player co-operative game of adventure and exploration across Skyrim. Players take the roles of heroes involved in epic quests, working together to defeat their enemies and exploring the vast expanse of Skyrim. You will be able to choose character miniatures like the Khajiit, Nord, or High Elf; plan your strategy with weapons or spells; and fight your way through forgotten mines, Draugr-infested tombs, or ancient Dwemer cities to find ancient treasures and increase your power.&#10;&#10;The players must keep an eye out as the threat increases across Skyrim as Dragons, Daedra, Trolls, and more roam the lands and wreak havoc across the holds. Players need to work together to keep the lands free, whilst balancing the demands of their most important quests.&#10;&#10;The base game is divided into two campaigns of three chapters each. The decisions the players make from their first turn have a distinct effect on the unfolding story and encounters, making the whole campaign experience different every time you play. You can even save your progress after each game and start the next chapter with the same character, equipment, and skills.&#10;&#10;With the numerous choices of characters, gear, magic, and skills matched with the many decisions each player makes through their quests, there are literally hundreds of hours of gameplay, with some stories not even seen based on your early decisions. The face of Skyrim can change during the game, impacting the course of the players' experience in subsequent chapters. At any time, the players can simply reset, choose another character and play style, make different choices, and experience things differently. Alternatively, pick a chapter that sounds fun and drop in to just play that adventure as a one-off.&#10;&#10;Key mechanics:&#10;&#10;A Living Board&#10;The game board represents the province of Skyrim. Players move their characters &mdash; represented by 32mm scale plastic miniatures &mdash; across the region, visiting Strongholds, exploring dungeons and meeting interesting characters as the story unfolds. But they are not the only ones there; roaming monsters appear, blocking roads and threatening the peace in Skyrim. Several game effects could lead to the fall of a Stronghold so players need to keep an eye on the state of unrest and the active dangers across the board.&#10;&#10;Customizable Characters&#10;There are no classes in Skyrim. Each character has a different starting innate ability and additional abilities that are unlocked as they learn specific skills, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they are tied to a gameplay style. For example, even though Nords shine when they are developed with a focus on warrior skills and equipment, a player could decide to make their Nord a spellcaster, or a summoner, and still retrain midway through the game after finding an amazing sword they really want to use. Players can change their progression path mid-game, and enjoy many different play styles.&#10;&#10;Upgradeable Equipment&#10;There are plenty of equippable items: weapons, pieces of armor, trinkets, etc. Most of these items can be customized; by either Enchanting or Upgrading them in a Stronghold. When Upgrading or Enchanting an item, the player draws an Enchantment/Upgrade card, and slots it underneath the item, altering its properties. A piece of armor can be Upgraded so it becomes better against Heavy Attacks, for example, and it can also be Enchanted so it helps the character regenerate Stamina faster. When learning the Smithing and the Enchanting skills, the players get to draw more cards and choose between them, making the experience of customizing equipment richer and letting them focus on the playstyle they prefer. Furthermore, when playing in a group, one player can specialize their character in Enchanting or Smithing and upgrade all their allies' items by meeting in a Stronghold, adding another layer of cooperative gameplay.&#10;&#10;Quests in Cards&#10;The story in the game is told using Quest cards. Players draw Main Quests &mdash; those that push the narrative forward &mdash; and Personal Quests &mdash; side stories gained by exploring the vastness of the province of Skyrim. By completing or failing them, the story progresses. Many of these Quests give the players a choice at the end. This choice chains the Quest with a new one, creating a branching story that changes every time the game is played. Failing a quest doesn&rsquo;t mean losing the game; instead, failure often becomes another way of choosing. The cards are organized in a way in which, if a card is removed as a result of Quest being failed or a game effect is triggered, the next card will take its place, dramatically changing the story.&#10;&#10;Combat System&#10;With an assortment of weapons, ranging from daggers to bows, players will be able to engage in combat with dangerous enemies, whether they be in a dungeon or part of a questline. Each weapon and spell will inform the player what attacks it can perform and how much Stamina or Magicka they&rsquo;ll have to spend to use them. The player will roll the custom dice and attempt to overcome each weapon&rsquo;s specific Skill Tests; hitting with heavier weapons is bound to be harder than hitting with lighter weapons. Combat is fast, exciting, and deadly, although strategy is a key factor to success. Some enemies, in fact, will employ unorthodox tactics, including the ability to heal themselves or wear nearly impenetrable armors.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Crawling&#10;Players can visit increasingly dangerous caves, mines, tombs, ruins, and Dwemer cities across Skyrim. Dungeons are built with cards each representing a major threat in that area of the dungeon. It might be a terrifying Draugr or a surprise trap that, if you&rsquo;re lucky, one of the characters may be capable of disabling. As the characters level up, the lower-level adversaries are discarded, scaling the difficulty of the dungeons along with the player&rsquo;s level. The more you visit a certain type of dungeon, the more likely you will see its more fearsome denizens, albeit with better rewards!&#10;&#10;Cooperative&#10;The whole game is fully cooperative. Players are encouraged to discuss their strategies and to collaborate to advance in their own storylines. Each player will be following their own storyline, joining together at the end of each chapter, when their plots are woven together into an epic finale for the whole party. &#10;There are some situations where characters, even if they have the same overall goal, find themselves on opposite sides of a struggle, and may interfere with each other as they progress. This gives an interesting layer of light competitive gameplay, whilst still keeping the cooperative nature of the game in the forefront.&#10; Expansions&#10;The Dawnguard expansion will add a third campaign with three additional chapters to play through, new characters, dungeon adversaries, treasures, events, and more. One of our expansions will make the Ghosts of the Blades haunt you throughout Skyrim during the first Campaign of the game and another threatens devastation to Skyrim in the form of a great dragon! There is much more to be revealed through the Gamefound campaign. The team has planned for a massive upgrade kit converting all the wandering monsters over to 32mm scale plastic miniatures which are all compatible in scale with the miniatures game The Elder Scrolls Call to Arms. More information will be revealed in the run-up to the launch of the board game&#10; &#10;All in all, the Elder Scrolls Skyrim Adventure Game will offer players dozens and dozens of hours of adventure exploring the game world. Expansions will ensure there&rsquo;s even more Skyrim to be had.&#10;&#10;"

In the 1 player game you can take command of either one or two ships (depending on difficulty) and follow some of the most dangerous sea journeys of the time.  Enemies such as Dutch, French and Spanish ships will stand in your way, alongside the most famous pirates ever to sail the seas.&#10;&#10;The aim is simple! Destroy all of those in the way and make it back still afloat.  Management of HP and ammunition will be key towards the decisions needed to be made on the way.&#10;&#10;There are 5 journeys in total in the single player (3 in the two player), and your level of success will depend on the amount of foes you defeat whilst completing those journeys.  On each journey there are 7 positions, at each position you draw a card.  This card is most likely to be one of your enemies to defeat.  Do this by deciding how much ammunition you want to shoot with and rolling for success.  If they aren't sunk already your enemies will fight back! This happens at each position of the journey until you complete the 7th step.  If you are still in one piece then you have been successful.  The game ends when all of the journey are completed and you have made it back alive.  How do you win?  Firstly, a basic win is that you have been able to get through the journeys and made them all home successfully.  On top of that you may be in for recognition, depending on how many foes you have defeated, especially those pirates lurking in your way.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Could be a gigantic koala, a fleet of rampaging robots or an old lady with a rocket launcher &mdash; there's just no telling.&#10;&#10;Working together with the rest of the players, your goal is to navigate your way through the adventure, conquer any obstacle you encounter and make it to the end in one piece. Oh. and you'll want to keep an eye on that Tower of Peril too. Let it topple before you reach the end and it'll be game over for everyone.&#10;&#10;Unlike most adventure games, What Next isn't just about picking the right path. Buried inside these adventures, you'll find over 60 dexterity challenges, each one designed to stop you dead In your tracks. Want to grab a vine and swing from the trees? You'll need to throw a card into the air and catch it first. Decide to walk over that old rope bridge? Well, first you'll need to flick the wooden puck across the table, without it falling off. It's important to master every mini-game you come across in these adventures &mdash; or you might not make it to the finish line.&#10;&#10;The players turn over the next location card, read out the story and then choose which path to take next. If there is an event, the player reading the card must complete the dexterity challenge.&#10;&#10;The game ends when either the players reach the end of the adventure (win), or the tower of peril collapses (lose).&#10;&#10;"

Each player takes the role of a dream-diver trying to study the consciousness of their subject, while also acting as a subject trying to mislead and evade their diver.&#10;&#10;Players draft and build 12 card decks from a pool of 97 unique cards. These are Dream cards that they will be trying to hide from their diver, Dive cards that will define their methods of interpreting their subject's cards, and Lucid cards which will shape their overall strategy.&#10;&#10;Each player plays as a Diver, trying to find their Subject&rsquo;s valuable cards, and a Subject, trying to hide their valuable cards from a Diver.&#10;&#10;Lucid is meant to give all the fun and stimulation of a drafting + deck-builder, in far less time, and with all the sneaky clever moments of a bluffing game.&#10;&#10;Quick Rules Overview:&#10;&#10;Lucid has 3 card types. Every 12-card deck contains 4 cards of each type. &#10;Dreams - These are the cards you try to hide from your diver. &#10;Dives - These are the cards you use to interpret your opponent&rsquo;s cards, generally searching for dreams.&#10;Lucids - These cards give you a specific bonus while active, and can be resolved for a larger bonus when replaced by another lucid.&#10;&#10;Every round each player will:&#10;&#10;Draw 3 cards&#10;&#10;Prepare 3 cards:&#10;Place 3 cards in front of you face-down, in 3 positions. Outer, Middle, and Inner.&#10;&#10;Interpret one of their subject&rsquo;s cards:&#10;Your subject is the player to your left. You interpret one of their cards by flipping it face-up. You can do this by choosing any one of their 3 prepared cards, or by flipping up and following the instructions of a Dive card that you have prepared. Interpreting a card gives you resources and buries the card, disrupting your subject&rsquo;s plans. &#10;When you interpret a card, you will receive a bonus based on which position it was in.&#10;&#10;Swap Lucids:&#10;If you prepared a Lucid and your Diver did not find it, you can resolve your current active Lucid and replace it with the new one you prepared. You can also resolve your active Lucid and not replace it.&#10;&#10;Have a Dream:&#10;If you prepared a Dream and your Diver did not find it, you can reveal the Dream and do its effect.&#10;&#10;Clean up:&#10;Bury all prepared cards that are still face down and pass the first player token. If a player has 30 Insight, the game ends and the player with the most insight wins.&#10;&#10;(View the full rulebook on the Lucid Website)&#10;&#10;"
