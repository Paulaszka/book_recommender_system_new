By the moment, contrarily to my interest, the rules are by far not simple, ...im trying to improve that. I tried to achieve complexity by giving to the game a very chaotical and recursive nature. The board is defined in order to try to let an action to have infinite repercussion in the unfolding of the game. Its notable that, strictly speaking, the board doesnt have borders (as may be seen in the rules), so there is no &quot;preferential positions&quot;. Its interesting to note that the definition of &quot;loop&quot; does lead to literally infinite possibilities of combination in some cases (its definition is precisely the feature that has leadme to think that this game can be much more than just &quot;dificult&quot; for the computer...). And its interesting to note that wining implies to reduce this possibilities to one, that is, to reduce the number of possibilities, which is the thermodynamic definition of negative entropy. So you have to play with chaos to bring order.&#10;&#10;Equipment: &#10;- 9x9 Torus board with 9x9 square grid (a standard 9x9 GO board can be used, obeying the mechanic of the torus board), 18xwhite stones, 18xblack stones. (i decided this size mostly to facilitate initial playtesting. Of course the game can be played in larger boards)&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;1 - Game is played on the intersections. Adjacency is defined as orthogonal and diagonal (i.e. every intersection point has 8 adjacent points).&#10;&#10;2 - There can&rsquo;t be more than 18 total stones on the board at any time.&#10;&#10;3 - We will call &quot;piece&quot; to every single stone or loop. A piece is of the color of a player if every stone that composes it is of the color of that player. A piece is &quot;at range&quot; of another if they shares at least one of their adjacent intersections.&#10;&#10;4 - We will call &quot;loop&quot; to every group of pieces (regardless of color) where every piece is at range of at least another two pieces of the group (nothing prevents loops for sharing pieces). Its implied by the rule, but to clarify: If a piece A is composed by all the stones that composes a piece B, and viceversa, then A and B are the same piece, and B cant be considered has &quot;another&quot; piece for A, and viceversa.&#10;&#10;5 - We will say that a piece is &quot;conditioned&quot; to a player if its of the player color or if any group of pieces (regardless of color) that are at range of that piece conforms a loop.&#10;&#10;6 - A player makes a &quot;move&quot; by either:&#10;a) Taking a single stone of his color from the outside of the board and placing it in an empty place over the board.&#10;b) Removing a piece that is conditioned to him from the board.&#10;c) Removing a piece that is conditioned to him from the board, and then placing it back on an empty space on the board. If the removed piece is a loop, it has to remain a loop when placed back on the board.&#10;&#10;7 - At the start of the game the board is empty. Each player is assigned a color. Black plays first. Then both players play alternately. In his turn, a player can do one or two moves, if he has no legal move to perform the game ends, and he loses.&#10;&#10;"

The game encourages the use of &quot;deductive and abductive reasoning&quot; to assist in reducing the suspect list from 37 to 10 prime suspects, to ultimately identify the only possible killer. The objective of the game has two parts, concerned with discovering the identity of the culprit and having the incriminating evidence to hand!&#10;&#10;The game has 3 play formats - OPENplay (2-6), COVERTplay (2-5) or SOLOplay - and has Career, Group and Co-Op variants that provide ample choice in the way the game is played.&#10;&#10;The game set comes complete with; 5 Evidence Packs (labelled, ABCDE) a total of 300 cards; &quot;How to be a Deadcert Detective Guide&quot;; a Detective Checklist Pad (with 30 double sided sheets) and 25 Evidence Bags. Each Evidence Pack contains 3 &quot;evidence types&quot; - Victim; Crime Scene and Time of Death - that are used to define murder cases and provide details of the suspects. When the game set is initially opened, the Evidence Packs are each split into 3 Evidence type Packets and kept securely in their individual evidence bags. This will use 15 of 25 bags provided - more about the remaining bags later...&#10;&#10;At the start of a game - or &quot;murder episode&quot; as it is referred to - one of each type of Evidence Packet is selected in order to define the murder mystery to be solved. With 5 Evidence Packs this means there are 5x5x5=125 possible episodes that can be played out. With the crime defined, the 18 suspect cards for each evidence type are shuffled together to form the 54 cards in play. 48 of the cards hold information about the suspects - why they had motive, means or the opportunity to carry out the murder. The other 6 are the Snoop cards which play a slightly different role depending on the format being played, but in essence are used to mix up the game play and enable the transfer of suspect evidence between players (or detectives if you wish to fully embrace the experience).&#10;&#10;So what about the extra 10 evidence bags? Well 1 is a genuine spare, the other 9 however (and the extra compartment with the game set tray) enable you to safely store up to 3 expansion packs (labelled, FGH) sold separately. These Expansion Packs provide extra victims, crime scenes and times of death to the London mix and interlink with the existing packs. Not only do they increase the number of murder episodes possible, they do so exponentially. If all 3 Expansion Packs are added, 125 episodes expand to a potential 512.&#10;&#10;The structure of the game is unique, and is the first of it's kind to provide multiple realistic crime mysteries with a pure card game format - no solution book is required, the murderer is simply the only suspect to have had motive, means and opportunity.&#10;&#10;Unlike many card games, it does not lean heavily on the graphics. This, although potentially unpopular with many, is a deliberate move to help focus on the evidence, the textual content of the suspect cards. Font sizing, colouring and new sentences starting on new lines, has all been done to make the reading of the cards as comfortable as possible, to the widest audience as possible. Graphics play an important role in distinguishing the 3 card types, but that is their key role.&#10;&#10;The final aspect of the game, that is only set to emerge after playing a few episodes, is the detail and integrity of all the characters that are woven together through the multiple storylines. Any information gathered about a victim or suspect may come in use in future investigations and nothing learnt will be contradicted later by another card. In short, the interwoven stories, events and relationships have as much integrity as the knowledge that you have identified the killer correctly. There are no miscarriages of justice with Deadcert.&#10;&#10;Please note: The 15+ age advisory is for reason of content in the detail of the crimes committed, and is not associated with the difficulty of the game play.&#10;&#10;"

179571,,"Card game played with traditional deck of cards, with some small elements of poker.&#10;&#10;The deck is divided in two: Red Cards &amp; Black Cards.&#10;One player takes all the black cards, while the other takes all red cards. They will each play with their own deck throughout the whole game - never mixing them.&#10;Players will separate the face cards (J, Q, K) and keep them in their hands at all times. The rest are shuffled.&#10;&#10;Both players will pick 3 cards from their own shuffled deck.&#10;Immediately after, they will choose to play either Queen or King as their &quot;Warlord&quot; for that round. They will place 1 Queen or 1 King face down and reveal them at the same time.&#10;If a player has chosen a Queen, they can (but are not obligated to) discard 1 card from their hand and take 1 new one from their deck.&#10;If they have chosen a King, they can do this up to 3 times.&#10;The face card is kept in front of them.&#10;&#10;Now it's time for battle.&#10;Each player selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. They then reveal the card at the same time and lay it in front of them.&#10;This is done until the three cards have been played.&#10;The player with the highest ranking 'combo' wins the battle. Combos are valued similarly to poker, but only with 3 cards. Below is the ranking order:&#10;1.   3 of a kind&#10;2.   Straight (3 numbers in consecutive order)&#10;3.   Flush (same suit)&#10;4.   2 of a kind&#10;5.   Card (highest number)&#10;&#10;The winning player will take the defeated player's warlord and put it aside as a trophy.&#10;Game ends when one of the players runs out of warlords.&#10;&#10;Players can use their Jacks to surrender in a battle. Jacks can be played instead of a number card (with the same behavior - keeping it hidden until both players reveal their card).&#10;If a player surrenders with a Jack, he/she will lose all the number cards he/she has already laid down (not the ones in his/her hand), plus the Jack that triggered the surrender. But he/she will save their warlord.&#10;&#10;If there is a draw during battle (or two players play a Jack), nothing happens. Players take their corresponding cards and continue to the next round.&#10;&#10;Players must shuffle all their number cards after every round (except for the ones they have lost, of course).&#10;&#10;"

Players use their cards to perform one of the following actions during their turn: buy cards, fight monsters, or trash cards. Each player builds their own unique deck with their purchases. When a player buys a card, it is placed in their discard pile. When a player no longer has a deck, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the deck in which players&rsquo; draw their hands. Purchased cards are more powerful than the ten starter cards and help players fight monsters. Players may choose to thin down their deck by trashing cards in order for more powerful cards to be drawn more frequently.&#10;&#10;Players have the option of gaining spells during their turn. Spells can be used at any point during the game to either aid a player during their turn or disrupt an opponent&rsquo;s turn.&#10;&#10;When a player fights and defeats a monster, the player gains a pixel related to the color of the monster. These pixels are a reusable resource that enhances players&rsquo; cards. When a player defeats a boss, they also gain points based on the monster&rsquo;s rank.

The game is to be played by 2 - 6 players and each round can take up to twenty minutes. The object of the game is to be the first player to get a Flush, thus winning the round.&#10;&#10;So the story goes, after the death of the Jabberwocky the residents of Wonderland had a lot of stress off their shoulders. The game was created by the Mad Hatter to give people something to do with their newly found recreational time. With this new lack of stress, they needed something to help become stressful again, this was the answer to that dilemma. After Alice's Adventure Underground, the Hatter decided to create the game using Aluette designs, that consists of no queen cards nor the suit of hearts. He thought this best since everyone was still getting over the events, but did like the idea of the added stress. Initially the game was designed for three rounds, but that did not deem stressful enough and has been increased to five rounds. The winner of the round is simply the first to get a Flush (cards with all matching suits), the player with the most wins in the five rounds--keeps the deck. Only one deck exists in Wonderland so this was the best way to ensure everyone could own a copy.&#10;&#10;While Lewis Carroll may not have conceptualized this game in his works, we have taken it upon ourselves to do so. The majority of the cards in the game are traditional Poker Cards, the Action Cards include imagery from the original book and the artwork in the game is originally by Arthur Rackham.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;1. Cards are shuffled and scattered in a pool in the middle of the Tabletop.&#10;2. Each player grabs five cards from the pool.&#10;3.

The object of the game is to get a flush, once someone gets a flush they win the round.&#10;5. The best of five rounds is declared the overall winner.&#10;&#10;"

During the Prep Phase, players will allocate dice to different tasks, such as acquiring components to build rovers to explore the planet surface, building and deploying rovers, researching technology, or recruiting more Planeteers (represented by 6-sided dice). Players have a maximum number of Planeteer Interaction Points (or pips) that can be allocated amongst their available Planeteers. Once players have taken their actions in the Prep Phase, any remaining Planeteers go to the Flight Deck, and will become the Pilots for the rovers during the Action Phase.&#10;&#10;During the Action Phase, players will assign their Pilots to any rovers they have on the planet's surface. These vehicles can perform tasks such as moving around the planet, interacting with objects (like salvaging or mining for minerals), or attacking (other players or aliens). Each scenario has a certain objective to complete, and the player who does so most efficiently wins the game.&#10;&#10;One of the most unique aspects of Planeteer are the rovers. Rovers are built by stacking components (cardboard chits). Each stack has a hole in the middle to fit a die (the pilot). The die face will show how many actions are available for that rover. Actions are dependent on the components equipped. Each component stacks so that it's available actions (icons) don't overlap, so any icon showing is an action available for that rover.&#10;&#10;"

Pirates needed fast ships, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannon fire. Tradeoffs between strength and speed, often times, weighed heavily in the outcome of battles. In the quest for riches, pirates would seek to plunder hidden treasures and the ill-gotten gains of other captains. Treachery, betrayal, and danger beset even the most cunning captain. Do you have what it takes to command your ship and pillage enough doubloons to claim victory?&#10;&#10;Scourge of the Seven Seas is a competitive or cooperative game for one to six players, each commanding a pirate ship on the high seas. Captains travel in search of hidden treasure and ship upgrades while fending off attacks and bribery attempts. The first captain to claim twenty points of treasure wins!&#10;&#10;The object of Scourge of the Seven Seas is to be the first player to deliver twenty points or more of treasure to their home port. You score points by taking turns moving your pawn between home port and an island full of buried treasures. At the start of the game you are dealt five cards which you use to determine the initial speed and strength of your ship.&#10;&#10;On your turn you may search for treasure, deliver treasure to your home port, draw cards at a trade port, attack other ships, or attempt to bribe dock workers. As the game progresses, players may visit trading ports to draw additional cards to increase their ship stats. You can attack other player&rsquo;s ships to plunder their riches or discard cards to bribe disloyal dock workers and steal the treasures at their home port. Attacking can be risky as you might become the victim; whereas sneaking into a home port and bribing would best be done with a fast ship for your escape.&#10;&#10;There are many different strategies to win competitively. The goal in team or single player mode is for at least one player to gain twenty or more points of treasure before Davy Jones releases the Kraken. Each player chooses a ship from a fleet of six different ships (Galleon, Frigate, Man O&rsquo; War, Schooner, Corvette, or Sloop) with varying abilities. In cooperative mode, you and your team must do battle with Davy Jones as he tries to block you from delivering treasures.  All the while, a doom clock counts down to Davy Jones becoming strong enough to release the Kraken on your team.&#10;&#10;"

Union General George B. McClellan&rsquo;s steady advance up the James Peninsula threatened the Confederate capital of Richmond, and a Union victory here had the potential of ending the war. A massive fleet of powerful Union warships anchored the northern army&rsquo;s flank and protected their water-borne supply line.&#10;&#10;On March 8th a strange looking Confederate steam ship, one that looked like a floating barn roof to a Union sailor who witnessed it, accompanied by other more conventional Confederate warships, sallied forth to do battle. The CSS Virginia, an ironclad warship built on the hull of the captured USS Merrimac, proved impervious to cannon balls fired from the Union warships and nearby land artillery batteries. Victory seemed within the Confederate&rsquo;s grasp when action ended on March 8th, leaving two Union warships sinking and another badly damaged, with only slight damage to the Confederate vessels.&#10;&#10;The fighting resumed on March 9th, but the Union ironclad USS Monitor had arrived during the night and its commander intercepted the CSS Virginia when it steamed out for battle. The battle between these two ironclad warships was violent, but ended in stalemate, and the Confederate&rsquo;s ambitions were thwarted.&#10;Although inconclusive in military terms, this first fight between ironclad warships marked a decisive turning point in naval warfare.&#10;&#10;"

A better question is &quot;Why would two old wargamers who've played all the monster games design and play a game like this?&quot; Because it captures the ebb and flow of the East Front, it's playable in 2 hours, and the outcome is rarely decided until the final turn if the players are evenly matched.
