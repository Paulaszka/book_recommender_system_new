It was thought very little infantry would be needed.&#10;&#10;In the end, when the last Allied troops evacuated, the casualty count for both sides topped half-a-million. (And Churchill lost his job.)&#10;&#10;And yet, the big naval attack had almost succeeded. The Allies would not know until after the war ended how close they had come to achieving their breakthrough on the Dardanelles. It was the first of many &quot;what might have been&quot; episodes, where success was just one more push, one more aggressive movement away...in contrast to many times when failure was reinforced and repeated.&#10;&#10;Gallipoli is held as something sacred by the Australians and New Zealanders... as though they own it. The British would point out that the ANZACs made up less than 10% of the overall force and suffered less than 10% of the casualties. (But you can still get into a fight in Sydney if you talk like this!)&#10;&#10;A Fatal Attraction brings this campaign of tragedy and opportunity to life. The counters represent brigades, batteries, and ships, and players have the chance to do better than their historical counterparts, while gaining a greater appreciation for the difficulties faced by both sides, including supply shortages, command/control difficulties, and random events.&#10;&#10;With A Fatal Attraction, you'll find everything you need to understand Gallipoli except the smell and the flies.&#10;&#10;Published in Against the Odds magazine #20, August 2007&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1 week&#10;Map: Area&#10;Unit: Infantry Regiments/Brigades, Artillery Batteries and individual ships&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet&#10;One countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 12 page Game Rulebook&#10;Four pages of chart &amp; tables&#10;Complexity - Medium&#10;Solitaire suitability - Low&#10;Playing time - Up to 6 hours&#10;&#10;"

Your deck represents your Juggernaut.  Your opponent also has a Juggernaut. Your goal is to incapacitate your opponent&rsquo;s Juggernaut so your ground forces can infiltrate and overwhelm it before he or she can do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, you need to download and print out Juggernauts cards and build your deck.  Cards fall into general categories of power generators, attacks, defenses, and miscellaneous effects.&#10;&#10;At the start of a game:&#10;&#10;     Pick a standard polyhedral die to be your Juggernaut's Commander.&#10;     Draw cards equal to the number of sides on your Commander, plus three.&#10;     Lay out all but three of the cards in your hand face-down so that each card:&#10;         occupies one square in an imaginary grid, and&#10;         is adjacent to at least one card.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;This matrix of cards is your Juggernaut.  Face-down cards are inactive nodes and face-up cards are active nodes.&#10;&#10;Play during a game is simultaneous; you and your opponent go through the same phases in a turn at the same time.  You  start your turn by gaining 1 power (plus any additional from active cards in your Juggernaut).  You use power to:&#10;&#10;     Activate cards that require Power,&#10;     Increase the effectiveness of an attack or defense,&#10;     Maintain cards you want to keep&#10;&#10;&#10;After you gain power, you roll your Commander to see which card in your Juggernaut's matrix activates.  If you do not have an active card by the end of your command phase (this can happen if your Commander tries to activate a damaged sector, a neutralized card, or a card token), put an alert token on your deck. This means that your enemy&rsquo;s ground forces are approaching. Remove all alert tokens when you activate a damaged sector. If you have three or more alert tokens on your deck at the end of a round, enemy troops have infiltrated your juggernaut and taken control. You lose and your opponent wins.&#10;&#10;Next, you and your opponent reveal your active cards and resolve them.  Once cards resolve, you discard them, draw cards to replace them, then play cards from your hand to fill in the ones that you discarded.&#10;&#10;The mechanics are such that large Juggernauts with many-sided Commanders (d 12, d 20) have lots of &quot;hit points&quot;, but are easy to hit with attacks, difficult to get reliable results from, and vulnerable to accumulating alert tokens.  Small Juggernauts with few-sided Commanders (d4, d6) are difficult to hit and produce very predictable results, but have very few &quot;hit points&quot;.&#10;&#10;Juggernauts is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License.

Each turn players draw a single card, either from the top of the discard pile or from the top of the draw deck, and then discard a card from their hand.&#10;&#10;Melds are formed in a player's 10-card hand and kept there until a deal is ended by one player &quot;knocking&quot; when he has few enough non-melded &quot;deadwood&quot; cards to &quot;go out&quot;: generally cards whose values total 10 or less (with face cards valued at 10 and aces low), though some variants value differently. The player that did not go out then has the opportunity to place his melds and &quot;lay off&quot; any of his cards that he can add to his opponent's melds. The values of the remaining deadwood are compared and the player with the smallest total scores the difference.&#10;&#10;If the player that did not go out's deadwood is the same or less than his opponent, he gets a 20 point (Variant: 25 points) bonus for &quot;undercutting&quot;; if the player that went out with &quot;Gin&quot; by emptying his hand without deadwood, he scores a 25 point bonus (and cannot be undercut, and the opponent cannot lay off deadwood to his Gin meld). The game continues with subsequent deals until one player's total score reaches at least 100. At that point, the winning player is awarded an additional 100 points (he also doubles this score if his opponent has not won a hand).  Each player then scores an additional 25 points for each hand won. The winner is the player with the most points. (Numerous variants and much regional variation occurs in the values assigned to these scores, and many bonuses and additional variations in scoring exist.)&#10;&#10;Gin Rummy is distinguished from Rummy in general in being a &quot;knocking&quot; game in which melds are retained in the hand until the end of a deal, and in which it is possible to &quot;go out&quot; without completely emptying one's hand. It is distinguished from games like &quot;500 Rum&quot; in that only deadwood scores.&#10;&#10;In Spanish-speaking countries, the game is played with the Spanish deck and it's typically called &quot;Chinch&oacute;n&quot; or &quot;Txintxon&quot; (in Spain) and &quot;Conga&quot; or &quot;Golpeado&quot; in Uruguay and Peru, respectively.&#10;&#10;"

It was the last attempt to &quot;spill American blood&quot; in large quantities. Politically, the January attack was a success as the American media heavily reported it. Militarily, it had totally failed in the assigned objectives. For the August offensive, the NVA concentrated two divisions, the 5th and 9th. The 5th had grown to 15,000 men and elements of the plan called for the capture of American M113 APCs from the 10l ARVN squadron to infiltrate into the US headquarters for it's destruction. The plan also called for the divisions to be used piecemeal with the objective of killing Americans and occupying Tay Ninh City. Such an event would reap a political bonanza equal to the Tet Offensive. It was thought this would decimate US morale because War Zone C was well occupied by American troops. More important to the NVA plan was the hope that the awesome American airpower would be neutralized by the August monsoons. For the next 11 days, a hectic, fierce battle strung out the Americans and their M-48 tanks. When the NVA occupied over five city blocks of Tay Ninh, it was the worst nightmare for the US.&#10;&#10;Game contains:&#10;2 11x17 inch maps (which combines together)&#10;280 counters&#10;Player aids, charts and tables.&#10;&#10;Scale: company and platoon level, each hex 1/2 mile, each turn one day for a total of 11 turns.&#10;&#10;"

The game is won when a player completes a wall separating all of their live pieces from all of the opponent's live pieces, or the opponent cannot make a legal move, or a player freezes the opponent's last live piece.
