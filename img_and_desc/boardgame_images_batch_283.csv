On each turn, each player must move his stone. The stone moves similar to a chess Knight, but in two steps rather than one. First it moves one (two) cell(s) in one direction, then two (one) cell(s) orthogonally (hence each player has two moves per turn). All positions moved to or jumped over turn into an impenetrable barrier for both players (i.e., they cannot be moved into or jumped over).&#10;&#10;Whoever leaves his opponent with no move first wins.&#10;&#10;"

When the player cannot do this, they take the sum on the remaining red dice as their penalty score (blanks count 20 points). When the player manages to get rid of all red dice, they subtract 10 points.&#10;&#10;When a player reaches 100 points or more, he/she has to drop out. The last surviving player is the winner.&#10;&#10;"

Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower.  You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities.  There are six types of Industry tiles:  Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks.  Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).&#10;&#10;Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.&#10;&#10;The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.&#10;&#10;There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.  Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them.  If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market.  Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price, reflecting increased supply.&#10;&#10;As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points.  The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game, i.e., the player with the most valuable combination of Industries and money, is the winner.&#10;&#10;How will you build your Nation?&#10;&#10;"

Each player starts out by choosing four characters (repeats are allowed), and designates one as the leader. Your leader has an initial health point (HP), border value (BV) and evasion value (EV), which will be used throughout the match, as well as some special abilities. Your starting spell point (SP) is zero. The other characters are to allow you access to other cards; the character requirements can be seen at the top of each card.&#10;&#10;After you've picked your team, you get to choose 40 cards (duplicates are allowed up to a total of three) that comprise your deck. Obviously you will pick cards that you can actually use.&#10;&#10;You will keep track of your HP and SP using counters. The game ends when one person's leader's HP drops to zero or when his or her deck has been depleted.&quot;&#10;&#10;"
