At that time, as his forces are completing the conquest of Poland, Hitler receives a flash of intuition. That is, he can&rsquo;t help but notice the strategic paralysis of the Anglo-French, who do nothing to try to prevent the downfall of their fast-disappearing eastern ally Poland. From that he concludes it would be a waste of time to redeploy the Wehrmacht to the western front in 1940. He tells his generals: &ldquo;The time will never be better to destroy the Bolshevik power than in the coming year. We will continue to have nothing to fear in the west. The British and French simply do not want war; they are afraid of it. Once we&rsquo;ve taken Moscow, we&rsquo;ll take Paris and London by telephone.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;Accordingly, he also tells his foreign minister to drop all negotiations aimed at revising the original territorial split set out in the accords with the USSR the previous month. Most importantly, Lithuania, originally in the German &ldquo;sphere of interest,&rdquo; is not traded for a further slice of Polish territory.&#10;&#10;All of which has resulted in this low-complexity, strategic-level, alternative history wargame. In it, two to four players can investigate the possibilities inherent in a changed German strategy for 1940. The West Front map is scaled at 16 miles per hexagon. The Eastern Front map is scaled at 25 miles per hex. All Soviet units are armies; all other forces in the game are corps. Each game turn on both maps equals half a month.&#10;&#10;This game can be played by two, three or four. If two play, one commands the Germans, while the other commands both the Anglo-French and Soviets. If played by three, one player commands the Germans, one player commands the Anglo-French, and the third commands the Soviets. If four play, one player commands the Germans on the west map; the second commands the Germans on the east map; the third commands the Soviets, and the fourth commands the Anglo-French. The rules contain some 17,000 words, which means experienced players can finish it in about four hours.&#10;&#10;Rules cover such things as: neutrals, fog of war, airpower, 7th Flieger Corps, Soviet 1st Shock Army, fortifications, and more.

As your intrepid adventurers delve through the ruins, they will face deadly traps guarding the ancient relics they prize.&#10;&#10;User Summary:&#10;&#10;A very light dice-roller, basically a fun simulation of Indiana-Jones-style temple robbers. Players move through a Mayan temple, risking constant death while trying to get to the exit, carrying as much treasure as they dare. The more treasure cards you have, the fewer actions you might get this round. If your character gets killed, a second one can drop in and you may still get enough treasure and escape to win.&#10;&#10;The temple starts with a room of crushing walls, leading into a winding passage that takes you past a lava pit and locked alcoves. The passage goes on, with two short-cuts that might save you time; a fast river or a rickety wooden bridge. You must balance attempts to grab treasure from the rooms, as you pass through, with staying ahead of a massive boulder, tumbling down the passage after you. If you have to let the boulder pass or be crushed to death, then you're forced to jump in the river and risk drowning just to get ahead. Otherwise, the boulder reaches the exit before you, blocking it and you're trapped forever.&#10;&#10;A mix of very basic lucky dice-rolling, lucky card draw for the treasure, and some decision-making about possible risks. Beautifully produced, with 12 small but detailed plastics miniatures, and an exotic and deadly temple. Adults may tire from repeats of The Adventurers, but kids will get lots of thrills.&#10;&#10;"
