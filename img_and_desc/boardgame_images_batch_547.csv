The main player for the turn selects three cards from his hand and lays them down, describing his character &ndash; for example, for a male character: &quot;war weapons collector, spends his holidays in Kazakhstan, likes movies about gladiators&quot;. Then each other player must select three cards from his hand and convince the main player that she (or he) is his best match. The main player then selects the turn's winner.&#10;&#10;Speed Dating feels like a minimalistic and hilarious role-playing game, or like an adult version of Once upon a Time, or a more involved version of The Big Idea.&#10;&#10;"

In the center of the once great citadel stands a stone temple. Local legends tell of great treasures that lie buried beneath the temple, but despite many weeks of searching no doorway has been found.&#10;&#10;On the top of the temple stands a square stone altar. A small totem stands in the center of this, surrounded by a pattern of sixteen carved tiles. Examining them closely you discover an intricate series of mechanisms which allow the tiles to switch places and turn over, which reveals that each tile has a stone side and a gold side. Carvings on each side of the pillar indicate that a sequence of four key patterns must be made with the tiles to open the temple. Can you be the first to unlock the secrets of Codinca?&#10;&#10;In Codinca, each player has control of a set of four matching symbol tiles: Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Players take turns attempting to move their tiles into a series of four specific key patterns indicated on the key discs drawn at the beginning of the game; those patterns are a block of four, a line of four, four corners (can be four corners of any nine tiles as well as outside corners) and a diagonal line of four.&#10;&#10;On each turn a player must either switch and flip one of their own tiles with any adjacent tile, or switch one of their tiles with any adjacent tile and switch the same or another of their tiles with any adjacent tiles or flip two tiles, one of which must be one of their own tiles. In addition, players are allocated three Spirit Card that gives them the bonus move choice of Line Push or Rotate Four. This allows players to disguise their planned moves. On the back of the Spirt Card is a Trap Pattern. This can be used to change a set display of tiles from gold to stone and visa versa to match the pattern on the Trap Pattern. Players can match their required patterns in any order, and the first player to match all patterns wins.&#10;&#10;"

Missing a prey animal means that the higher animal type starves, which gives you penalty points as a wildlife manager. Thus, you want to maintain all species in your wildlife park, especially the rarest species as they give you prestige points.&#10;&#10;In each of the eight game years (i.e., rounds), you can add 1 or 2 animal groups to your park; each group first consists of 1-4 animals of one species. When you attract them to your park, these are young animals. They can grow old and die naturally after five years, but to do this they need enough prey to feed on during their lifetime. Otherwise they starve. At the same time, higher predators in the food chain can eat these animals.&#10;&#10;An animal's age is shown by its location on your lifetime track, which uses four sticks to divide the track into five sections (i.e., years). After each year, you shift your rightmost stick to the leftmost side, which ages all of your animals by one year.&#10;&#10;When you don't have all four different species, you gain one penalty point per missing species (and higher level animals may starve). If you have the most (or second-most) of an animal which was rare before, you score 1-2 prestige points. After year eight, you add the number of your animal groups to your prestige point total to calculate your final score.&#10;&#10;The challenge in Tricky Wildlife is to balance your desire for prestige points with the need to preserve your complete food chain.&#10;&#10;"

It is played on a traditional 8x8 Checkers board with stones that are suitable for Bashni, i.e. stackable and with kings being turned men or pieces of a different color, as most traditional Russian sets are.&#10;&#10;The rules follow Bashni. In short, when a man or king is captured, it is not taken from the board, but put under the piece which captures the men. This way, stacks are formed. Generally, to topmost of piece of a stack decides which player the stack belongs to, how the stack moves, it is the piece that is promoted on reaching a back rank, and it is the piece that is captured. If the topmost piece of a stack is captured and the next piece at the top belongs to the opponent, the stack switches allegiance and belongs to the opponent then.&#10;&#10;The difference to Bashni is that pieyes are shared - as in Stavropol Checkers. A player may move stacks owned by the opponent, too, according to the rules for the topmost piece. The exact winning condition is therefor: a player loses when it is his turn and the stacks belonging to him have no  legal move.&#10;&#10;Online play:&#10;&#10;     igGameCenter&#10;&#10;&#10;"

The game proceeds until the sips catch up with you (which is the point of Bresee's more notorious game &quot;Pass Out&quot;) or until everyone has removed all articles of clothing.  The game suggests the last player to remove the last article of clothing is the winner, but local rules may suggest other winners may be declared.&#10;&#10;The length of the game depends greatly on potency of beverages, how many articles of clothes players are wearing, and natural distractions that arise from game situations.
