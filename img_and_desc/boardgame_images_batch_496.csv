Life as we know it struggles to endure on the Abaddon. Once the home of a mysterious, non-human civilization, the planet is now a desolate wasteland bearing one immensely precious resource: Feronium power crystals. The unimaginable energy contained within the crystals is coveted by two groups of humans: the Satellite City-States and the Commonwealth Alliance. Using Links &ndash; giant bio-mech suits made from modified military vehicles and alien technology &ndash; the warring factions fight a weary battle for territorial control of the Abaddon.&#10;&#10;At your disposal in Abaddon is a 28&quot; x 19&quot; battlefield game board with 32 highly-detailed mech figurines, 18 free-standing landscape terrain features, over 100 game-changing Wild Fire and Weapon System cards, dozens of tokens, battle dice and a Battle Manual containing over 15 mission scenarios. Choose your allegiance and lead your army in non-stop excitement as you forge through unforgiving terrain, fight to overcome random and bizarre technological glitches, and battle your enemies in never-ending war.&#10;&#10;Abaddon is a furious, two-to-four-player game of futuristic combat. Each scenario is laid out on the customizable battlefield game board with each side using a varying number of units. The game is played in turns during which a player rolls his Activation Dice, allowing him to &quot;activate&quot; certain units and move them. These mechanical units &ndash; Links &ndash; are powered by Feronium power crystals, and as they take damage these crystals are depleted. A unit that runs out of crystals is unable to continue functioning and is considered destroyed.&#10;&#10;Combat is card- and dice-based. The attacker lays out his Weapon System cards, targeting defending enemy units. Once the attacker has laid out all of his planned attacks, the defender may defend with his own Weapon System cards. These cards can modify the dice rolls that are used to determine the results of the combat. Additionally, due to the experimental nature of the Links and the mysterious happenings in the Abaddon region, things can, and often will, go wrong. These malfunctions and odd happenings are represented by Wild Fire cards, the drawing of which can result in anything from possible shutdowns to anti-gravity surges.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined based on stipulations presented by the chosen mission scenarios. Typically, victory is achieved by damaging and destroying your opponent's units by way of their power crystals. Each destroyed enemy crystal is worth one victory point, which players must collect in order to win.&#10;&#10;"

In Research phase players can pay to research, or choose to license another players tech. In the Fleet phase players get one action with each ship they own. The Management phase is when players build new ships, special tech items, and sell technology to the public domain. The Revenue phase is when players collect their hard earned resources, including a small stipend from their home office on Earth. And finally, the turn auction phase is a bidding war for who goes first. Not that important at the start of the game, but monumental for the end.&#10;&#10;"

Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.  It was introduced by PLAAY Games in April of 2010.&#10;&#10;The game differs significantly from similarly-themed hockey games in a number of ways.&#10;&#10;First, it re-creates hockey action totally differently than existing games like APBA and Strat-O-Matic.  Rather than re-creating a hockey game pass-by-pass and shot-by-shot, HOCKEY BLAST re-creates the action minute-by-minute.  The game charts crystallize each minute's action, and a unique &quot;lull&quot; mechanism allows the gamer to fast-forward past uneventful minutes.  The result is a hockey game that plays quickly, yet captures all the nuances and excitement of real hockey.&#10;&#10;Second, HOCKEY BLAST realistically incorporates momentum and fights into the game play. In HOCKEY BLAST, a team plays better when it has momentum.  It can gain momentum in a number of ways--by landing a big hit, scoring a goal, making a spectacular save, or having one of its players win a fight. In other hockey games, fights can occur, but have no real effect on the game other than to send participants to the penalty box.  In HOCKEY BLAST, the classic hockey &quot;enforcer&quot; persona has a real role, just as in real hockey.&#10;&#10;Another way HOCKEY BLAST is different is that it provides fans with instructions on how to rate their own players and teams.  The company encourages this, and even posts user-created card sets for free download on its website, www.plaay.com.&#10;&#10;The game comes in a two-piece labeled box with a game book that contains all the necessary charts, a hockey rink game board, a set of strategy cards, dice, markers for momentum and penalties, an instructions booklet, scoresheets, and two sample teams.  Full player card sets based on historical pro hockey seasons are available, along with a fictional player card series that is updated annually.&#10;&#10;"

They can be opened and closed, although it's typically more difficult to close them. Once seven Seals are open, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest combat strength (excluding levels) is the winner. The Seal mechanic adds a sense of impending doom to the game, meant to mimic the sense of impending doom for a real apocalypse. It also tends to create situations where the group works together to close a Seal in order to prevent a player from winning via the Seal mechanic. So there is more teamwork than in a regular Munchkin game.&#10;&#10;The balance of the deck is also different than the other Munchkin sets. There are a lot more Disaster cards, which are equivalent to traps and curses, so bad things tend to occur more frequently. Also, there are more monsters, especially high-level monsters. To offset this, however, there are more item enhancers and high-bonus items. It's been stated in the Munchkin forums that Munchkin Apocalypse is harder to play and is intended more for seasoned Munchkin veterans.&#10;&#10;Munchkin Apocalypse has four new classes but does not have races, powers, or other &quot;thingies&quot;. It includes Undead and Shark monsters, which follow special rules.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 180 cards (92 Doors, 76 Treasures, 12 Seals). The Seal cards are a different size than the regular cards--they're square and are shorter but wider (2.75&quot; x 2.75&quot;). The included d6 is orange with lime green pips, similar in color to the orange dice in the +6 Bag o' Radioactive Munchkin d6.&#10;&#10;"
