In this quick-draw classic, the guesses can be just as hilarious as the sketches, making it the perfect way to get the party started. Pictionary now includes two erasable markers, boards for drawing, and an updated Pop Culture category of clues. Year after year since 1985, Pictionary has proven itself to be the ultimate party game! Each sold separately, subject to availability. Colors and decorations may vary.&#10;&#10;Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers. In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer. When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers. No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances. A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition. Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.&#10;&#10;"

You play the monarchist Coalitions, led by Britain, and the game's A.I. plays Napoleonic France.&#10;&#10;The game is grand-strategic; each turn covers an average of two years' real time. Your goal is to force Napoleon to abdicate, through a combination of military defeats in Europe (using your armies), and military/diplomatic defeats overseas (spending cash and diplomatic assets in a series of semi-random overseas campaigns including Ireland, Egypt, the Balkans, Senegal and the War of 1812). At the end of Turn 16 (1818-1821), if you have not defeated Napoleon, then Napoleon dies of natural causes and an exhausted Europe makes peace with his son, and you lose the game.&#10;&#10;As a solitaire game, it is full of random events and unexpected challenges for the player, as you -- the British -- attempt to hold your unwieldy coalition together and prioritize your various budgets to win naval battles, overseas campaigns, and subsidize the various minor states of Europe whose armies are key to victory.&#10;&#10;"

Series, where  the Russian Front of World War II was first simulated,  then taking the action to the African Front, the Italian Front , the French &amp; Polish Fronts, game designer Carl Paradis now presents the fifth chapter: No Retreat 5: The Western Front 1944-45.&#10;&#10;After the Fall of France in May of 1940, the Battle of Britain put a stop to Hitler&rsquo;s ambitions in the West. While his attentions turned eastwards towards the vast expanses of the Soviet Union, the German Army, occupying most of Western Europe, started fortifying the coastlines to defend the Nazi dictator&rsquo;s conquests against the resurgent Allied might: the vaunted &ldquo;Atlantic Wall&rdquo; was born. Soon, Allied troops will be knocking upon its doorstep&hellip;&#10;&#10;In No Retreat 5, players command the Allied or German forces, invading or defending West Europe: France, Belgium, Holland and Germany proper. Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 20 kilometers across, over turns that each represent between a week to a month of real time. The No Retreat series card-assisted game system is there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable, and also manages the pre-invasion &ldquo;fog-of-war&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The game is split up in two different parts.&#10;&#10;The Invasion Game:  Starting in 1943.  It will consist of the preparations preceding the Allied Invasion of Western Europe, with deception, intelligence and build-up efforts being showcased. The D-Day outcome is then gamed using intense weekly turns.&#10;&#10;The Front Game: After the Allies are ashore, their beachhead secure (unless they are pushed back in the English Channel!), the rest of the game consists of monthly turns simulating the War in the West, up to the bitter end and probable surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945; the longer the game lasts, the stronger the Soviets position will be in Central Europe, or perhaps Hitler will be able to stave off total defeat long enough for an armistice and negotiated outcome?&#10;&#10;The D-Day sea invasion will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, with both players having to choose where to deploy their assets, where to attack, and what kind of troops to use and request from higher command. As the German commander, will you ask the OKW for more Panzers, or more bunkers and guns; will you gain full control of your mobile troops, or will you have limited control, as historically happened? As the Allied commander, will troops fighting in Italy be released to you for an end-run South of France invasion? Or perhaps you will decide to invade the Low Countries instead, trying to capture the important port of Antwerp in a surprise operation?&#10;&#10;A simple but effective supply system will show the constraints the victorious Allied Armies suffered for a good part of the campaign after breaking out of their invasion beachhead. Special Event cards will simulate effortlessly the events happening on the Eastern Front, the effects of the strategic bomber offensive, the political pressures put on both players&rsquo; operations by their respective leaders, etc. Will Hitler let you use the Panzer reserves in time? Will Churchill make a bit for a more upfront role for the British units? Will Heavy Bombers be released for more tactical uses? All this and more will be shown and simulated. Embark in your Landing craft, keep watch in your concrete Bunker, the Invasion is coming, and there will be No Retreat!&#10;&#10;Western Front Scenario Listing&#10;Regular Campaign Game: The Invasion Game, followed by the Front Game. Players will thus have a lot of leeway in their initial Strategic Choices. What if the Allies had invaded in le-pas-De-Calais instead of Normandy? What if the German Panzers were moved closer to the beaches?&#10;Historical Campaign Game:  The Game starts with the Invasion game already pre-set, and the Normandy landings. Historical OOBs only.&#10;Invasion Game Scenario: Only the first part of the game is played up to the resolution of the D-Day Invasion. Depending on its level of success, the outcome of the rest of the campaign, and victory is then determined using a set of special tables.&#10;Front Game Scenario: Only the second part of the game is played, starting with the Normandy Breakout.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;One 22x34 Mapboard (mounted and two-sided) &#10;Two sheets of 88, 2-sided square units (176 Total) &#10;One sheet of 112, 2-sided round/hex markers.&#10;One rule book (40 pages)&#10;One Scenario Book (24 pages)&#10;Six Play-aid cards&#10;Two decks of 55 Event Cards &#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;Scale: Each unit is one Division or Corps: Each hex is about 20 kilometers from side to side for the main campaign map, smaller for the Invasion map. Each turn represents a week (Invasion) to a month (Campaign) of real time.&#10;&#10;"

The deadly virus they escaped from tags along and threatens the last few of the human race. Your goal is to survive the infection and become the individual with the best prospect for humanity's second chance.&#10;&#10;13 Survivors is a micro card game with a constant state of flux. Each card can flip the outcome of the game on its head at any moment. Playing the right card at the right time is crucial for your survival.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is finish each round with the best possible card (either high or lowest numbered card). A random card is removed every round, which varies the game-play and makes the outcome harder to predict. It is a game of tactics, mind-reading your opponents and a bit of luck.&#10;&#10;The game is played in either 3 rounds (short game) or 7 rounds (long game). On the very first round, the oldest player goes first. On subsequent rounds, the previous round&rsquo;s winner goes first. On his turn, a player MUST play a card and do its action (unless it's his last and only card, in which case, he passes automatically), after a card&rsquo;s action is complete, it's discarded to a face-down DISCARD pile. Then it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn clockwise. The highest-numbered card is normally the best, unless this rule is reversed when the Mathematician card is played.&#10;&#10;When all players have only one card left each, they all reveal their cards simultaneously. All and any players with INFECTED cards gain NO points. SURVIVORS win points according to the numbers they end up with, and whether it&rsquo;s the highest or lowest number that wins the current round (see Mathematician card). Best-result player wins 3 points. Second best-result (if any) wins 2 points. Third best-result (if any) wins 1 point. Fourth survivor (if applicable) wins nothing. After the final round, the player with the most total points wins the game! In case of a tie for the first place, play an additional round.&#10;&#10;"

It has a folding thin cardboard field and 18 small wooden player disks (9 blue, 9 red). While there are circles on the field and bench for these pieces, their only real function is to mark baserunners.&#10;&#10;To bat, players simply roll 2D6, and read the resulting play off a 2-12 table in the rules. The odds are not realistic: the most likely result (7) produces a double, and a batter will get on base almost half the time (17/36). Normal baseball rules apply, with the player scoring the most runs after nine innings winning.&#10;&#10;"

The standard football was made more pointed at the ends in 1934 to make it easier to pass, but the new shape made drop kicks much less reliable, and almost all scoring attempts since have been place kicks.&#10;&#10;The game uses the sum of 2D6 to resolve each play. The offensive player has 10 play options (Left End, Left Tackle, Left Guard, Center, Right Guard, Right Tackle, Right End, Spinner Play, Trick Play and Pass). Each of these plays, along with Drop Kick, Place Kick, Punt, Punt Return, Kickoff and Kickoff Return) has its own results column showing yards gained  or lost along with possible fumbles and interceptions.&#10;&#10;The board has an unusual mechanism for recording the game's progress. It comes with just two pawns, one for recording downs, the other the number of plays. The field has four groups of lines stretching from one end of the field to the other to mark the downs (single, double, triple and quadruple lines), and the ball marker is moved from one to the next to mark downs as well as back and forth to show line of scrimmage. The second peg marks off plays at the end of the board, with a quarter ending after 25 plays and the game after 100. Usual football scoring applies, with most points after 100 plays winning.&#10;&#10;"

The sets are between 2 to 5 tiles. You can even steal tiles from the other players if you can take a complete set. Then you flip the tiles over for the other side.&#10;&#10;The player with the most tiles when every tile is taken wins the round and gets a point-marker.

Over the next 60 years Chicago experienced an economic golden age, making such great progress that it hosted The World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, followed not long after by a celebration of its Century of Progress at The World's Fair in 1933.&#10;&#10;Many of the household brands we've come to know and love today had their start in Chicago during this time period; Oscar Mayer, Kraft, Quaker Oats, Nabisco, Swift &amp; Co, Armour &amp; Co, Schwinn Bicycles, Charles Schwab, and many others made a home here in this tall, bold slugger.&#10;&#10;In City of the Big Shoulders players take on the roles of entrepreneurs and investors seeking to rebuild Chicago into a city fit for the world stage. In this unique merger of 18xx-style stock manipulation mechanics with euro-style gameplay, players start companies, trade in shares, hire employees, equip their factories, produce goods and sell them to be delivered to homes across the midwest.&#10;&#10;Although City of the Big Shoulders features a large amount of strategic depth and rewarding gameplay, it does so in a shorter timeline than is typical of most heavy economic games. Players play just five rounds (also known as decades) in about two and a half hours. Each decade consists of five unique phases: A stock phase where players can buy and sell stock; a building phase where players rebuild the city of Chicago, placing action spaces on the board; an action phase where companies send their partners to make deals across Chicago; an Operating Phase where companies buy resources, produce goods, and ship them out of Chicago; and finally a cleanup phase where the board is set up for the following decade. At the end of the fifth decade, the game ends. Players then exchange shares that they have purchased over the course of the game for cash, are rewarded for any of the public goals they have accomplished over the five decades of play, and tally their money to determine who is Chicago's greatest resident.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Another divinity shares your passion for these fruits, which leaves you only one choice &mdash; you need to show him your power in order to get more fruits than he does before the end of the fruit season.&#10;&#10;To set up, shuffle the nine village tiles and place them in a 3x3 square with some space between each tile. Players then take turns until the fruit supply exhausted or one of them collects four fruits. On a turn, a player creates a new totem (by placing one of their totem tokens on an empty village tile) or moves a totem that has one of their tokens on top. When you move a totem, you must move the entire totem orthogonally as many spaces as the number of tokens in it. As you move, you drop the bottommost token in each village through which you pass, placing the dropped tokens on top of any totem already located there.&#10;&#10;When a totem has three tokens stacked in it, the village it's in is influenced, with the player who owns the top token winning a number of fruits equal to the number on the village tile. After this, remove the tokens in this totem and return them to their owners. If a village has a 0 on it, then the tokens are returned with no one collecting fruit; if a village has -1, then the owner of the top totem removes one of their collected fruits from the game.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player has four fruit, they win.

Together, they will run it as a business (and keep it groovy), but they need to try a bunch of crazy things! However, the city's deadline is quicky approaching, so the group will have to try some pretty unorthodox methods to keep the CO-OP both profitable and groovy! They may even have to open the CO-OP to non-members!&quot;&#10;&#10;CO-OP: the co-op game is a cooperative, variable player powers, hand management, marketplace card game for 1-5 players ages 12 and up (although kids ages 10 and up can play with their parent's help).&#10;&#10;In CO-OP, all players assume the role of someone who works at the CO-OP (each with special powers).  Each player also has a VIBE track, representing how they are feeling today.  A global Money track represents how much money the CO-OP currently has.  To win, the CO-OP needs at least $10, and each player must be Groovy or Awesome on their individual VIBE chart.&#10;&#10;Since the CO-OP is a store, the usual way to make money is to sell goods to Customers.  There is a Storefront where the CO-OP stocks goods to sell to Customers.  When the Storefront runs out of goods, the CO-OP can move goods from the Warehouse to the Storefront a variety of ways.   When the Warehouse runs out of goods, the CO-OP has to spend some money with Distributors to get more goods.  CO-OP is all about balancing when to buy, move, and sell goods.  But also staying groovy!&#10;&#10;The game is broken up into days.  Each day, three things occur: A Happening, Players Turn, Clean-up.   A Happening at the start of the day sets-up today's challenge.  Then, each player gets a turn, usually playing a card.  These cards can be Customers (who buy goods from the CO-OP Storefront), Distributors (from whom we buy goods for the Warehouse), Instagroove cards (with instantaneous effect), or Continuous Groove cards (with lasting effects).  After each player plays, then we clean-up (doing end of turn maintenance).  And then start to the next day!&#10;&#10;The game is over when the Happening card GAME OVER comes out.  At that time, the players either win or lose (if they have enough money and VIBE).&#10;&#10;Players usually play cards on their turn, but they can also Meditate (to draw more cards), Frolic (cheer up their VIBE), Share (give cards back and forth with other players), and finally COOPERATE (work with other players).  A sample COOPERATE action is the Car Wash: you can't have a car wash with just one person!  There are limited number of COOPERATE actions, so they must be used strategically!&#10;&#10;Players can play in any order on their turn to augment another player's turn: this is called Player Selected Turn Order, but it just means you can play in the order that best helps the players!&#10;&#10;CO-OP is a game where players work together to discover the best way to balance VIBE, Money, Goods, and cards (Customers and Distributors).

The game takes place during Japan's rapid industrial growth during the Meiji era, where you take the role of one of the entrepreneurial railroad baron of that time.&#10;&#10;You plan and lay track, upgrade your trains, sell goods to distant cities, and use operation cards to become the richest railroad baron of Japan! Balance your budget wisely, since taking too many bank bonds can ruin your business over the course of the game. Also, watch the competition closely because you can only use the track that you laid down personally to trade.&#10;&#10;Since the island of Japan is mountainous and narrow there is often not enough space for everyone to lay their track where they want. Foreseeing your competitors moves and well thought out moves will ensure you an undisputed railroad empire!&#10;&#10;It was also released as an expansion, that required components from the base game: Railways of the World: Nippon Expansion.&#10;&#10;"

NVA expertise in lure and ambush tactics resulted in significant US casualties. US mobility and the ability to bring massive amounts of firepower to bear quickly virtually destroyed the attacking NVA division and forced a change in NVA tactics.&#10;&#10;This re-issue of GMT Games' 1990 CSR Award winning title that started it all keeps the original operational system, but streamlines to it to include innovative combat resolution integrating maneuver combat, close assault, artillery bombardment, and support from gunships and air sorties.&#10;&#10;Increased accessibility to primary and secondary source material has made it possible to make changes to more accurately represent both sides' unique capabilities without significantly altering or breaking the base game system. The major changes involve patrols, ambushes, landing zones, and the 1st Cav Brigade HQ, while minor changes tweak movement, combat, and coordination game mechanics to showcase radically different strengths and weaknesses the FWA and NVA force brought to the battles in the Ia Drang Valley.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Every game is guaranteed to offer unique and fresh challenges.&#10;&#10;During a game of Quest for Gaia, players will undergo multi-phased rounds.  They will start by allocating the resources available to them from technology, planets, and government.  Next, players will draw 7 cards from a communal deck, voting for who will be the galactic Chancellor (first player).  Finally, starting with the first player, they will choose major actions - Explore, Campaign, Market, Covenant, Revolt, Research, Espionage, and War.  The chancellor position is valuable as each of these major actions can only be taken once per round.&#10;&#10;Players will also have a variety of smaller, &quot;Minor Actions&quot; to take - Move, Build, Upgrade, and Attack. These actions are very quick and players can upgrade planets to give themselves more actions or discover leaders to give themselves various Minor action options.&#10;&#10;Points are earned throughout this process and the first player to reach 24 is the winner!&#10;&#10;"
