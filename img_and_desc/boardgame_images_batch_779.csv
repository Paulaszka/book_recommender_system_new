This marks the end of the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa and the stabilization of the front until the effort to take Moscow in Operation Typhoon in the fall.&#10;&#10;AfB features a small map area and a limited number of units, making it easily accessible for fast or competition play. The entire campaign finishes in 10 turns.&#10;&#10;Play begins with the German offensive in full bloom. The German player attempts to rapidly seize as much of the map (in the form of Victory Point locations) as he can. Speed is essential; while he has several cities to reduce, he knows the clock is ticking before Hitler pulls the plug on his efforts. The commanders did not realize this was in the cards, but for design purposes we assume the player feels the pistol pointed at his head. The Germans have copious air and mechanized forces to accomplish their goals...for the moment. At some point determined by the &quot;Hitler Roll&quot;, the German mechanized forces are taken off the map, their air support is cut in half, and the Red counteroffensive strikes in an attempt to turn things around.&#10;&#10;The Soviet player stalls, withdraws, and conserves his forces while letting the German offensive expend itself. As the high tide passes, he prepares his rebuilt Red Army for the second half of the game: the Soviet effort to blunt the German gains and recoup their losses as best they can.&#10;&#10;It that was first published in Special_Ops magazine #7 (2017).&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 6 days&#10;Hex: 7 miles / 11.2 kilometers&#10;Units: Regiment to Division&#10;&#10;Game Inventory (Special Ops edition):&#10;One 16 x 28&quot; full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)&#10;One 8-page Autumn for Barbarossa rules booklet&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 3-6&#10;&#10;"

The game board is a geographical map of an island called Ende. Players try to score victory points by constructing buildings and/or winning battles on the island.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, each player has a different set of four action cards, which varies by player order. Each round, they take turns playing action card until all players have taken three actions. At the end of round, they pass their set of cards to the player to the left.&#10;&#10;By performing an action, players may construct/upgrade a building, gain resources, raise military power, initiate a battle, etc. There are plenty of player interactions, such as limited nubmer of buildings in a territory and initiating a battle with a specific player. But battle is not always necessary to win the game.&#10;&#10;A player can win immediately by upgrading a building into the castle, but it requires much military power.

Each player starts the game with money cards valued 0-8, and at the start of the game, everyone chooses money cards that sum to 14 (with the 0 being included) and lays those cards face up on the table. Province cards equal to the number of players are revealed, and players take turns bidding on provinces by placing exactly one money card next to one province, outbidding an opponent if someone else has already bid there; if you're outbid, you take back your money card, then bid again on your next turn. Eventually everyone will have bid on separate provinces, after which you discard the non-0 bids, then lay out new province cards and run through two more rounds of bidding.&#10;&#10;Province cards show different numbers of pyramids, ankhs, and fields, with a caravan possibly being visible as well. Whoever has the most ankhs visible is Pharaoh, going first in each action with ties broken from the Pharaoh going clockwise.&#10;&#10;After three rounds of auctions, players will have some amount of money (possibly only the 0) still in hand. Everyone simultaneously makes an offering of gold, and the sum of the offerings determines how much the Nile floods, which determines how much money players will earn from fields. If the sum is 10 or less, players with caravans receive 10 gold per caravan. Whoever offers the most gold receives three pyramids to place on their province cards, with others receiving two and one pyramids.&#10;&#10;In player order, players determine their income level, then spend gold to build pyramids on their cards (distributing them as equally as possible), then they take money cards into their hand to account for any income not spent. They then score points for sets of pyramids, for having nine or more fields, and for having the most ankhs.&#10;&#10;The second and third rounds of the game play out similarly, except that when you claim cards following the auction, you place these province cards on top of your previous province cards so that only the imprinted and acquired pyramids are visible. Everything else is buried in the sands. You score again at the end of each of these rounds, then the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

But with values rooted in sex positive feminism and content that supports a wide variety of sexual interests and gender identities, the game is also very much not like most other &quot;couples&quot; games on the market.&#10;&#10;"

One player acts as the killer, secretly assuming the identity of one of the citizens of Venice and looking for opportunities to kill some of the others. The other players act together to unmask the killer's identity. Within the round limit, the killer must keep their identity hidden and complete their killings, while the other players must investigate the murder methods to discover clues leading to the killer's unmasking and stop these atrocities.&#10;&#10;Aside from the standard game mode, the game includes five scenarios that can provide players with more rules and story experiences.&#10;&#10;Game Playing:&#10;&#10;Stage 1: Flip Over Cards:&#10;&#10;At the start of this stage, the killer takes all the character cards still in play, shuffles them face down and places the pile in front of him.&#239;&#188;&#136;In the first round of a normal game, this will be all 13 character cards, reduced each round when the killer takes victims).&#10;Deal a number of character cards according to the number of players, then flip those cards face-up and place them in area easily reached by all players.  These will be the character cards availible for use this round.&#10;&#10;Stage 2: The Investigators Act&#10;Starting with the investigator to the left of the killer, that player chooses one of the availible character cards for this round and places it face-up in front of him or herself.  Once a character card has been placed in front of a player no other investigator may choose that card.  After placing the card infront of him or herself, the investigator can move that character according to the movement value on the card and one active ability on the card.  After the investigator finishes moving his or her chosen character and taking any actions, the next investigator clockwise repeats this process until all investigators have taken a character card.&#10;&#10;Stage 3: The Killer Acts&#10;The killer's stage consists of 2 parts: movement and murder.&#10;-Movement-&#10;The killer can choose from 2 options for movement&#239;&#188;&#154;&#10;&#10;     Use the remaining 2 character cards unchosen by the non-killer players.  The killer chooses what order to use these cards in.&#10;     Use 1 card in front of a non-killer player.&#10;&#10;&#10;After the killer has taken his or her movement action(s), he or she is ready to take a life.&#10;-Murder-&#10;The killer selects a killing code card from his or her hand, using its ability to end the lives of one or more characters based on the qualifications of the killing code card text.  Each round the killer can only make use of 1 killing code card.  Please refer to the killing code card section of this rulebook for further clarification.  The killer dons the mask, dramatically announces who will die, then lays that character's marker down in the block they were just alive in.  Search the character cards for the character killed and place that card face up on the grave marker from this round, then the killer places the killing code card that he or she used face down on top of that character card.  If multiple characters were killed at once, place them all on the same grave before placing the killing code card over them.&#10;&#10;Accusation Round&#10;After the killer has successfully killed 5 or more characters or has used 5 killing code cards, the game immediately enters a special final round called the accusation round.&#10;The final round is an additional round which only has the first 2 stages, the killer will not take any action in this round, instead he or she should don the mask, steeple his or her hands and watch the proceedings dramatically. When the investigators are finished moving in this round, they must immediately make an accusation.  The investigators may only accuse one suspect.  Various methods of reaching an agreement on this accusation include&#239;&#188;&#154;&#10;&#10;     Discussion&#10;     Voting&#10;     Arm Wrestling&#10;     Drinking Contest&#10;     Giving in to the Most Persuasive Who-Donnit Speech&#10;     Being Generally Louder than the Other Investigators&#10;     Agree with the Person you Secretly Find Attractive&#10;     Bribing, Coercing, or Torturing the Killer&#10;&#10;&#10;Or any additional methods which the design company assumes no responsibility for the consequences of.&#10;Or whatever, you know, it doesn't matter, just guess.&#10;&#10;Faced with this accusation, the killer must flip up his or her suspect card with a flourish.&#10;&#10;Victory or Defeat&#10;Complete the Accusation&#10;So close, yet so far very very wrong...&#10;No matter when it is made, if the accusation was correct, the investigators win.&#10;If the accusation was wrong, the killer wins.&#10;&#10;"
