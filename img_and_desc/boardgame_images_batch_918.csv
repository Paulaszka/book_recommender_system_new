Avigdor Kahalani famously engaged the Syrians in the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War at 3000 meters, and ranges stretched out even further in the Gulf War as computer-assisted fire control came into combat. Artillery support has become ever more mobile and fast reacting, with radar-assisted counter-battery fire. Air support is more nimble, too, especially once laser-guided munitions become commonplace.&#10;&#10;Core concepts are the alternating player turn, detection, and defensive fire during the active player&rsquo;s movement, and cohesion.&#10;&#10;Included in this title:&#10;&#10;     Complete Rule System, including vehicle and equipment charts covering 1945 to the present day.&#10;     Combat Tables&#10;     Game Counters and Artillery Templates&#10;     Sample historical scenarios&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
