Cards are numbered 1-13, with each number representing a book from the Book of Mormon. (The books of Enos, Jarom, and Omni are combined onto one card.) There are also four suits, Beehives, Buffalo Skulls, Seagulls, and Wagon Wheels. Players ask others for the cards they need to complete the &quot;Books&quot; by asking either for the name of the prophet pictured on the card (for children) or by quoting a scripture on the card (for advanced players).&#10;&#10;The rules make note that this deck of cards is appropriate for other standard card games as well.&#10;&#10;"

Players alternate moving their hunter pawn and a random deer pawn.  Cards are drawn depending on certain movement rolls that aid or hinder players.  When moving deer, players can move them toward their hunter, away from other hunters, or to another hunter and roll to attack the hunter and send him/her to the hospital.  Rolls also determine the success of hunters' attacks on deer.&#10;&#10;"

Players start in the middle of a maze.  Every turn a player picks a tile and connects it with the tiles already on the table and then moves his/her pawn if desired or possible.  Players attempt to keep their paths open and to block or trap their opponents with strategic placement of the wall tiles.  After the fourth exterior corner tile has been placed, tiles may be replaced as well as placed, and the exit tile is shuffled into the draw pile.  The first player to the exit tile when it appears scores zero points.  Every other player gets points depending on how far their pawn is when the exit is reached by anyone.  The fewest points after a number of rounds is the winner.&#10;&#10;The only board game to receive the Top Toy 2008 award from Toy Directory Monthly!

The daughters have three characteristics: Reputation, beauty, and education, all of which may increase and decrease in value during the course of the game.

A daughter gets married immediately when she has collected three cards of the same gentleman, and meets the gentleman's standards in each of the three characteristics.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a family marries all of their daughters. Points are scored from husbands, action cards, and also from majorities in each characteristic.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts different parts of a town, each of them with a different number of available gentlemen cards.&#10;&#10;A player's turn consists of:&#10;1. Moving to a different region of the town.&#10;2. Doing a region-specific action, or trying to scheme against another daughter in the same region.&#10;3. Drawing an action card.&#10;&#10;Region-specific actions usually mean choosing a gentleman card from those available, but sometimes also cause changes in a daughter's characteristics. Scheming against another daughter means trying to steal a gentleman card from them, by rolling a die. Action cards can be played anytime during a player's turn, and sometimes also as a reaction to cards played by other players.&#10;&#10;"
