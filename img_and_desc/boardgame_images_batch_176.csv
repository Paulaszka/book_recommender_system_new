(The Way to Draconia) is a card/board game  who each control a well-known adventuring group / race. Each race is comprised of typical RPG-style heroes. Each hero has special abilities that let him get ahead in the game. The game ends as soon as a hero reaches the goal space in Drakonia. The goal of the game is to move your heroes as far along the path as possible. Multiple cards in hand let the heroes slowly but surely move forward on the difficult path. Being with your own group naturally makes things move more quickly, but careful, other heroes might block your path. And faster than you&rsquo;d like, a hero might find himself injured on the side of the road or sent back to the start.&#10;&#10;"

The railroads earn money by operating trains between stations.  Player money is earned through dividends to stockholders.  Unlike the above mentioned games, the rails are drawn right on the map, and owned by the railroads who built them (As in Mayfair's Empire Builder system.)
