Your goal is to defeat your opponents to make the deity to whom you pledged allegiance proud.

Place it on any free space of the board, choosing its orientation. Then, draw a new Amulet Card to have 4 Amulet Cards in your hand again. You can either take an Amulet Card from the Deities&rsquo; Market, or draw a random Amulet Card from the top of the draw pile. If you take a card from the Market, immediately replace it with a new card from the draw pile.&#10;     You may cast one of the Rituals of your Deity Board (see Cast a Ritual on p.7). You can do this before or after placing an Amulet on the board. You can cast as many Rituals as you like. Casting a Ritual is not mandatory. &#10;&#10;&#10;Alternatively, you may decide to pass. This allows you to discard your entire hand of Amulet Cards to draw 4 new Amulet Cards instead.

Check if any player has completed their Exaltation Card (a secret secondary objective), then proceed to final scoring.&#10;&#10;Cast a Ritual&#10;There are two types of Rituals: Simple Rituals and Advanced Rituals. Players receive Simple Rituals at the beginning of the game. They are easy to cast but do not score many points. Players may draw Advanced Rituals during the game. These Rituals score more points. Each Ritual Card depicts the Amulets required to cast the Ritual.&#10;To cast a Ritual, you must make sure that the depicted Amulets are correctly linked to each other: An Amulet is linked to the adjacent Amulet if both arrows are face to face. There must be no other Amulets between the arrows of the Amulets required to cast the Ritual. There can be more Amulets than required, of course. In that case, simply indicate the ones that you are using. &#10;A Ritual allows you to gain Ankhs (as many as indicated on the card, in front of the matching symbol). However, casting a Ritual consumes the Amulets&rsquo; energy. For this reason, some of them need to be broken. Remove the Amulet(s) of your choice from the ones used for the Ritual and place them in front of you. &#10;Rituals can be cast according to two principles: Order OR Chaos. &#10;ORDER : Such Rituals score more points and break less Amulets &ndash; which means that more Amulets remain available for the other players. &#10;CHAOS : The black symbols depict the Chaos Principle.

In the Warhammer Age of Sigmar Core Book, you&rsquo;ll not only learn the rich history of this war-torn age, but you&rsquo;ll also find all the rules you need to evoke these epic stories on the tabletop.&#10;&#10;Realms of War&#10;&#10;The Core Book starts with Realms of War, an overview of the Warhammer hobby with concise how-to guides on collecting, building, and painting your miniatures, as well as the various ways you can use them to play games of Warhammer Age of Sigmar.&#10;&#10;War Unending&#10;&#10;Discover the history of the Mortal Realms in the first lore section of the book, containing a detailed, illustrated story-so-far, from the arrival of mankind's God-King to the savage Era of the Beast. This covers three major ages:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Age of Myth, Sigmar&rsquo;s journey through the cosmos, his meeting with the Great Drake Dracothion and his exploration of the eight Mortal Realms. It tells of his awakening of other gods, the building of civilisations, and the fractious alliances that were forged.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Age of Chaos, brought about by the machinations of the Chaos Gods and their command of the Realm of Chaos, spitting daemon legions forth and destroying the peace that once reigned.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The Age of Sigmar, in which the God-King's champions fight back against his enemies in all their forms. From the vengeful Realmgate Wars that cast Chaos back from many Order strongholds, to the cataclysmic Necroquake brought about by Nagash, God of the Dead, to the dawn of the Era of Beasts as the ancient Earthquake God unleashes hordes of rampaging greenskins into the heartlands of civilisation.&#10;&#10;&#10;Delve into background information on each of the eight Mortal Realms &ndash; Azyr, Shyish, Ashqy, Chamon, Ghur, Ghyran, Hysh, and Ulgu &ndash; which details their links, descriptions of the native civilisations that have risen and fallen, key events that have taken place and notable geographical features; along with details of the Realm of Chaos, a nightmarish dimension home to the Chaos Gods and legions of terrifying hellspawn.&#10;&#10;Clashing Empires&#10;&#10;Learn about the armies and alliances that fight across the Mortal Realms, each featuring a showcase of beautifully painted Citadel miniatures, split into four sections according to their Grand Alliances. Beginning with the forces of Order, you'll glean insight into each of the factions that comprise the last bastion of civilisation in the eight realms (even if they don't always get along), before moving on to parley with their nemeses in the forces of Chaos. Meanwhile, Nagash's alliance of Death plots to claim every last soul in the land, while Grand Alliance Destruction indulges their baser instincts on a roaring rampage of carnage alongside their newfound deity, Kragnos.&#10;&#10;The Rules&#10;&#10;The first rules section of this book contains the core concepts you need to start fighting battles in the Age of Sigmar, taking you through deployment, the battle rounds, combat, magic, and more. The rules are laid out in a clear and concise format with additional commentary from the designers, making this the easiest rulebook to reference in Warhammer history.&#10;&#10;Once you've got the basics squared away, find out all about the three core ways to play the game and the battleplans you can undertake in each.&#10;&#10;Open Play&#10;Let your imagination run wild as open play caters for re-enacting every kind of narrative storyline or tactical challenge you can think of, without restrictions.&#10;&#10;     Includes the Open War Battleplan Generator, which provides pre-set Maps, Victory Conditions, Twists, and Ruses.&#10;     Combining different options allows over 1,200 different types of Open War scenarios to be played.&#10;&#10;&#10;Matched Play&#10;Designed to put both players on an equal footing, matched play offers players an even chance of victory based around points-based army construction rules and a competitive set of battleplans.&#10;&#10;     Includes additional special rules, including Stealing the Initiative, as well as rules for additional objectives scored on either a turn-by-turn or end-of-battle basis.&#10;     Features much broader and more detailed requirements and restrictions than other game types, including restrictions on endless spells, reinforced units, and understrength units.&#10;&#10;&#10;Narrative Play&#10;Send your army on a Path to Glory and watch them develop across games with an overhauled section on narrative gameplay rules. Earn renown, gain new abilities, and even expand your army's territory while free of limitations on how, when, and where you can play.&#10;&ndash; Includes rules and guidance on a 5-step process to starting a Path to Glory campaign, including: Choosing Factions and Realms, Starting Sizes and Territories, Orders of Battle, Core Enhancements, and picking Quests to embark upon.&#10;&ndash; Provides guidance on how to fight battles against opponents both participating and not participating in a Path to Glory Campaign.&#10;&#10;Conquest Unbound&#10;&#10;The final section helps represent the vast array of battlefields and endless war that the overlords of the Mortal Realms fight across, including bespoke rules for the various, more niche type of battlefields you may come to fight, on, across, over, or indeed, under.&#10;&#10;It includes three variant types of games for players to enjoy, including:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Siege Warfare &ndash; all too often across the Mortal Realms, warlords and conquerors look to displace inhabitants of a territory or city that they have decided should fall under their control, and often the culmination of such a campaign is a brutal, no-holds-barred siege.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Triumph and Treachery &ndash; sometimes duty calls for an all-out brawl between all of your enemies at once, and, when that happens, these rules can be used to represent battles that take place between three or more factions at the same time &ndash; all are frantically fighting to win the day against all other opponents, but will you be the one to come out on top?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Tunnel Fighting &ndash; deadly, close-quarters combat is commonplace across the Mortal Realms as armies cluster into labyrinthine cave networks, perfidious skaven skitter through the city sewers, and mind-bending tunnels open up in the unpredictable domains of Chaos.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Core Book closes out with a handy, alphabetised rules index and a photocopiable Path to Glory roster, Order of Battle, and Army roster.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You versus your opponent. Each player randomly draws a character and a weapon. These cards have 3 different  traits (Speed, Power, and Finesse). These traits correspond to the dice you will use when battling, so a 4 is a d4, a 6 is a d6, and so forth. When you fight, you roll 1d4 to determine which attack you will use against your enemy.&#10;&#10;1 = Speed (Red). 2 = Power (White). 3 = Finesse (Grey). 4 = You choose the attack, or Roll to select again with a Bonus (Green)&#10;&#10;Since your weapon and character both have traits, you will actually be rolling 2 dice per attack. If a 1 was rolled on your 1d4 for attack selection for the round, you would use Speed as your attack. Your opponent might have a different trait they are using against you, since they also roll 1d4 to determine which type of attack they will use. You might have 1d4 for your character's Speed, but 1d8 for your weapon's speed. You roll these 2 dice together, add them together, and compare to your opponent's total from their 2 dice.  Damage is dealt in the difference between the two sums.&#10;&#10;Strategy comes from things like:&#10;&#10;Blocks - double your dice total but you can't damage your opponent. Typically you get 1 block per match, so use it wisely!&#10; Max Dice Damage - even if you're rolling 2D4 vs. an opponent's 1D8 and 1D10, you can still deal damage to them if you max out either or both of your dice! Whenever a character rolls the highest number possible on any die, they deal an automatic point of damage to their opponent. In this way, there is a chance to deal damage to an opponent even if you don't win the round.&#10; Weapon Bonuses - Most characters have 2-3 weapons they have +1 to dice rolls on if they have a matching weapon.&#10; Choice Bonuses - Each character can also get a bonus to attack rolls if they give up their choice when they roll a d4 and get a 4 for attack selection. If so, they roll again and have to take whatever they get, but they attack with a bonus on their rolls.&#10; Alternate Rules Cards - Putting one of these into play at the beginning of a match can totally change the game mechanics. With 36 different variations, it can really put a new spin on things! These are my favorite part of the game.&#10; Special Characters - 9 of the 27 characters have no weapon bonuses, but instead have special powers or abilities.&#10; 3-on-3 Elimination Matches - Continue fighting with your characters until they are reduced to 0 Hit Points, pulling a new character into the match until either you or your opponents have lost 3 characters.&#10; 3-5 Player Battle Royale Matches - Alternate rules for playing with more than 1 opponent. Last one standing wins!&#10;With all of these options, this becomes a great game for 2-5 players, whether you only have 10 minutes to play or an hour.  All it takes is 1 set of 90 cards, some standard RPG dice (D4/D6/D8/D10/D12/D20), and a friend!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

It&rsquo;s a simple card game that&rsquo;s easy to learn but packs a board game punch! Each player takes turns drawing from a shared deck containing cards from 3 distinct kingdoms, each with unique art and special abilities. Using these cards players build up their army to unlock additional actions and attack their foes using powerful combos. In Reinforcements, you can blast your foes with magic, hire deadly mercenaries, incite a peasant mob, and summon mythical totems. When two cards of the same power collide, it's time to call in REINFORCEMENTS! Both player&rsquo;s shout exuberantly and draw two cards from the deck to decide the battle. Do you have what it takes be the last player standing?&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a handful of five cards and three face-down Foundations (selected during setup). On your turn, you can do one of three things: use a card in your hand to Attack the lead card in one of your opponents &quot;stacks&quot;, Defend your foundations by adding a card that matches the suit of that foundation from your hand to the &quot;stack&quot;, or Discard as many cards from your hand as you want (you will fill back up to begin your next turn.)&#10;&#10;Once you add a third card to a stack, that stack is turned face up and you draw a card from the top of the draw pile to start a new foundation. Having a faceup stack will give you a bonus depending on the suit. A faceup stack of Blue cards allows you to Fortify which lets you take an additional Defend action on your turn if you have a blue card in hand that you can place. A faceup stack of Red cards allows you to Barrage your opponent by allowing you and additional attack on your opponent each turn if you have a red card in hand. Finally, a faceup Green stack gives you the ability to Adapt by either swapping a green card from your hand with a green card from the stack or swapping the position of two of the green cards in your faceup stack.&#10;&#10;Each color of stack that is face up grants you these abilities, so they can add up quickly and each color that's face up also gives you a passive ability: blue - your blue stacks may now have 4 cards instead of just 3, red - red cards that attack or Barrage automatically win all ties, green - your hand size increases by 1 for every faceup green stack in your army. Cards range in value from 1-7 and it's a basic war mechanic that higher card beats lower card, however if you win a battle (i.e. your six beats your opponents' two) any extra points carry on to the next card in the line (in the example you would have four points left to face whatever card was next in line.)&#10;&#10;If there is a tie both players yell REINFORCEMENTS!!! Each player MUST yell this when a tie occurs. This rule is non negotiable. Players draw the top card off of the draw pile and flip them until the battle is resolved. There are also some special cards that truly mess things up (Assassins, Mages, and mobs of Peasants) and if you flip two stacks of one color or one stack of each color (three stacks in total) one of the Totems will visit you and provide a special power. But you have to use it before an opponent completes their requirement and steals the Totem from you.&#10;&#10;"
