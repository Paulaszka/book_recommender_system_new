The first player takes a card from the Brainbox and turns the timer over. The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.&#10;&#10;"

At the start of the game, lay out 16 (of the 48) path cards in a 4x4 grid; each path card shows one of four types of landscapes. The ant player places six ants on these cards, one ant per card, with the ants forming a chain (as in real life), then secretly chooses one type of terrain on which at least one ant stands. The grasshopper player then stands with one of the ants, and if the grasshopper chose the same landscape as the ant player, the grasshopper takes all the path cards of this type on which an ant stands; if the grasshopper chose incorrectly, then the ant player takes these path cards. Either way, you then refill the 4x4 grid. The ant player keeps playing until she finally wins path cards, then the next player in clockwise order controls the ants. (In winter mode, the third and fourth players control red ants and receive a random path card if they match the choice of the ant player.)&#10;&#10;In autumn mode, players score path cards immediately, with each type being tracked independently; path cards that feature insects are saved for a endgame bonus. As soon as a player maxes out two scoring tracks, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In winter mode, players keep the path cards they collect in order to buy provision cards (worth one victory point), which cost particular combinations of path types. In this mode, when you win a path card that features an insect, you can claim another card in the grid that features the same insect. Collect both provision cards of the same type, and you score a bonus VP. The first player to collect 4 VPs wins.&#10;&#10;"

Earn tokens by going out first and being named the Pumpkin King.&#10;&#10;The goal of Mischief Night is to get rid of all of your cards as fast as possible. The 92-card deck contains 78 monster cards ranked from 1 to 12, along with two Jokers (wild) and a Mischief Night X-deck of 12 cards.&#10;&#10;Each monster card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. There are twelve 12&rsquo;s, eleven 11&rsquo;s, ten 10&rsquo;s and so on, and a single card ranked #1 which is the Pumpkin King.  The lower the number, the better the rank. While the #12s are low ranking cards and the hardest to get rid of, they each have a unique ability that may be used during the Mischief Night part of play at the beginning of each round.&#10;&#10;In addition to the standard monster cards, there is another deck of twelve special (X) cards with different backs. This deck serves two purposes; it is used before the game starts to determine the starting player order and then 2 cards are earned each round by the player who earned Pumpkin King status.  During the Mischief Round they are very useful in battling the individual special powers of the #12 cards. The more rounds you win, the better chance you have of protecting yourself from the mischief.&#10;&#10;"
