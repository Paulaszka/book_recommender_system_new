After shuffling the deck of cards, draw and reveal the first card. Each player takes a number tile matching the card and places it on the table. With each new card drawn after that, each player takes the appropriate number tile, then adds it to the tiles that they already have in play, with each player building their own arrangement of tiles.&#10;&#10;The new tile must touch at least one other tile on the same level along one side of a square. A tile can also be placed on top of two or more other tiles as long as no part of the new tile overhangs the tiles below it; new tiles placed on this same level must touch at least one other tile, while also covering parts of at least two tiles and not overhanging.&#10;&#10;Once all the cards have been drawn and the tiles placed, players take turns calculating their score. A tile on the bottom level &mdash; the 0th level, if you will &mdash; scores 0 points; a tile on the 1st level above this is worth as many points as the number on the tile; a tile on the 2nd level is worth twice the number on the tile; etc. Whoever scores the most points wins!&#10;&#10;"

But there's always a neighbour&rsquo;s lawn waiting to be mowed.&#10;Fortunately you have inherited your grandfather&rsquo;s MowMaster 2000, in it&rsquo;s day the height of grass removal technology.

Landing on vegetables or flowers, however, results in loss of points (money). Land on a pot, or go too fast into a tree or garden feature, and you'll also sustain damage to your mower.&#10;&#10;The amount you earn will be based on how much of the lawn you've successfully mowed (a minimum amount required to progress to the next garden) and how much damage you've caused.

In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Buy new cards from the common display&#10;    Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)&#10;    Train/Educate your people&#10;    Build/found cities&#10;    Take money&#10;&#10;&#10;To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.&#10;&#10;It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.&#10;&#10;Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols. Build cities to enlarge your options!&#10;&#10;The differences between the Deluxified and regular edition:&#10;&#10;Includes &quot;New Cities&quot; Expansion&#10;A foil stamped box&#10;6 oversized meeples&#10;24 normal sized meeples&#10;89 metal coins&#10;28 wood action tokens&#10;21 wood lock tokens&#10;60 wood hourglass tokens&#10;4 dual layered player boards&#10;4 custom shaped score tokens&#10;folded space custom insert&#10;1 drawstring bag&#10;1 upgraded round token&#10;&#10;"

You have some connections with national magnates who have a certain extent of influence on both sides. Your future will be bright if you have strong connections with the winning side.&#10;&#10;In the game of Tenbin ni Kakero, players secretly vote for one side or two, and when the winning side is determined, a player who has the card with the most influence on that side wins the game.&#10;&#10;At beginning of the game, players have several magnate cards and backing cards. Each magnate cards has a different number (1-20) to indicate how much influence that magnate has on which side. Backing cards are either vote card or special cards. Vote cards are numbered 0-3 to indicate vote values, and special cards have a specific power to manipulate votes in play or magnate card in one player's hand.&#10;&#10;During your turn, you may place one vote card on one side face down to add some votes, or play one special card for a special effect.&#10;&#10;When all backing cards have been played, reveal all vote cards and determine the winning side. The victory goes to the player who has the magnate card with the most influence on the winning side.&#10;&#10;Actually, the two sides are not necessarily the republicans and the monarchists.

Each card belongs to one of two sides: light side or dark side, and players' sides are determined by majority of card by side. If you have more light cards than dark cards, your side is the light. You are neutral if you have the same number of cards for both sides.&#10;&#10;Players take turns playing a card from their hand, and the card affects all appropriate players written in the text. Most cards refer to the side of players, so you should be conscious of your side. The affected players lose or gain points by the card effect.

Only the player who placed the card may look at its face value. Then they bid for the right to appraise opponents' cabbages.&#10;&#10;The appraiser (highest bidder) may reveal an opponent's card. If its value is negative, the appraiser takes that many coins from that opponent as a fine for distributing bad cabbages. If positive, the appraiser must pay the opponent that many.

Players are assigned public role cards that give them an unique ability to influence the other players. A player's loyalty is determined by the experience cards they hold in their hand. As their cards change, their loyalty may shift. The object of the game is to influence a majority of players to join your side (state or church). The church players must also have at least one player not imprisoned.&#10;&#10;Unauthorized is unique from other social deduction games in a few ways. First, the player's loyalty may change during the game. Second, the mechanisms do not require a player to lie to effectively play the game. Third, to our knowledge this is the first game about an underground church. The game does not focus on theology, but does replicate the tension of living in an underground movement under heavy persecution from an oppressive government.&#10;&#10;"

(As the rules book notes, Mr. J. P. Babcock &quot;originated the name Mah-Jongg, adapted all that was best of the Chinese forms of play, and added the Arabic numerals&quot;.) The rule book credits Douglas Lawson for having &quot;correlated&quot; the Babcock rules with card play.&#10;&#10;The 164-card deck replicates the mix of tiles in the classic game. It includes four cards for 1-9 for each of the three suits (Dots, Bamboo, Characters), as well as four each of the North, South, East and West winds and Red, Green and White Dragons, plus the 8 Flower cards. As in the classic rules, players try to collect sets or 3 or 4 of a kind or in a sequence, with bonuses for various combinations and special tiles.&#10;&#10;Instead of ivory or bone scoring sticks, the card game uses thin colored wooden rods for scoring. The game includes 40 short green sticks worth 2 each, 32 medium-length yellow sticks worth 10, 36 longer red sticks worth 100, and 8 long blue sticks worth 500.&#10;&#10;While the rule book focuses on the Standard and Royal games for four players, it does include variant rules for 3, 5 and 6 players.
