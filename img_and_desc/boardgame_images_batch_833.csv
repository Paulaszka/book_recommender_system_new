Each turn, cards are drawn and players choose to eat or not, trying to fit the pieces of meat (coming in polyomino shapes) in their stomach. For each horizontal row completely filled, that food is digested, and the player gets points depending on what kind of food (meat) the row mostly consisted of. Special stomach sizes grant bonus points. The player with the most points after a certain amount of rounds wins.&#10;&#10;The game is also playable as a solitaire endeavor, with you trying to reach the maximum number of points and beating the ghost player.&#10;&#10;"
