If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities.

Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points. Add these points to the points you've collected from buying buildings and determine the winner! Yippie kay yay a!&#10;&#10;"

Your wizards used to be powerful enough to hold your enemies at bay, but ever since the monks discovered the power contained in The Six Great Temples, everything has fallen to chaos, and none of your industrial weapons can restore peace to your lands. Your only hope for survival rests in forbidden and forgotten magic: To save your people from extinction, you must harness the power of the four elements and awaken the protector of Eden.&quot;&#10;&#10;Titans Of Eden is a fast-paced deck-building card game for 2-6 players. Each player starts with a deck of basic cards, and has to choose each turn whether they want to play powerful cards to battle their opponents, or energy-granting cards that add elemental cards to their deck for future turns.&#10;&#10;There are four main elements in Eden, and the strategies and abilities of each element are strong against one other element. This leads to fundamentally balanced gameplay: For example, if your opponent is going hard on an Ice strategy, you can use Fire cards to neutralize their cards and counter their moves. To do well in Titans Of Eden, you must build a balanced deck that can effectively respond to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;At the end of each turn, you battle your opponents. Once you destroy their three temples, you win the game. With this victory condition, you have to play to win, every turn, because you're never more than 3 turns from victory, and never more than three turns from defeat.&#10;&#10;Titans Of Eden includes a classic (Dominion-style) deck-building format for casual play, and a constructed format for competitive play.

Air &amp; Armor is a grand tactical simulation of a hypothetical Soviet attack on West Germany in the mid-1980s. It depicts the collision of the Soviet 8th Guards Army with elements of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division and the West German 12th Panzer Division in ferocious battles around the German city of Wu&#204;&#136;rzburg. This new edition is lovingly recreated with an updated order of battle, new map artwork, new unit counters, revised rules, and new scenarios.&#10;&#10;Air &amp; Armor employs a highly interactive game system with asymmetric rules modeling the different command &amp; control capabilities of each alliance. The game simulates all major aspects of modern warfare, including reconnaissance, combined arms operations, air, helicopter, and artillery strikes, chemical and electronic warfare, and combat engineering. Multiple levels of hidden intelligence produce a true &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; providing plenty of opportunities for deception, surprise, traps, and ambushes. Play this game to experience what it would have been like to command a division in battle if the Cold War had gone hot.&#10;&#10;Air &amp; Armor features twelve different scenarios, each a complete game by itself. Each scenario covers a different battlefield operation, including a meeting engagement, a delaying action, a frontal assault, an attack on a fortified line, an attack on a flank, a major river crossing operation, a NATO counterattack, an envelopment operation, and a breakout from a pocket.  Extensive Scenario, Player, and Designer Notes provide advice on play and historical detail.&#10;&#10;Air &amp; Armor is ideal for solitaire play.  The hidden intelligence system provides a high level of tension during solitaire play because, even though a solo player is commanding both sides, he never knows what he will hit when he conducts an operation.&#10;&#10;Product Information:&#10;Complexity:  High&#10;Time Scale: 1 Turn = 2 Hours&#10;Map Scale: 1 Mile/Hex&#10;Unit Scale: Companies to Regiments&#10;Players: 1-7 Players&#10;Solitaire Suitability: High&#10;Playing Time: 3 to 12 hours based on Scenario&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Your rightmost column is also considered to belong to your right-hand neighbor, and likewise your area includes the rightmost column of your left-hand neighbor. Each player reveals any two cards in their area, then the round begins.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you either draw the top card of the deck and reveal it, or draw the top card of the discard pile. If you draw from the discard pile, swap that card with any card in your area, then discard the replaced card. If you draw from the deck, you can discard that card (turning any card in your area face up) or you can swap that card with any card in your area.&#10;&#10;If you draw from the deck, any other player can knock on the table to indicate that they want this card. You can ignore the knock, or you can give them the card; in the latter case, they then replace one card in their area with this new card, taking the old card in their hand. You then take any one card in their area and swap it for a card in your area, discarding the replaced card. The other player then places the card in their hand into the hole you created when you took one of their cards.&#10;&#10;Any time you have three identical cards in a row or column &mdash; even a row that includes a card in your left neighbor's rightmost column! &mdash; you discard those cards from play.&#10;&#10;Whenever one player has all their cards face up, each other player takes one more turn, then players sum the value of the cards in their area (which includes any cards remaining their neighbor's rightmost column).
