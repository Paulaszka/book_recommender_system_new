Everyone starts with three cookie chips, rolls the number of dice equal to how many cookies they have, and follows the dice instructions. There are some minor extra rules: if you roll three smileys you get to take one back from the center/cookie jar, but that only happens 1 in 216 rolls. You also must roll all smileys to win the game, instead of just winning when you're the last one with chips/cookies. If the final cookie must go in the center/cookie jar, the game is a draw and you must start all over. Finally, there is a scorepad - you cross off one cookie for winning and an extra one if you had more than one cookie left when you won. Essentially, it is LCR with a theme.&#10;&#10;"

This consists of a 3-D office building with a spinner attached to the base.  The spinner is spun and a button in the center is pressed whenever the player wishes.  The button causes either Spider-Man or the Green Goblin to pop out of one side or the other of the building.  If Spider-Man comes out, the game is over and that player wins.  If the Green Goblin comes out, the player must make one more circuit of the board before they may try again.  Youngest player moves first, according to the rules, so perhaps there's a very slight German influence here?&#10;&#10;"
