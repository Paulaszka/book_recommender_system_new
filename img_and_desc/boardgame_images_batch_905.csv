Germany and its Slovakian ally began the invasion on September 1, 1939; the Soviet Union followed suit on the 17th.  Known in Poland as the September Campaign and in Germany by the codename Fall Weiss (Case White), the campaign ended on October 6, 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union splitting the country in two.&#10;  &#10;In White Eagle Defiant, one player controls the Germans, Slovaks and Soviets (simplified as the Germans in the game) while the other player commands the Poles.  The German objective is to gain control of Warsaw and other designated Victory cities while preventing Polish forces from destroying their forts in East Prussia and recapturing Victory cities.  If the German player does so in less time than the historical campaign, they win the game.  Anything less is a draw or a win for the Polish player.&#10;&#10;This quick-playing wargame employs very similar mechanics as Brave Little Belgium, but with a modest increase in complexity. The game uses a point-to-point map and a chit pull mechanism to simulate the campaign, with each turn representing four days. Random event chits are included to add variety and excitement to the game, reflecting the weapons (such as armored trains and aerial bombardment) used at the beginning of World War II.  The combat system, while still simple, is enhanced to better simulate mechanized warfare, as well as the use of combined forces (players can bring forces from adjacent spaces into an attack, creating primary and secondary combat groups).&#10;&#10;Other new features in White Eagle Defiant include Panzers for the Germans (which can roll two dice instead of one) and cavalry for the Poles (which can roll a &ldquo;first shot&rdquo; at the beginning of a combat round). A Victory Point track allows for variable entry of Soviet forces (depending on the success of the German player in capturing Victory cities), as well as the possibility of the Allies launching an attack in the West (if the German player fails to do well in capturing Victory cities). Finally, a &ldquo;blitzkrieg breakdown&rdquo; track is used by the German player; if the turn ends before both German army group chits are pulled, the German player may elect to activate a group, but possibly suffer a &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; while doing so &ndash; and if five such breakdowns occur, the German player automatically loses the game.&#10;&#10;Players who enjoyed Brave Little Belgium will find that White Eagle Defiant offers the same tense play for both sides, while presenting new challenges that reflect the dawn of the blitzkrieg era.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

To throw a proper monster mash, you only need one thing&mdash;Spook Juice&mdash;and you&rsquo;re gonna need an awful lot of it for these party animals. Spook Juice is a powerful spirit distilled from human fear, and the main ingredient in every popular monster drink. The bad news is that you&rsquo;re completely out of it. The good news is that the nearby town, Startleton, is a great place to scare some up.&#10;&#10;You need to send your Monster disciples to scare up some of that sweet Spook Juice. So dust off your Fearmobiles and get your scariest Monsters on Board!&#10;&#10;Monsters on Board is a dice-drafting game that takes place over six rounds. Each round, players will draft Monster Lords (dice) arriving from out of town in Fearmobiles, trying to fulfill their Prophecy cards.&#10;&#10;After each player drafts four Monsters, they will send them to the Order of Spider Jack. Monsters sent here will give players actions, as well as Spook Juice when Spider Jack is summoned. The higher the die&rsquo;s number, the scarier the Monster, which means the more Spook Juice they will scare up for you. However, scarier Monsters have fewer and less powerful actions, while less frightening Monsters have more powerful actions (they try harder)&mdash; so choose wisely!&#10;&#10;Drafted Monsters also move their matching colored Grunt (Monster miniature) through the Town of Startleton, scaring the townspeople with the help of their little Minions (miniatures). In doing so, Grunts will award players bonus actions. If the Grunts terrorize the town well enough, they will grant bonus Spook Juice during final scoring.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players will draft Arch Monsters and Ghosts that will help them achieve their goals.&#10;&#10;During final scoring, players will gain additional Spook Juice based on how well they completed their Prophecy cards, scared the Town, and appeased the Arch Monsters. The player with the most Spook Juice wins!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Sounds straightforward, right?

They're joined by a lot of different challenges, refreshed constantly as the game progresses, that are the either the kinds of things you don't really want to do in polite company, or the kinds of things you've been waiting for an excuse to do in polite company.

But if you don't, you're probably going to lose.)&#10;&#10;What emerges is the lovingly-designed equivalent of that one party you went to in your youth that everyone still talks about, for all the right reasons, twenty years later. What's more, the amount of time it takes to set up, learn and play is far shorter than the intense period of soul-searching you'll get when you sit bolt upright in bed in 3am, drenched in cold sweat, having remembered that you won by texting the word &quot;MILF&quot; to your boss.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

293530,,"CasTiles and Armies is meant to be a fast-paced tile-based Castle and Siege strategy game for 2 players. Players will build a castle wall, reinforce it as needed, and attempt to defeat the enemy Monarch with their troops.&#10;&#10;CasTiles and Armies consists of 2 phases. The Construction Phase and the Combat Phase.&#10;&#10;The Construction Phase:&#10;Starting with Player #1, the players will take turns placing castle tiles (dark grey) to construct their Castle Wall until it is 5-tiles wide. After placing a tile, the player may choose to discard one tile, placing it in a Rubble Heap, and then draw back up to 5 tiles in their hand. The Rubble Heap is a separate mass of tiles which can no longer be brought back into the game.&#10;&#10;After the 5th tile is placed, 2 more tiles (a total of 6 additional tiles after the Gatehouse) may be placed in the Army Reserves Zone and/or the Offensive Line Zone. Be considerate of the numbers on the tiles during placement, the numbers all mean something! Once the castle is fully constructed, the final step in this phase is to calculate the strength of the wall. The Gatehouse icons count as wild cards and will conform to the number placed adjacent. We recommend placing dice at each of the 4 wall junctions with values that represent their strength. Dice make it easier to track damage on the castle wall. You will likely need a range of dice from D4s to D20s.&#10;&#10;Tile placement is a key consideration! Your strategy during this phase of the game will determine your success as a defender or conquer. Tiles must be placed so they read left to right or top-facing-right (from the player&rsquo;s perspective). See the possible scenarios below to determine how to calculate the strength. The higher the number, the stronger the wall. Once a tile is down it is down.&#10;&#10;The Combat Phase:&#10;With the castle wall now complete and total strength calculated and marked on the playing field, it is now time to start combat!&#10;&#10;Each player should still have 5 tiles in their hand. At this time, ALL army tiles (gold-ish) in their hand can be placed in either the Army Reserves Zone or Offensive Line Zone, starting with Player #1. Hopefully, you didn&rsquo;t discard them all during the last phase. Then discard or draw tiles as needed to keep only 3 tiles in your hand. Like the wall junctions, place a die on the arrow side of the army tile to indicate the strength of the army.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

Seeking to build robust teams for future missions &mdash; and more importantly, to land lucrative government contracts &mdash; they have created special training islands. On these islands, they are able to simulate all of the deadly conditions their soldiers may face on remote planets.&#10;&#10;To fund these expensive programs and the military-grade innovations built into their test subjects, the arms manufacturers have teamed up with media moguls to create and promote broadcast competitions live from the islands' training grounds. Thus was born &quot;RELOAD&quot;, the biggest TV show on the planet, with the most charismatic and capable subjects competing in front of millions of avid viewers to win fame for themselves and fortunes for their creators.&#10;&#10;In Reload, you get to engage in this battle-royale experience thanks to an innovative action dice system that offers fast-paced play and the freedom to explore the island while fighting for fame.&#10;&#10;"
