The challenge is that each gardener can only afford the space to plant one type of flower.  Of course, a gardener could just take what he needs from his neighbors' flowers.  Naturally, that means that he must jealously guard his own fields, as well.  Each gardener has an animal, and the two of them defend their garden's fields from unwelcome harvests.&#10;&#10;Each player has nine field tiles, each three parcels by three parcels in size.  Each parcel can be cultivated with its matching flower, or simply plowed instead.  Players harvest flowers by covering them on theirs or others parcels with their own field tiles, which are placed partially overlapping the existing field tiles.&#10;&#10;A winner of the 2006 Concours International de Cr&#195;&#169;ateurs de Jeux de Soci&#195;&#169;t&#195;&#169; (as La Bonne Soupe).&#10;&#10;"

In the Indian epic - the Ramayana, Dasharatha, Rama's father is forced by an old promise to send Rama, his eldest son away to the forest for fourteen years. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. Vanavaas - the Adventures in the Forest follows their experiences until the kidnapping of Sita. In the second game, the Search for Sita, you follow the adventures of Rama and Lakshmana as they search for Sita and seek the help of the vanaras or monkeys. Hanuman finally finds Sita in Lanka where she is a prisoner of the demon king - Ravana. Rama and Lakshmana, along with their new friends Sugriva and Hanuman decide that the only option is to fight a war with Ravana and rescue Sita. It was a mighty battle fought between the rakshasas led by Ravana and the vanara army led by Rama. This game brings you face to face with some of the unforgettable characters like Kumbakarna, Indrajit and Jambavan. It also introduces you to many of the special powers that gave both sides the numerous advantages. Rama is invincible and represents the Power of Good. However, in the epic he is told to seek the assistance of the vanaras led by Sugriva. It is this that led to the concept of the game. The game is based on C. Rajagopalachari's Ramayana in English.

His characteristics and qualities coupled with circumstances will dictate what a force can and cannot do. The closer you are to supplies, the more you can do- unfortunately you can&rsquo;t win by sitting in a supply depot.&#10;A turn is played in operations. Players alternate operating with a force and Leader of their choosing, trying to outmaneuver their opponents and lever them out of commanding positions, opening up strategic objectives. Beware; although you may be only a mile or so from your objective, stretched supply lines, bands of guerrilla fighters and incompetent Generals can force a sudden retreat, undoing careful planning.&#10;&#10;The board is divided into supply areas (color coded) that can change due to territorial acquisitions. While the British begin with excellent supplies near Lake Ontario, the loss of Fort George can mean restricted movement in your own heartland. If the Americans lose Fort Schlosser, the British will have a free hand marching to Black Rock or Buffalo, causing the Americans to retire in shame from the Canadian side.&#10;&#10;Battles, Skirmishes, and guerrilla activity not only leads to the loss of men, but of confidence, and an army that loses hope will degenerate into an armed mob, incapable of organized action. Both sides were determined during this campaign, so battles tended to be hard fought, and cause high casualties, even among the Generals.&#10;&#10;The Scale&#10;&#10;The Niagara region in not a huge one. An army could march from the top to the bottom in two days (in peacetime).We use two day turns, which allows for the tiniest of actions and moves to be of significance. As far as troop scale is concerned all units used in play are called Detachments, which represent between 100-200 men. Thus the British 100th&#10;regiment (roughly 600 men) is composed of four detachments.&#10;&#10;"

Despite the climate of hope in the division of defeated Germany, a series of suspicions begin to emerge among the old allies. The Russians with control of so-called Eastern Europe awoke among Western allies suspected of a possible breakthrough in 1946.&#10;&#10;The Americans along with the British began to reposition the bulk of their troops on German frontiers and began a program to ship supplies and ammunition to their units. In 1947 the Russians also began to move in this chess, with the increase of their military personnel in occupied Germany. In 1948 the first course occurs when Stalin&rsquo;s armies block Berlin, barring access to supplies and new troops.&#10;&#10;The American response comes in two nuclear attacks, one on Moscow with a new American bomb called BlueToddler and another attack on the Soviet heavy industries in the Urals with 3 small tactical bombs known as Nuke Candy. The Russians advance their conventional forces on the allies and a new conflict begins. The allies are now mortal enemies, on the one hand, the Americans, the English, and the French, and on the other hand the Russians and the Chinese, who proclaim themselves communists in 1947, joining the so-called Soviet Federation.&#10;&#10;In 1949 is invented by the Russians the engines of macro combustion enabling the introduction of so-called combat mechs. These armaments recover the ground lost by the Soviets, pushing the allies to the borders of Poland. In 1950 the first Russian nuclear bomb explodes over New York, taking the world war to the American soil! In 1951 the Allies entered with their mechs of combat in Europe, bringing the conflict to unimaginable levels.&#10;In this scenario, a powerful organization arises, formed by old Nazis who dream of having a great Germany again: the Werwolf Korps. Hidden in the Bavarian Alps in deep Nazi fortresses, they emerge as a fighting force with fantastic weapons and black magic. These represent one more weight in the pendulum of history.&#10;&#10;Luftwaffe 46 is a jet fighter game set in the world of Hotwar, where the war doesn&rsquo;t end in 1945 but continues as Germany launches its other jet plane projects and fights the allies in dogfights.

Each player assumes the role of Simon (Peter) in travelling through the Holy Land in search of three Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven.&#10; By rolling a 6-sided die, the players move through land, mountain, and water routes. Each city on the map has a face-down counter; these counters represent events and items, including the Keys. When a player lands on a city, they must roll the die to determine whether they must a) turn the counter immediately, b) answer a trivia question, or c) perform a task. The biblical trivia questions are multi-choice (3) and on a correct answer the counter can be turned. The tasks are pantomimes such as &quot;sewing&quot;, &quot;smoke getting into eyes&quot; etc. If another player guesses the task correctly, the counter can be turned, and the guesser also gets an extra roll on her turn.&#10;&#10;A negative result in the trivia or task finishes the player's turn, but she can remain in the space and try again on the next turn.&#10;&#10;If a player lands on a violet space, an event takes place; these are also included in the trivia cards.&#10;&#10;The first player to collect three Keys and proceed to the finish (&quot;ship bound for Rome&quot;) wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

I have done my best to compile the most important of my time. ... I, Harikrishna, son of Venkatram was born in Aurangabad in south Maharashtra. I have described in this book many wonderful games and the ways to play them.&#10;&#10;It was about the same time that Krishnaraja Wodeyar of Mysore developed and promoted many interesting games.&#10;&#10;The game we have here is a simple strategy game described by Harikrishna as a game in 24 squares.
