Monocle, sketchbook, or even stuffed toys of the creatures! (But they aren't creatures, they are only stuffed toys of creatures.)&#10;&#10;One deck plays up to 3 players. Combine decks to play with more (2 decks for up to 6, 3 decks for up to 9)&#10;&#10;There are 2 versions of AGAQGCTATDACYRadishes (coloured in, and line art) for easy mixing and separation.&#10;&#10;"

Play a card so one of the first letters or its state or capital name matches one of the first letters of the top table card; or just play a card onto the top of the table pile.

Play one or more cards so that one large initial of each of them adds to a growing word on the table, or just play one card to start a new word. If you complete a valid word you keep its cards and score their blue numbers. Valid words are those about anything about America: a state or city name, famous person, work of art, invention, etc.&#10;&#10;For each of these games, you refill your hand after play, and the target score for a win is 1776.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

Like all tarock, Esculenta is distinguished by a super-long trump suit with the other cards being where one score most of the points: in this case half the deck, 20 cards, are trump! Players bid to win the most card points but often gain even more points from declaring to achieve certain bonus feats in tricks, such as taking the last trick with the lowest trump. &#10;In addition to the fact it&rsquo;s played with a regular deck, distinctions include declarer going against a defender who plays two cards to the three card trick with the help of a mini-dummy, and an idiosyncratic trick-playing order. The dummy is played by defender (so it's 2:1) but this is offset by the fact the declarer can often maintain the lead by forcing dummy to win.&#10;&#10;Esculenta is part of the &quot;Twisted Dummy&quot; series: 2 player adaptations of traditional games using dummy third hand used in innovative ways.&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

To win the trophy, a team must win 2 games.&#10;&#10;Players shuffle the Action cards and the Referee cards to create two decks of face down cards.&#10;&#10;The Ball marker will move from player to player during the game, depending on how the game goes. The Action card is always revealed by the player who is in possession of the ball.&#10;The player with the ball reveals the first card from the Action card pile and considers its effect.&#10;&#10;After the Action card or the Referee card has been drawn, each player's active player cards are discarded into the discard pile.&#10;A player takes a shot at the goal when a Shot Action card is revealed or it results from the contents of other Action cards. &#10;If a Referee card is drawn players consider a card from the Referee card pile e.g. penalty kick, free kick, injury.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)&#10;&#10;Afryka&#197;&#132;skie zwierz&#196;&#153;ta gromadz&#196;&#133; si&#196;&#153; na sawannie, aby zobaczy&#196;&#135; fina&#197;&#130; Ligi Dzikich Zwierz&#196;&#133;t.

While each die has a primitive shape, when combined they form a fun, innovative and flexible game play system.  Players can cast two dice which allows them to move their player token(s) in a variety of ways.&#10;&#10;In order to expand the usage of this new dice form I invented a short, repeatable and fun game. The game I created is a 1x5 spaces game called &quot;Yoncollon Duel&quot;.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to be first to move your three pieces from your side to the opposite side.&#10;&#10;Players : 2&#10;Board : 1x5 board&#10;Pieces : Players have 3 pieces each.&#10;Bet chips : Players have 5 discs each.&#10;Dice : a pair of  classic speed dice and modern speed dice. Players decide which dice edition to use before the game. &#10;Game goal : Be the first player to move your three pieces from your side to the opposite side.&#10;Decide first player and then alternate turns.  Players cast two dice then move their piece(s) by the moving rule below at their turn.&#10;&#10;A: Move one piece with sum of dice pip(s).&#10;B : Move two pieces according to each die pip(s). Players can decide their first move pip(s).&#10;Pieces must land on open spaces jumping other pieces on the board and must reach the opposite side exactly. If player has no legal place to move at his turn,  then he loses the game. If players have only one piece, moving a piece by either one of dice pips is considered a legal move.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

You first hide your loot in any area of town on the 4 pointed star spots on the board. Place you team on the starts spots and begin play. Be the first to return all you opponent&rsquo;s gemstones to your base. Your team is one Officer and two Bandits. Work them together to take your opponent's gemstones before they can take all of yours. Guard your part of town while your Bandits loot other parts. If your bandits get caught and get locked up, use your Officer to let them free. The Officer is the only one who have the keys to the jails on your corner of town.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
