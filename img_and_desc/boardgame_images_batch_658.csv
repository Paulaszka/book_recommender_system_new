Players battle over a series of rounds by flicking their units until one player claims the entire board.

The constant action will create chaotic battles making each round feel like an entirely new game.&#10; The player using the blue pieces starts the game by choosing one of their pieces and flicking it. Once the piece is flicked, resolve any special abilities if applicable. The red player then takes their first turn by doing the same. Play alternates like this until the round is over; with the goal being to knock all of the opponent&rsquo;s pieces off the game board entirely. If any part of a piece is still on the game board, it is still in play.&#10;&#10;A round is won when only one color remains on the board. With each round won, the winner claims a new row allowing them to place a piece or pieces in that row in the next round.

Whether you&rsquo;re trying to get a unit of warriors to move, seeing how effective it&rsquo;s shooting or fighting is, or how well it has defended itself, you&rsquo;ll be using the same dice pool mechanism.  You determine the number of dice to roll and each result of 4+ is a success.  The more successes you roll, the better your units will do, and the more likely you are to win.  Simple!&#10;&#10;Of course fighting a good tactical battle, getting your units into advantageous situations, and making effective command decisions will mean you&rsquo;ll be far more likely to win.  Coming up with effective tactics for your chosen army to defeat your opponents is what will take you time to master.&#10;&#10;So with Warband&rsquo;s intuitive rules you&rsquo;ll be fighting the battle not the rulebook, and hopefully having a lot of fun into the bargain!&#10;&#10;You'll be able to decide which of the fantastic races you'd like to command and then construct your force from the lists provided.  &#10;Warband includes complete army lists for twelve armies, with abilities, options, spell lists, and descriptions including; &#10;Barbarian men, Dark elves, Dragon men, Eldritch vampires, Goblins, High elves, Hill dwarves, Lizardmen, Samurai apes, Taurians, Undead, and Wood elves.  Each army is balanced by being constructed from a fixed 500 point cost.  Powerful units cost more so are rarer.  A typical warband will have 10-12 units, representing an army of maybe 3000 warriors.&#10;&#10;Army composition and optional upgrades are highly flexible, allowing you to build the force that best fits your style of play.  If you'd like to command a horde of bison riding barbarians, rampaging minotaurs, skirmishing ghouls, or serried ranks of deadly elven archers then you'll find something to suit you in the Warband rules.  This flexibility means that you should be able to play with your favourite fantasy race in a way that suits your personal style and preferences, while your force still retains a unique and interesting character.&#10;&#10;"
