Then came the line of emperors: Julius, Augustus, Tiberius, Calligula, Claudius, and then the sixth evil Emperor Nero. After the beast Nero committed suicide in AD 68 after an attempt to prove he was God incarnate, it appeared the Roman Empire had received a fatal wound to its head  (leadership) which could not be healed. Three Caesars: The Roman Civil War of AD 69 re-creates this struggle. Galba, Ortho, and Vitellius engaged in a war where Romans fought against their fellow Romans to see who would become the next emperor of Rome. &#10;Historically, none of them succeeded, either militarily or politically. Can you succeed where they failed? If not, General Vespasian is on his way to Rome to proclaim himself emperor, and begin the Flavian Dynasty.&#10;&#10;III Caesars is a card driven game wherein the first player to get to Rome, conquer it, and acquire 10 political points wins immedaitely.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

As the game progresses, you will roll dice to see how values grow and fall. To make the best of this, you can build high value rooms, destroy negatively valued rooms, cap towers to score them early, and gain rerolls to adjust the outcomes of the market.&#10;&#10;All you need to play is the PDF, three standard dice and a pencil.&#10;&#10;&#10;Released in the January 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.&#10;&#10;"

Fires burn in their heads, keeping their engines running and they survive a hail of bullets. Princess Feodora has taken control of London, which has now been turned into Clockwork City.&#10;&#10;Machines were given more and more autonomy and control - punchcards passed between soldiers and seers. Now, the machines seem to have developed some sort of consciousness and no-one has heard from Feodora in years.&#10;&#10;In Edinburgh, re-engineering has gone awry and a new set of machines has arisen, wanting nothing less than the decimation of every potential problem in the land - including humans!&#10;&#10;Clockwork City is being invaded, this is the moment for the human captives of Clockwork City to escape.&#10;&#10;Welded Iron allows players to either play as the Imperial machines defending their tyranny over Clockwork City, or as human heroes who strive to escape.&#10;&#10;The Imperials want to keep the humans as slaves and keep their infrastructure intact. The humans want to avoid casualties and use the chaos to evacuate the city. In the end, everyone might survive but this is just the start of the war.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Welded Iron is a tower defense yet competitive game of an uneasy asymmetric alliance between one player: the imperial machine overlords and the other human factions. The imperial machines will use iron and steel resources to build and maintain infrastructure, while also ensuring area control over regions where humans work and live. Each player will have asymmetric powers to reflect the differences in strengths and objectives. For instance, The imperials will have powers which help to quickly build up defense infrastructure from the invading machines of the North, while also utilizing passive human &quot;resources&quot; to help in those goals. The human factions will have formed an alliance with one another after the grueling human wars in a bid to overthrow their imperial overlords. Their objectives are at odds with the imperials, as they must extract and rescue as many humans in clockwork city, and beyond to win, yet also defending the city from invasion.&#10;&#10;The game utilities randomly allocated hex tiles with positions in which towers are built for defense and attack, with regions to place electricity to power these up. The hex tiles also contain unknown bonus resources, with higher more valuable resources closer to the invading camps of the north. The imperial and human factions must work together to defeat an AI controlled invasion force or face annihilation, while also working towards their own objectives to win.&#10;&#10;Designed by acclaimed medium-heavy weight designer David Turczi, Welded Iron will please those looking for a new fresh take on tower defense games, with many miniatures available.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

In this game, you are a Map Maker, exploring the depths of the area&rsquo;s most dangerous dungeons in the pursuit of documenting every creature and dungeon boss you meet, and hopefully defeat, along the way. Then, when you are safe and sound back at your humble abode, you will fill in the details on the included Wild Map for future adventurers to reference. Be careful out there! This is not an easy task.&#10;&#10;Map Maker is divided into two phases; dungeon delving and boss fighting. In the dungeon delving phase, you will choose and resolve a variety of Encounters according to your Hero's stats for each level you descend, as you venture deeper into the dungeons, until you meet the boss. During the boss fighting phase, you will fight the dungeon boss following special instructions on each boss sheet. Each boss has unique features, skills and actions that you have to use different strategies to overcome, if you want to prevail.&#10;&#10;Object of the game:&#10;Map Maker is for you and up to three of your friends to become the Heroes of the story, and to delve deep into a dungeon until you discover the final boss. You win the game if you defeat the boss. Then you get to fill out the Wild Map and record the various information about the dungeon; how many levels there were and who/what the final boss was. Each map marks six dungeons with Roman numerals. Once you have defeated all six dungeons and recorded all the details on the Wild Map, your quest is complete. And remember, the brave Hero who delivers the final blow to the dungeon boss gets to put their name on the Wild Map to be remembered for all eternity.

Eight scenarios introduce players to U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia including a scenario after the US withdrew from Vietnam, a full campaign scenario as well as high solitaire capability. Players appreciate the ability to start in any year of the war they wish and fight to the end of any other year of the war. The game provides a comprehensive historical approach using mechanics that include guerrilla warfare, faction differentiation, political turmoil, and veteran advantages. This design has already been used as a successful teaching tool.&#10;&#10;This is a card-driven, area-based design with low counter density and a much simplified combat system. Each scenario represents a year and players have the flexibility of starting in any year of the war and ending in any later year of the war. Players choose either the Allies (US, ARVN, Cambodian and Laotian) or Communist (NVA, VC, Cambodian and Laotian) Players engage in guerrilla warfare &ndash; VC units remain hidden until engaged. VC units may be simple units or reinforced units or simply false information. When determined to be false information, players roll on the Bush Events Table which involve events from discovering Chinese troops to the arrival of USO shows featuring John Wayne and Bob Hope.&#10;&#10;This edition involves the use of three card decks, A red deck (communist), a blue deck (Allied) and a black deck (interchangeable). Prior to every game, half of the black deck is shuffled into each of the red and blue decks ensuring a different game every time. Cards indicate the amount of RPs (Resource Points) that may be spent or banked, a historic situation, and its game effects. Certain cards are year specific. Within each Red and Blue Deck are a number of Campaign cards that may be chosen by each player allowing increased abilities but only in a predetermined area.&#10;&#10;The game does not ignore political ramifications. Card events cover mass protests in the U.S. and more significantly the instability of the South Vietnamese government. The Allied player controls more firepower but must walk a tightrope between U.S. and ARVN (South Vietnamese) casualties. Too many U.S. casualties leads to a rapid rise in Communist morale.  Too many ARVN casualties will result in a coup which has major strategic advantages for the Communist Player. While in Cambodia and Laos, the destruction of all government forces means the fall of those governments. Throughout the game both sides jockey for the &ldquo;Hearts and Minds&rdquo; in each province. Political Control determines the availability and expansion of VC influence.&#10;&#10;Hearts and Minds, Third Edition offers players an easier to follow rulebook with simpler victory conditions. Also included: tested solitaire rules and a separate solitaire player aide; a premium mounted map that includes all of the charts necessary to play the game; full-sized poker quality card deck; standard playing dice and a new artistic approach to factional units.&#10;&#10;Product Information&#10;&#10;Complexity: Low to Medium (4 out of 10)&#10;Solitaire suitability: Medium to high  (7 out of 10)&#10;Time Scale: Each scenario represents one year. The campaign game covers 8-10 years.&#10;Map Scale: The Map is divided into provincial areas, indicating major cities and US major bases&#10;Unit Scale:  Units are abstract and represent US, ARVN, NVA, VC, Cambodian and Laotian&#10;Players: Two Player game (Solitaire friendly)&#10;Playing Time:  45 minutes or less per scenario&#10;Designer: John Poniske  &#10;Original Developer: Stan Hilinski&#10;Solitaire Developer: David Wessman&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;24 page rule/scenario book&#10;Solitaire Player Aid&#10;Three Counter sheets (3/4&rdquo; Counters)&#10;22&rdquo; x 33&rdquo; Mounted Map&#10;80 Standard Playing Cards (27 Red/27 Blue/ 28 black)&#10;Two 6-sided dice (1 Red/1Blue)&#10;One box and lid set&#10;&#10;-from the publisher's website&#10;&#10;"

To do so, you must position your wizards so that they are on a tile showing a Crystal of Power at the start of your turn.&#10;&#10;Each turn is comprised of 4 phases: Gather, Magic, Discovery and Draw. In the Magic Phase, you are given 4 units of Magic Power which you can use to move your wizards and attack others. Certain magic tiles can increase or reduce this total.&#10;&#10;During the game, wizards flip a multitude of magic tiles to discover curses, potions, spells, Crystals of Power and other surprises. During the Draw Phase, you get a spell card, which can help you with your quest.&#10;&#10;Do you have what it takes to be the most powerful wizard in the Crystal Hall?&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

You can play 3 to 8 players (ages 16 and up), starting off with a decision of whether to get to work or go get educated (sound familiar?).  But from there this game diverges from humdrum life, as you move your token along the board you can get to do and experience things that maybe you only wish you could do, or in some cases - wish that you could avoid!&#10;&#10;How the game plays:  &#10;Once everyone has their starting money and figured out who goes first, each player will decide whether you want to obtain an Occupation that requires a degree or one that does not.  Both sets are unique.  You will start your turn by drawing a Redefine card.  Then you will use your Occupation Special ability (if applicable) if you want. The Occupation abilities are funny and unique to each job.  You'll roll the die to see how many spaces to move your token on the game board.  (Yes, this game does feature that old-school notion of rolling dice for movement.)   &#10;Then you and other players can start using Redefine cards on yourself or on each other.  These &quot;wild cards&quot; can have a fun and unexpected effect on the game - either helping yourself, helping others, hindering others, or downright messing with the other players in funny ways.  You will move your token forward on the game board, following the instructions on the space you land on.  Usually this means you draw a card from a specific deck and follow its instructions.  Then there can be another round where you and other players can use Redefine cards again.  &#10;And that&rsquo;s about it &ndash; this is where your turn will normally end, and on it goes until you reach the Get Done space, cash out, and wait to see who has the most money (cash, properties, other assets).  If you have kids, you can cash them in for money at the end - because children can have value!&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most money at the end, wins!&#10;&#10;The typical game of 5-6 players will take about 2 hours to complete.  But it will be a very hilarious two hours!  This game is a kick to play, fun for most age groups, and will definitely satisfy the need to experience life the way you always wished it could be!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Smith. This game utilizes a unique and fast-paced, card-driven combat/build system revolving around carrier operations which will provide players with a multitude of decisions. While extremely competitive as a two-player game, Pacific Tide can be enjoyed again and again in Solitaire play format with its unique, &ldquo;personality&rdquo; driven bot system.&#10;&#10;Despite the Strategic level of the game, there are operational and even tactical nuances, as players must decide when and how to commit their carrier forces, land-based air, and even their intelligence assets. To a degree, the Japanese player is racing against the clock. The quality of his pilots degrades over time, and starting in 1943, he also loses the strategic initiative as he becomes the second player. The US Player is also fighting the clock, as he cannot sit back and take a relaxed approach to defeating Japan. If he doesn't win by 1945, he doesn't win at all. Tension build as both sides race toward decisive carrier battles and seizure of key geographical objectives.&#10;&#10;The card-based combat/build system is a different take on the &quot;normal&quot; event/operations points driven systems. Separate card decks are provided for the U.S. and Japanese player. Each year, the players receive that year's cards for free&hellip;but must use build points to repurchase older cards. This will cause the player a few agonizing moments, as he typically cannot afford to re-buy every card he needs (or thinks he needs). Players must also decide which aspect of cards to use &ndash; many have multiple but exclusive uses (such as, &quot;Do A or do B&quot;) and these uses sometimes give very different results based on operational or strategic needs at the time. To help ensure a tense and dynamic game, the system forces players to make many choices and decisions throughout play.&#10;&#10;Units comprise five different types:&#10;&#10;&bull; CV units represent individual carriers or small groups of escort carriers&#10;&bull; INF units represent all types of ground combat troops, including Marine and Army units&#10;&bull; Naval Air units represent carrier borne aircraft&#10;&bull; Land Air units represent bombers and fighters based on land&#10;&bull; Partisan units represent the Filipino resistance, which grew to considerable size by the end of the war&#10;&bull; Campaign set up and reinforcement codes are printed on the counter&#10;&bull; Enhanced ergonomics are built into the set up and reinforcement charts&#10;Control and Entrench markers are also provided for play.&#10;&#10;Special rules are provided for amphibious attacks, repair of fleets, supply effects, and guerillas. Bidding rules determine which side one will play in a tournament-style play format.&#10;&#10;As a bonus for solo players, Pacific Tide features a solitaire assistant &ndash; commonly known as a &quot;Bot&quot; &ndash; which gives guidance to the player for either side during solitaire play. The assistant acts differently based on the &quot;personality&quot; it's been given...aggressive, defensive, or balanced. All game cards have a rating which the assistants will prioritize differently for play.

Deep beneath the crust, the oceans are teeming with alien sea life. Shellfish, plants, corals, arthropods, even strange fish and larger sea creatures populate a wide-ranging interconnected web of hidden seas. Volcanism is rampant, warming the mineral-rich waters and creating excellent conditions for energy-harvesting.&#10;&#10;The largest cavern close to the surface is known as The Pocket. This is where the initial teams of Stabilizers built their first outposts, with the intent to establish long-term communities capable of surviving indefinitely. Aqua-farming is well established; food and other sundries are efficiently gathered. The Pocket has many deposits of minerals and crystals that can be mined and processed to create strong and versatile construction materials locally.&#10;&#10;Colonists arrive at the Doorstep at regular intervals when the Threshold is opened. The arrivals are of four general types: Pioneers (who are tasked with exploring the changing surface of the moon and the labyrinth of seas beneath), Engineers (who develop and operate the machinery and structures needed to run the colonies), Marines (who defend the colonies from hostile sea life, unwanted intruders, and other colonies), and Stewards (overseers responsible for strategy and negotiation).&#10;&#10;Colony development mostly occurs beneath the ice; this is where all of the moon&rsquo;s resources are concentrated, so this is where the effort is best spent. To keep close to the surface, most colony structures are built clinging onto the underside of the ice crust. Surface structures will be built only once an undersea outpost is well established and beginning to thrive. In addition to construction and resource-gathering, colonies spend a lot of effort on exploring this new environment. The volcanic action and mineral-heavy waters make long-range scanning unreliable, so physical exploration is required to plumb the depths.&#10;&#10;As the Pocket is explored and expanded, the established colonies have been making some unusual discoveries beneath the ice. Deep in the trenches, artifacts of non-human origin are starting to be found. The dark seas hide many secrets. Squads of mercenaries occasionally appear on the surface and beneath the sea, penetrating the Threshold somehow to carry out an unknown mission on the moon. These aspects are worrisome but can&rsquo;t distract the colonies from their main goals.&#10;&#10;It is still early in the Artemis project. A foothold on life here has been gained, but it will take tenacious effort from the competing colonies to reach the point where Europa is truly viable as a home.&#10;&#10;The Artemis Project is a dice (dis)placement and engine building game that has you fighting the planet as well as the other players.

You play a young pilot of bots who faces his opponents for glory in a LAB in the rich universe of Eden. You will have to control your bots, make them fight, move and hack the enemy bots in order to emerge victorious from the fight.&#10;&#10;The game is played out as a succession of rounds during which the active player can play &quot;routines&quot; cards and / or activate his driver.&#10;&#10;The &quot;routines&quot; cards are one of the original points of the game. They represent both the possibilities of actions of your bots and the defense programs of your pilot. If you want to activate your bots it will be necessary to play a card and to realize the action described on this one. If your pilot takes damage, you will need to discard a card.&#10;&#10;The different bots you have under your control have special abilities. It's up to you to use them wisely to dominate your opponents in the arena.&#10;&#10;The RoninBot has advanced combat software, Jujitsu 2.0, which allows it to attack multiple opponents at once.&#10;&#10;The PushBot can move other Bots thanks to its Tesla pistons, but their programming prevents them from pushing a Pilot.&#10;&#10;The SipderBot is equipped with an electromagnetic web allowing it to hack remotely.&#10;&#10;The combat and hacking actions are resolved by a die roll. &#10;A bot that suffers a success to a combat roll is destroyed and removed from the arena. A pilot who suffers a success to a combat roll must discard a &quot;routine&quot; card.&#10;&#10;A bot or terminal changes sides when hacked. The successful hacker places a possession marker of his color on the base of the hacked bot or terminal.&#10;&#10;At the end of his turn, the active player draws 2 &quot;routine&quot; cards. When a player finishes his deck of &quot;routine&quot; cards the game ends.&#10;&#10;In order to determine the winner, players score points in the game and at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Each terminal under your possession at the beginning of your turn grants you a victory point.

If the goalie rolls a 1 or 2 the ball is lost to a corner and the attacking player gets a chance to strike again. If the goalie rolls a 3 or 4 the goal is scored and the game restarts from the centre. A save is made the goalie throws a 5 or 6 and the game restarts from the Goalie Dot.&#10;&#10;The player who scored the most goals in 15 minutes is the winner.

During set-up, you pair your nation with one of a suite of ideologies. You might choose, for example, to enact real history by playing the German Reich under fascism &mdash; or you could return the Kaiser to power and play the German Reich under monarchism. Each ideology has access to different focus decks, which will affect your resources and your routes to victory; these cards are played turn to turn and can influence everything from scoring victory points, to making lucrative trade agreements or declarations of war.&#10;&#10;Each board game nation has its own player boards, ideologies, cards, tokens, and minis. Each player's tracker board shows their current supply levels of vital resources, such as political power, stability, production, and manpower.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, you receive resources based on how many territories you control with resource icons and factories. (You also gain resources during the game for trade agreements and engine cards that grant bonus resources.) You must pay to upkeep your stability, or pay even more to improve it. High stability grants bonuses to your nation, but with a high cost &mdash; although possibly not higher than letting your stability plummet.&#10;&#10;You have a political board that shows all playable and non-playable nations, and you use it to manage who you're allied with, who you're at war with, and everything in between. During the political phase, you can spend political power to adjust your alliances and conflicts; for each point you spend, you move one of your flag tokens, changing your political stance with one other nation. Changing your stance aggressively will eventually lead to a state of war, whereas changing your stance peacefully will lead to forming an alliance &mdash; and the more your ideologies match, the less political power you need.&#10;&#10;While at war with another nation, when your units move into their territory, you'll start combat. If you win, you'll conquer and take control of that territory, which is the fastest way to gain more resources. While in an alliance with another nation, you can move your units through their territory without starting a fight. You can also deploy units in your allies' territory! By forming an alliance, you can send units across the board to invade a distant nation.&#10;&#10;The game lasts six rounds, covering 1939-1944, and you need the most points to win.&#10;&#10;"
