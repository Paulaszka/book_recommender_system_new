Using tried and true mechanics but with some major twists, Tide at Sunrise will be a major test of player skill that is rarely seen in the wargaming hobby. Here, the base system is little more than the tried and true game from SPI called Napoleon at Waterloo. But not all is at it seems.&#10;&#10;Here is the sequence of play:&#10;&#10;Japanese Player Turn&#10;&#10;* Naval Phase&#10;    * Transport Allocation&#10;    * Movement Phase&#10;    * Combat Phase&#10;    * Replacement and Recovery&#10;&#10;Russian Player Turn&#10;&#10;* Colonel Akashi Secret Operations Phase&#10;    * Transport Allocation Phase&#10;    * Movement Phase&#10;    * Combat Phase&#10;    * Supply and Recovery Phase&#10;&#10;After the completion of both Player Turns, victory points are determined and, if the Japanese have not won a sudden death win, play continues to the next turn.&#10;&#10;The game focuses on two aspects of the actual event. Players have to manage their armies using an abstract logistical system called &ldquo;Transport Points&rdquo; in the game. The Japanese Transport Points are an abstraction of the merchant marine force that the Japanese had available in 1904 and 1905. This can be disrupted from Russian naval activity. The Russian Transport Points are an abstraction of the rail capacity of the newly built Trans-Siberian Railroad. Weather can affect this total if there are heavy snows in Siberia. Colonel Akashi can also stir up trouble and reduce the available Russian Transport totals with sudden strikes and riots in the Russian heartland. Both players use these points to bring on new forces and to replace battlefield losses. Finding the right balance of the two uses is key to being successful in the game.&#10;&#10;Secondly, players must find the delicate balance between defending and attacking on two separate fronts. How much defends and attacks towards the all-important port of Port Arthur and how much attacks or holds the tough mountain passes of Manchuria - the key to the open plains to the north &ndash; where terrain is less defensible and victory points are everywhere.&#10;&#10;Victory in the game is determined by success in the naval war, the capture of key terrain objectives and enemy losses.&#10;&#10;Game components:&#10;&#10;* One 22&rdquo; by 39&rdquo; full color map&#10;    * 140 1/2&rdquo; land formation counters&#10;    * 44 1 1/4&rdquo; by 5/8&rdquo; ship counters&#10;    * 16 page full color rulebook&#10;&#10;Game summary:&#10;&#10;* Playtime: 3-5 hours&#10;    * Complexity: Simple&#10;    * Solitaire rating: excellent&#10;&#10;Game scale:&#10;&#10;* Turns: 12 (each turn represents one month of real time)&#10;    * Counters: Divisions and Brigades for the land units, Capital Ships for the naval units&#10;    * Hex scale: 10 kilometers&#10;&#10;Game Credits:&#10;&#10;* Designer: Yukihiro Kuroda&#10;    * Developer: Adam Starkweather&#10;    * Graphic Artist: Niko Eskubi&#10;&#10;"

You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card under attack, and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the defense number on their unit's card.

The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&#10;&#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;"
