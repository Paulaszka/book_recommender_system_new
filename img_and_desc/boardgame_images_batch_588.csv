On a turn, a player reveals the top card from his deck and (in most cases) says either &quot;Color!&quot; or &quot;Word!&quot;, asking for opponents to yell out either the color of the text or the word printed on the card. If the first opponent to answer yells out correctly, she keeps this card (and any cards already on the table) and places it in her score pile; if the first player is wrong, the current card stays in the center of the table and the wrong player places one previously scored card in the center, too.&#10;&#10;Some cards have special functions, such as allowing the player who wins the card to peek at the top card of an opponent's deck. Other cards are multipliers and they double the points scored for cards claimed previously; to track this, you must keep cards in order as you claim them. Still other cards are &quot;Mystery&quot; cards, and the player who reveals a Mystery card should immediately ask any question at all, the more bizarre the better. The first opponent who offers any kind of coherent answer wins that card and any others on the table.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player runs out of her stack of cards, the game ends and everyone tallies their points (mostly positive but sometimes negative), summing points from bottom to top and remembering to multiply cards accordingly.

Each roll represents one day in the journey.  Magi must carry enough food and water (Supply Cards) to get to the next city or oasis.  For each daily roll, the magi must turn in a Supply Card.  If the magi run out of supply cards on the trail, then they must go back and replenish their supplies.&#10;&#10;The magi must overcome hazards on the dangerous caravan trails as they cross over mountains and through deserts, such as: blinding sand storms, attacks by robber bands, fog and clouds that obscure the guiding star, and hidden assassin spies.

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region.

The dealer deals out 10 cards for each player, one by one; the remaining 12 cards are placed in the middle of the desk, arranged in a 4x3 rectangle called &ldquo;Castle&rdquo;. The player left to the dealer starts play placing one card on the Castle; the others will follow in clockwise order. The color (red or black) of the first card played by the opener assigns the color of each team for that game: e.g., if the opener chooses to play a 3 of Hearts, he and his partner will be the Reds, and the other team the Blacks. Goal of the Reds is to score points by capturing black cards, and vice versa for the Blacks. Cards are to be placed on the Castle, on top of those already on the desk, forming piles controlled by the card on top of it. Each card has an intrinsic value that follows the natural order, starting from the Ace (1) up to the King (13). In the Castle, each card can have from 2 up to 4 neighbors, i.e. cards adjacent either horizontally or vertically. The total value of a card on the Castle is equal to its intrinsic value increased by 1 for each neighbor of the same color and decreased by 1 for each of the opposite: e.g. a red 10 having 3 red and 1 black neighbors, will have a total value equal to the intrinsic value of a Queen.&#10;&#10;Rules of the game:&#10;1 - it's alway allowed to place on top of a card another card of the same color&#10;2- a card of the opposite color can be placed, changing the control of the pile, if the card to be placed has an intrinsic value higher than the total value of the card on top of that pile&#10;3- a player can pass the turn. In that case, the opponent at his left will pick at random one of his cards. That card will be added to the piles picked up at the end of the game, possibly contributing to the score.&#10;&#10;End of the game and scoring:&#10;A game is over after 10 turns, when the players run out of cards. Each team picks up the piles topped by the cards of their color: all the cards of the opposite color inside the controlled piles are captured and used for the final score. In the final scoring, an Ace is worth 9 points, a King 4, a Queen 3, a Jack 2 and the remaing cards 1 point each. The Red team will sum up the values of the captured black cards, and the other way around for the Blacks.&#10;&#10;Two players game:&#10;The game can also be played by two players, under the same rules.

147200,,"Rising Glory is the fourth game GMT Games is producing as part of their strategic friendship/partnership with Victory Point Games, and the 2nd from their Napoleonic 20 series (Fading Glory was the first). The idea for this and future volumes is that they will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and mounted maps.&#10;&#10;The Napoleonic 20 series from Victory Point Games are lower complexity wargames which use a common system originally created by veteran designer Joe Miranda, and further refined by developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan. The system&rsquo;s name is derived from the fact that there are generally just 20 or fewer pieces in play on the map at one time (that's 20 pieces total, for both sides). The system is easy to learn and fast-playing, creating a tense, dramatic and challenging situation on the game board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. The series features twelve pages of Standard rules, four pages of Optional rules, and one-to-two pages of Exclusive rules for each title.&#10;&#10;A hallmark feature of the Napoleonic 20 series is the use of narrative random event cards to help &ldquo;tell the story&rdquo; unique to each battle or small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuver, intense combat, and even periods of inactivity as armies pause to rest and reorganize, provides a thrilling battle full of unexpected twists and reversals of fortune. Morale plays a vital role as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this precious resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to key combats. But look out&hellip; when a side&rsquo;s morale is reduced to zero, it has lost the game! The games also features simple optional rules for limited intelligence/Fog-of-War, the important shaping effects of leadership, and the gradual erosion of troop effectiveness due to fatigue.&#10;&#10;The Rising Glory multi-pack features one game each from Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, and two designs by Kim Meints.&#10;&#10;Austerlitz 20(the &ldquo;Battle of the Three Emperors;&rdquo; Napoleon vs. Kutuzov, 1805)&#10;Jena 20, 2nd edition (Napoleon vs. the Brunswick &amp; Hohenloe, 1806)&#10; Eylau 20 (Napoleon vs. Bennigsen, 1807)&#10;Wagram 20 (Napoleon vs. Archduke Charles, 1809)&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;Four 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; mounted  maps ( 2 boards, backprinted)&#10;Approximately 150  3/4&quot;  Counters (thick, with Rounded corners, like No Retreat)&#10;48 Event cards (12 for each game)&#10;One 16-page Standard Rules booklet&#10;One 16-page Exclusive Rules playbook&#10;Two Player Aid charts&#10;&#10;Individual Games designed by Alan Emrich, Lance McMillan, and Kim Meints&#10;&#10;On February 9, 2015, GMT Games deleted this game from their P500 list and gave it back to Victory Point Games.&#10;&#10;"

Once enough of a type have been Settled, players can Utilize each system&rsquo;s special ability to further their positions, scoring more points and expanding their empire!&#10;Mechanically, players will be collecting sets of System cards and playing them in front of them. A player&rsquo;s final score is based on the System type of which a player controls the lowest value, so an even balance of development is key. However if a player settles more than a critical value of a System type, he/she can utilize that type&rsquo;s ability every turn for the rest of the game!&#10;&#10;"

Longitudinal lines are also drawn connecting the points. The central circle is green and is called the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.  At four equidistant locations on the outer circle, an additional three points (connected by lines to each other and to three points on the board&rsquo;s outer edge) form Knight&rsquo;s Castles, one each named for St. George, St. Patrick, St. Andrew, and St. David. The Dragon&rsquo;s lone piece begins the game on the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair; the Knights&rsquo; three pieces each begin on the points of the Knight&rsquo;s Castle.&#10;&#10;Beginning with the Knights and ending with the Dragon, players take turns rolling a die and moving according to the results. The player will move any one of their pieces the exact number of points rolled on the die, in any combination of directions, so long as the lines between points are followed and points are not crossed or landed on a second time.  Pieces cannot move to or jump over occupied points, except when the Dragon captures a Knight. Dragons move in the same fashion as Knights, but when their move ends on an occupied point, that Knight is removed from play. The Dragon may win the game by taking two of each Knight&rsquo;s pieces. Knights may not capture or slay the Dragon, but may win by reaching the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair central point with two of their pieces. The first Knight to do so wins the game.  A Knight may not pass over the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair as part of a move; they must land there only on the end of their move. Having landed on the board&rsquo;s central point, the Knight is then removed from play and set behind his Castle to keep score.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two, three, four, or five players.  For five players, one each plays a Knight and one the Dragon. For four players the game is the same but St. Patrick&rsquo;s Knights are not used.  For three players, one player takes the Knights of St. Andrew and St. George, one player takes St. David and St. Patrick, and one the Dragon. For two players, one will play all four Knights and the other the Dragon.&#10;&#10;St. George and the Dragon takes its inspiration from the old tale of the same name.&#10;&#10;"
