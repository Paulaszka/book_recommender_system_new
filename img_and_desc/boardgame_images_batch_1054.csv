The title includes up to a maximum of four players, who can however choose from the most iconic villains of Gotham City: Bane, Joker, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler and Harley Quinn.&#10;&#10;Each villain will have a Criminal Plan to carry out, developed in different missions (such as taking control of specific territories or making certain results with the dice). Achieving a certain number of objectives will activate the character's special powers, giving the player various advantages during the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;While the villains compete for the districts of Gotham City (following the traditional RisiKo dice-rolling mechanic!), our hero is not standing idle. When five 1's are rolled during a turn, Batman goes into action, clearing one or more territories on the board and wreaking havoc in the fight for control of the metropolis. Especially in the initial stages it will not be easy to watch, but it will always be a great emotion to swoop into our opponents. It will be less pleasant when it's our turn to face the Dark Knight, but that's part of the challenge too.&#10;&#10;In addition to conquering all of Gotham, you can take home the game by completing one of three objectives, common to all participants. However, every time a criminal empire is definitively defeated, the player who accomplished the feat can choose to eliminate one of the conditions.&#10;&#10;"

At the start of each of the game's 5-8 rounds, you bid the number of tricks (0-5) you think you'll claim with the ten cards in your hand. Wait, ten cards = five tricks? Yes, because each time you play to a trick, you play two cards at once!&#10;&#10;You play the game with 1-3 suits of cards depending on your desired level of difficulty and the number of players at the table; each suit has cards numbered 0-10 and a wild, with each card appearing twice. The strongest play is a pair of cards that are the same number, with high numbers beating low ones, and with palm trees beating dolphins, which beat sunglasses, which beat pairs that are of different suits. If no one plays a pair, then whoever played the highest single card wins the trick. After five tricks, you score points if you've met your bid exactly. (If you bid a non-zero number of tricks but missed, you still score 1 point per trick taken.)&#10;&#10;What's more, if you want to play risky, you can place bets on your bids, giving you an additional way to win (or lose) points.

He also visits the restaurant &ldquo;Oily Oyster&rdquo; &ndash; your chance to put your culinary skills to the test! &#10;But there is a problem: To prepare delicious dishes, there are only three cooking pots available that you have to share with the competition. ... and there&rsquo;s that annoying pot lid that&rsquo;s always in the way and prevents you from completing a recipe. Anyone who, despite all the hurdles, prepares their dishes reasonably correctly and receives the most gourmet stars will be personally awarded the golden toque by Gustav Germ.&#10;&#10;On your turn, take 1 out of 3 actions. &#10;You can either &#10;&#10;     Draw 2 new ingredients, or&#10;     Draw 2 new recipes, or&#10;     Place 1 or 2 ingredients into a pot + move the pot lid!&#10;&#10;&#10;Pots are placed in the middle of the table and are available for everyone. As soon as one pot is filled with ingredients (amount = 6), everyone has the chance to show one of their recipes and collect points. The more matching ingredients someone has, the more points they get.&#10;Always keep an eye on the displayed menu! You can get even more points if you show the right type of recipe at the right moment.&#10;&#10;The game ends after someone has served 6 meals. The player with the most points wins the game!&#10;&#10;"
