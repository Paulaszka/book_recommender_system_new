Focus on the stories! We ask you to write your own bestseller!&#10;&#10;Just like in an unforgettable novel, there are big laughs or even deep conversations waiting for you in this game. Once upon a time, there was no one - there was once a character you bring to life&hellip;, a dramatic turn that no one expects&hellip;, and the end result that puts the crown on your work. Creativity, playfulness, communication, imagination - all of which you will need in this great party game where the story can only be limited by your own imagination. Move the threads skillfully and be the best storyteller on your team!&#10;&#10;The game lasts for 10 rounds. The first 9 rounds have 3 phases, Inspiration, Writing, and Evaluation.&#10;In the Inspiration phase, we draw 2 characters, 2 dramas and 2 end cards to the playing field.&#10;In the Writing phase, each player thinks about which combination of 3 cards they think could make the most interesting story. It is important that you choose one of each category.&#10;&#10;Everyone will write on their page the letter combinations (for example, BAA) of the selected pages next to the current round number.&#10;In the first three rounds, the text of the selected Character Cards is recorded, in rounds 4-6 the text of the selected Drama card, and in rounds 7-9 the text of the End Card.&#10;&#10;In the Rating phase, players receive points for each of their teammates who have selected the same letter combination for their story. If exactly the same combination is written, everyone gets 4 points, if only the first 2 letters match, 2 points, if only the first letter matches, 1 point goes. No points are awarded if the first letter of the letter combination does not match anyone.&#10;&#10;The tenth round is the Synopsis. In this round, we do not put new cards on the game board, but the Inspiration phase takes place from the texts of the previously selected cards. So in the Inspiration phase, we write the final story from the text of the 3-3-3 inspiration cards previously written on the scorecard.&#10;As everyone completes in a row, tell the Final Story one after the other. Don&rsquo;t forget to give the story a title.&#10;After telling the Final Story, players secretly give each other points. Everyone can split 7 points among the other players, we give the most to the one who we think invented the best story.&#10;After telling the story, everyone adds up the victory points earned during the 9+1 rounds.&#10;&#10;"

Players are trying to get their tableau of cards down to the lowest total. If a top and bottom row card match, those two equal zero. At the end of the game, the lowest total score wins.&#10;&#10;The deck is numbered 1 to 8, with one 1, two 2s, three 3s and so on. Each number is a different sea creature.&#10;&#10;Players have a tableau of six cards face-down in two rows of three. Two are turned up and the highest total starts. On their turn, a player draws either from the deck or from the discard pile. The player then uses the drawn card to replace an existing card in their tableau. The new card goes face-up, the old card goes face-up to the discard. If the player drew from the draw pile, they can discard it instead.&#10;&#10;In this way, cards gradually get turned up. The game ends when either the draw deck is exhausted, or a player has all six cards face-up. The totals are calculated, and the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;However, the game has certain twists. For example, the 4 card is actually -4. The 5 card forces another player to turn up a card, possibly ending the sooner. Sharks must be placed as shown on the shark card, and so on.&#10;&#10;Because there are more high number cards, it is harder to get the score down. But players have more chances to match pairs and make them go to zero.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;"

But you have to put your hand flat on the table again before you can return to the action.&#10;&#10;Whoever has laid the required length first, depending on the number of players, gives the signal to the others to come to the end. Now you can see who has really conjured up the best string of lights:&#10;&#10;The more light bulbs and lanterns of the same color follow each other in a line, the more points the chain of lights earns you.

Some of them can lead to your death, such as not having any food or ammunition during a shootout; others can lead to defeat, such as having a love gauge at zero, which would lead to the separation of the couple. It is therefore important to fulfill the victory conditions before triggering any defeat condition.&#10;&#10;In easy mode, the goal is to finish your run with a shoutout in a farmhouse, with two bank loot and your love gauge raised to the maximum before the police &mdash; or someone &mdash; kill Bonnie or Clyde.&#10;&#10;"

It's a creative, collaborative game with a lighthearted competitive element that uses cards and a board to make it fun and easy for players to improvise an original story. Best of all, it generates a unique tale each and every time it's played.&#10;&#10;The board provides the story arc, a plot map that packs as many cliched scenarios and overwrought plot twists as possible into fifteen squares. The deck brings the setting... a library of genre tropes and oblique pop culture references to tickle the imaginations of geeks and laypersons alike. Players and encouraged to mix, match, and try out new combinations.&#10;&#10;After a deck of tropes and a plot board are chosen, players are each dealt a hand of cards and take turns being the Narrator. The Narrator reads the prompt on the next available square and chooses a card from a pool of trope cards submitted by adjacent players (plus one random from the deck) to finish the prompt. While this may yield some hilarious results, the Narrator's work has not yet begun! Next, the Narrator &quot;sells&quot; the scene by elaborating, tying up loose ends, spicing it up a bit. Afterwards, the players redraw cards, the player whose card was picked draws an extra one, and the next player becomes the Narrator. Rinse and repeat until all fifteen squares have been played and the story has reached its thrilling climax.&#10;&#10;So, the story is over. What was the point of it all? Well, in a way, the goal of the game is to laugh, have fun, and tell a quirky story together. However, in another, more mathematical and literal way, the goal of the game is to win by having more cards than anyone else at the end of the game. But winning also comes with great responsibility! After the gloating is over, the winner then chooses their favorite scene in the story Narrated by another player. That player then becomes the Chosen One, Master of Tropes and The Uber-Winner of that round of TropeQuest.&#10;&#10;"

If battered river levees collapse, everything important to you will be washed away.&#10;&#10;Rising Waters is a co-operative board game built around area control, set collection, and variable player power mechanics where players experience life through the lens of African American plight. In the game, you will confront two forces &ndash; racism from white landowners and the power of nature. Persevere by drawing on your community&rsquo;s courage and strength from your family, church, music, farming, and education. Can you manage the rising waters to stay alive?&#10;&#10;Rising Waters is a 2-4 player game about the strength of community, methods of resistance, and the struggle against nature suitable for both classroom use and casual play from Central Michigan University Press. There are many ways to mod the game for replayability, including Community Goal Cards and individual Character Goals. There are easy and hard versions of the game, and it can even be played as a two-handed solo game! Rising Waters is played on a hex-based map of the Mississippi River and surrounding lands based on the area around Vicksburg, Mississippi. The game runs over a series of rounds representing different weeks during the flood, when players have opportunities to work cooperatively and individually to save their homes, families, and communities. During the flood, work together to keep your family and neighbors alive by minimizing losses during the flood. Players must also negotiate the arbitrary demands of white landowners.&#10;&#10;Yet African Americans weren't solely victims in the 1927 flood &ndash; as always, they maintained a sense of agency and sources of power to survive. In the game, this comes from the Community cards, which include blues, farm animals, church, garden, family, and education cards. The cards help players upgrade their abilities during the game as well as resist racism. Rising Waters serves as a powerful illustration of the difficulty of African American lives in the Jim Crow South. Through the game, players will be able to have challenging conversations about the endemic nature of racism and how it complicates life during a crisis. If players keep below the maximum level of losses for a certain number of rounds, they've survived the worst of the flood and win the game!&#10;&#10;"

All see the same result but everybody from another perspective. Each player always tries to find the best scoring category for him. &#10;But attention: &#10;Each category is available only once per game! So far so easy, if only the dice would not always disappear under the cup again so fast &hellip; Who has grasped the best result in the short term? And in which category would eventually have been more to achieve?&#10;&#10;GOAL OF THE GAME&#10;The player with the highest total score in the end wins the DICE CUP-Challenge!&#10;&#10;PREPARATION&#10;Put the dice in the cup. Each player gets a scoring sheet and a pen &ndash; and writes down his name on the up right line intended for it. Now a starting player is chosen and off we go!&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;The starting player starts rolling the dice but still everybody plays always simultaneously.&#10;Each round consists of 8 steps:&#10;&#10;     Put all dice in the cup.&#10;     Your hand above it and shake it well.&#10;     Turn around the cup with the dice and overthrow it on the table so all dice are hidden underneath the cup.&#10;     Lift up the cup for about 3 seconds (to measure the time, slowly say the following slogan: &bdquo;Lift the cup &ndash; eyes up&ldquo;). The dice must be clearly visible for everybody for the same amount of time.&#10;     Then the cup is put over the dice again carefully so that they are not turned over accidentally.&#10;     Now each player sets a cross in the little circle of the box in the category he wants to value. You can use your hand as a sight screen. Once the cross is set it may not be changed anymore.&#10;     When everybody is ready the player lifts the cup again and puts it aside so the dice result is visible for all players again.&#10;     Now everybody values his result and writes the points in the corresponding field (Example Kim see valuation). Pass the cup on in clockwise direction. The next round starts. Important: Sometimes the dice lie on top of each other. Then the dice roll must be repeated immediately!&#10;&#10;&#10;VALUATION AND EXAMPLES&#10;&#10;     Who has chosen &bdquo;count fours only&ldquo; in the upper part, multiplies the number of fours with 4 (of fives with 5, of sixes with 6). E.g. three time 4: 3 x 4 = 12 points &#10;     Who has set a cross for a colour, e.g. &bdquo;blue&ldquo;, in the middle part, only counts the eyes of the two dice in this colour and notes down the sum. Scoring of Kim 5 + 6 = 11 points &#10;     Who has chosen &bdquo;double&ldquo;, may note down 10 points for each &bdquo;double&ldquo; of the same colour. E.g. one &bdquo;double&ldquo; (red) = 10 points&#10;     Who has marked &bdquo;all ones, twos and threes&ldquo;, adds all dice pips which show ones, twos and threes. E.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 13 points &#10;     Who has chosen &bdquo;DICE CUP&ldquo;, adds the pips of all dice and&#10;&#10;&#10;notes down the sum. E.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 +5 + 6 = 36 points After each valuation the respective selected category * The dot next to the red square is used for better is of course dropped for the current game.&#10;&#10;END OF THE GAME&#10;The game ends after 12 played rounds. In the last round the cup can be left aside after the third playing step, and the last valuation (for the respective individual last category) is done at once. Afterwards every player adds the points of the three parts on his scoring sheet, transmits the sum into the fields provided for this purpose and calculates the total amount.&#10;The player with the highest total amount wins the DICE CUP-Challenge!&#10;&#10;VARIATIONS:&#10;The &bdquo;Eyes up time&ldquo; may vary as the players like or by experience. Pro players can shorten the time to 2 seconds, for example. Beginners and younger players may extend it. All players always have the same length of time available &hellip; It is also much fun to play several games simultaneously. The players have two or more columns in each category to fill in and value.&#10;&#10;Have fun playing!&#10;&#10;"
