Using a combination of wooden tiles and artisan dice, players attempt to create words based on their dice roll. Each letter die multiplies the word score. Players must then decide whether to stop and score or draw another die, roll again, and risk it all!&#10;&#10;Each letter and die has a point value similar to Scrabble. The twist is in the multiplication of your score by the number of letter dice used.&#10;&#10;In each round, the player begins by rolling one die. The player uses that die and nine wooden tiles to make a single word. The player can stop there and score, or bank the used tiles to score later, take an additional die, roll both dice, and make a new word with the remaining tiles. This new word will now be scored with a multiplier of 2 (with 2 dice). Players can continue with this adding dice and making words as long as they have tiles left. If a player fails to make a word, they score only their banked tiles with no multipliers.&#10;&#10;"

Cards must be played on your side of one of the four main Lovecraftian locations - Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth and Kingsport.

They are suitable for any scale figures and any basing standard, the only requirement being that figures are organized into units of equal frontage. A typical game has around 8&mdash;15 units on each side, and games take around two to three hours. The rules are designed from a top-down perspective, focusing on outcomes rather than detail.&#10; Sword &amp; Spear features a clever and innovative system for activating units that creates interesting and challenging decisions, keeps both players involved at all times, and has a lot of depth and subtlety. Each turn is split into phases, where players each receive a number of action dice, which are rolled and then used to activate their units. The number shown on each dice determines which units can activate (with better quality units being easier to activate), what the unit can do when activated, and also determine the activation sequence. Certain dice also give bonuses to combat, movement distance, or shooting range. So there is a lot to think about, and allocating the action dice well is the key to success (although rolling lots of sixes helps as well!).&#10; The rules are relatively straightforward, and there are no &quot;to hit&quot; tables, charts, or lists of dieroll modifiers. They can be played using only the one-sided Quick Reference Sheet, with very little reference to the rulebook after the first couple of games.&#10; Army lists are available as free downloads online, covering a wide range of Ancient and Medieval armies. These include points for each unit, so that players can play relatively balanced games by building armies to a set points total. There are currently over 40 army lists, including many of the most popular armies, and more are being added each week, with the aim to have over 100 lists available. The rules also include guidelines to help in recreating historic battles, and there are three generic scenarios included as alternatives to the pitched battle.&#10; The strengths of the game are that it gives an exciting, interesting and challenging experience, plays relatively quickly for the size of battle that is being depicted, and the rules are straightforward to learn, whilst having the depth to retain interest after repeated play.&#10;&#10;"

When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;This 2003 special edition comes in a metal box and contains the Carcassonne base game and the 2nd expansion Carcassonne: Expansion 2 &#226;&#128;&#147; Traders & Builders.&#10;&#10;"

This edition has an error on the board that has the name of the game covering part of the graphics and text on the board.&#10;&#10;Kremlin is played for up to ten turns, ending as soon as the Party Chief successfully waves three times at the May Day Parade or when so many politicians are dead or in Siberia that the Party Chief can disband the Politburo and take complete power for himself.&#10;&#10;Each turn has phases.  The most important of these are the KGB trials (which can send party members to Siberia or the cemetery) and the Defense Ministry's Spy Investigations which can also force politicians on a winter's gulag holiday.  With the KGB, the catch is that the higher up the ladder the target, the more difficult to bring down, and Party Chiefs tend to change KGB leaders who take shots at the top...  For the Defense Minister, his investigations require a trial to be successful--and a guilty vote, and that isn't always possible in the Central Committee.&#10;&#10;The catch?  Players allot influence secretly at the start of the game and don't reveal it until it is used, meaning no one knows who controls the KGB or any other ministry, not until Influence is revealed--and even then, who knows who still has undeclared influence on that person?  It is possible that players can swap control back and forth over the KGB chief even as he is trying to determine who to assassinate!&#10;&#10;Once the carnage is done, players have to survive the ravages of aging--and every time a politician takes action, he ages faster than normal...your 50 yr old star of the party?  Well, suddenly he's acting like he's 83, Comrade.  Life near the top will do that to you.  In the Health phase, politicians may die or grow sick--sick politicians can choose to go to the hospital, but while there, they exert no influence and their responsibilities pass on to other politicians. Sometimes this means your man must make the heroic sacrifice to the Rodina and remain on the job even while at death's door.&#10;&#10;Once we know who is still alive, the Party Chief is allowed to move politicians between posts.  After all, he's in control of the bureaucracy.  He can move people up and down, and when he's done, upper ministers do so as well--but can only affect politicians below them on the food chain.  Heck, politicians can even sponsor comrades in exile in Siberia to come back to the People.  Of course, each person you bring back ages you five years....want to bring back five?  Age 25 years in the blink of an eye, Tovarich.&#10;&#10;Intrigue cards allow you to take control of situations or foil other players' schemes.  In one of the older versions, you could have things like Chernobyl take place in 1920.  That's been corrected--so that while events may be the same, they have now been made era-appropriate.&#10;&#10;The turn ends with the May Day Parade.  If the party chief is healthy, he can wave throughout the day making people happy--clearly our socialist union is prospering.  But if he's sick, sometimes he leaves early and is unable to wave, sending doubts through the ranks.  If a faction (player) earns three waves, they win the game.&#10;&#10;The Jolly Roger version provides three different KREMLIN games in one box.&#10;&#10;&#10;     The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia.  This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.&#10;     A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'.  Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians.  It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game.&#10;     A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution.  This version introduces the concept of &quot;Going into Exile&quot; to avoid Siberia.  It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

News spread around the world and the era of the 49&rsquo;ers began. Thousands of young people left their farms and homes to make their fortunes out west.&#10;&#10;As these pioneers swarmed to California, hundreds of mining camps sprang up throughout the Mother Lode. Eight miles from the gold discovery site, a camp known as &ldquo;Old Dry Diggins&rdquo; was established. By 1849, it became known as &ldquo;Hangtown.&rdquo;  There are many stories as to how this infamous nickname came to be, but the most common is that in January of 1849, after a very brief trial, three men were hung from a large oak tree near the corner of Main and Center Streets&mdash;an act of swift justice, as they say.&#10;&#10;In April and again in July of 1856, most of Old Hangtown, now bearing the name Placerville, was destroyed by fire. Buildings were ultimately built of brick and stone thereafter. In addition, a large bell tower was erected in the center of town as a fire warning system. By then, people had begun to value the area for more than just mining. The region had an abundance of lumber and rich agricultural land, making it perfectly situated to grow into a thriving community.&#10;&#10;_____________&#10;&#10;In the game of Hangtown, players become Gold Rush era Pioneers who are competing for riches, resources, property, and prestige. &hellip;They must also be prepared to deal with outlaws, shootouts, and hangings at the infamous Hangman&rsquo;s Tree!&#10;&#10;The game features a thoughtful variety of streamlined mechanics, which are notably innovative, yet traditional and familiar in feel&mdash;such as fresh spins on tableau building, worker placement, simultaneous action selection, variable turn order, and resource and hand management.&#10;&#10;Some of the best strategies in Hangtown rely on a balance between optimizing one&rsquo;s own scheme and cunningly &ldquo;playing the players&rdquo;. A standout theme in the game is &ldquo;Boom or Bust&rdquo;. If a player can get &ldquo;out of phase&rdquo; for a turn, he or she will profit from a &ldquo;Boom yield&rdquo; and get bonuses, while the other players may go &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; and get very little. But of course, this takes sharp wits and some clever guesswork&hellip;&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds, which break down into a series of turns and phases. In a turn, each player selects one card that will determine the phase that his or her Pioneer will take action in. When the players are ready, they simultaneously reveal their chosen cards and place their Pioneer pawns in the corresponding yield sites on the board.&#10;&#10;Then the phases are resolved in numeric order as the players take their Pioneers&rsquo; actions. The total number of Pioneers in each yield site determines whether the outcome is Boom or Bust. To whatever degree, the different site actions allow the players to place workers, activate workers, collect resources, and add cards to their face-up tableau areas of historic buildings, districts, and monuments. Every card built in a tableau grants the player new abilities as well as Victory Points for the final scoring.&#10;&#10;After each turn is completed, the looming Outlaw pawn advances into the next section of the board, locking that particular yield site into a Bust outcome. Furthermore, when the Outlaw lands in the last section, it triggers a &ldquo;Final Shootout&rdquo;! In this special phase, all of the players must defend themselves against the Outlaw&rsquo;s bold attack by using gunmen positioned on Main Street. If the players beat the Outlaw, they gain additional Victory Points as a reward. But if they fail, they must send their lost gunmen to their early graves in the Union Cemetery&hellip;&#10;&#10;The Wild West theme of the game is based closely on the California Gold Rush of 1849 through the turn of the century. The city of Placerville, also known as Old Hangtown, has a rich history, which has been worked into the game at every juncture. For instance, the town cards feature historic landmarks such as the Bell Tower, Soda Works, and Studebaker Wheelbarrow Shop; while the periodic &ldquo;Events&rdquo; feature the Wagon Train, mail delivery from Snowshoe Thompson, and digging up The Mother Lode at Gold Bug Mine. Many beautifully restored historic photographs and illustrations are included as well.&#10;&#10;Hangtown plays wonderfully with two to six players, and it can be set to play in two separate modes: Discovery for newcomers and casual gamers, and Highgrade for seasoned gamers and experienced players. The modes appeal to a wide range of folks and settings&mdash;from light family fun to heavy brain burning. The game also includes an expansion that opens up bidding on several character roles. These roles, such as the Robber, Deputy, Prospector, and Gunslinger, allow each player to use a unique special ability for one entire round at a time.&#10;&#10;The game offers many paths to victory and great replayability.&#10;&#10;"

At ten o&rsquo;clock, the charge of the Royalist gendarmes hit the first line of Huguenot cavalry despite the deadly fire of the artillery commanded by Sully. But the counter-charge of Navarre, Cond&eacute; and Soissons shifted the course of the battle and destroyed the morale of Joyeuse&rsquo;s troops.

Then the youngest player begins by taking at random any card from the player to his left in the hope of matching a new pair. If he makes a pair with this new card, he places it face up on the table, and takes another card from the same player to his left. If not he keeps the card and the next player takes his turn and play continues thus, until there are no more pairs. Gradually as &#10;the game progresses the players are able to assemble the Misti&rsquo;zzle a tableau presenting images of the stories of Jean de La Fontaine.&#10;&#10;"

U.S. starts with 19 units, Germans with many more.  Playing time is a couple hours.&#10;&#10;Special Peiper, Bayerlein, and Abrams leader counters and a Skorzeny 150th Brigade Brandenburgers unit are included, as well as the 2 historical Tiger tank battalions.  (Some offensive-shocked GIs were reporting any panzer as being a Tiger tank.)&#10;&#10;Fuel is unlimited for the Americans and crucial and weather-dependent for the Germans - vs. Allied airpower.  My Patton's Prayer rule (for better weather) from my hex-and-counter Tigers in the Ardennes is included, as is a rule for the chance of a &quot;blonde and beautiful&quot; U.S. Army nurse diverting Bayerlein's attention, as occurred historically and possibly decisively on his/Panzer Lehr Division's way to Bastogne.&#10;&#10;Map and units can alternatively be used with Major Battles and Campaigns combat system.&#10;&#10;"

There are 6 tile series with different pictures. 3 series of 16 tiles each (steamboat, wonder machine, sun flower), 2 series of 9 tiles each (flowers of the spring, bird), 1 series of 6 tiles (helicopter). The basic idea is that one tile of each series has the least amount of small details, another one the greatest amount of details (like with or without doorknow depicted, a bee with or without wings etc.). These cards must be sorted according to the amount of details picted from least to most in ascending order. A check is possible by turing the tiles around. On each tile back is one half of an animal or thing - horse, train car etc. If the cards are in correct order those halves match.&#10;&#10;The rulebook suggests 3 games:&#10;1) Solo game: The solo player takes one or more tile series, shuffles them and must lay them in the correct order. &#10;2) Group game: The short helicopter series is done away with. Each player gets one tile series (well shuffled). Players start to put their series in order. The first player to do this wins - if he did correctly. This can be done with one round or in several rounds. If rounds are played the player who finishes first and has his order correct he gets victory points equal to the number of tiles in the series plus 5 extra points. The other players get one victory point for each tile that is in correct order. For the next round the series are shuffled again and each player gets another series than before.&#10;3) What is disappeared: A series is laid on the table in random order. The picture with the most details is laid in the middle. Players look out for the tile where just one little detail disappeared then the next one etc.&#10;&#10;"

Each platform is worth a different point value from 10 to 40 points. If you land on a gray base or get stuck on a branch, you score no points. If your frog lands on the table or anywhere besides the game base, pick it up and try again. To launch a frog, press down on its rear to fling it forward. As your finger slips off, the frog should jump toward the platforms. Once all frogs are somewhere on the game base, the game ends. Count up your points, and the player with the most points wins. This game is for two to four players. It comes with a Kung Fu Training Center game base, 20 frogs (five of each color), and a sticker sheet.&#10;&#10;"

Play a Battle Point Card, and draw your enemy into battle. Loser loses a turn. Winner gets an extra chance to draw an unlock-able card. Weapons and characters are hidden within the deck.
