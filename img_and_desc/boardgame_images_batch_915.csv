Players take control of 1 or more of 3 dueling factions: the Pagan, the Chosen, or the Fallen, by constructing a deck prior to the start of the game. Each faction offers unique abilities and strategies to the game play. The game comes with a full playable set of all cards to choose from.&#10;&#10;Each player will have 2 draw piles that make up their deck, preventing players from being flooded with card types they don't need as they can choose which to draw from: a character draw pile made entirely of character cards, and an arcana draw pile made up of relic and spell cards. Additionally each player must start the game with 1-3 leader cards in play, which each offer unique abilities that are unlocked as they level up by killing opposing characters. Players may have a mix of factions within their deck as long as the have a leader for each faction. Lastly a shared draw pile of immortal cards are set aside at the start of the game, containing 1 of each immortal card. Players are able to summon these powerful cards only by taking enemy characters prisoner during combat, and then waiting until their next turn to sacrifice the prisoner to the immortals.&#10;&#10;Rather than using resource cards or counters, cards are played using a delayed purchase mechanic referred to as the cool down system. Cards are put into play expended (rotated 90 degrees clockwise) 0-3 times, representing the number of turns that must be waited for the card to be usable, as cards only cool down (rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise) once per turn automatically. Likewise, abilities and attacks require cards to expend 0-3 times when used. Players must manage when their cards are ready for use to make sure they aren't left open to attack. Each faction offers unique key abilities that let you cool down cards faster in different ways: the Pagan by drawing cards, the Chosen by attacking, and the Fallen by casting spells. Strategically utilizing these abilities is key to gaining advantage over opponents.&#10;&#10;Golden Serpent takes place centuries after the Chosen conquered and thought to have exterminated the Pagans, ancient people who ritually worshiped the god of balance and the god of chaos (the Golden Serpent). When a group of Chosen missionaries stumble upon a crumbling Pagan temple housing an evil book left on earth by the Golden Serpent, the spirit of chaos is unleashed into the world and the Fallen faction is created. Now the few Pagan people left come out of hiding to stop the Fallen from summoning the Golden Serpent to earth, and war erupts between the 3 factions.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The War is also known as &quot;The 10 Cent War&quot; or &quot;The Saltpetre War&quot; as it was fought over taxation and mining rights in the Atacama Desert.  Although not well known in Europe the War had long term effects in South America and its peace treaties were only finally implemented at the end of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;The armies of both sides had learned a lot from the Franco Prussian War and were equipped with fairly modern weapons and European style equipment and uniforms. Their attempts to mirror European tactics were met with varying degrees of success as they came to terms with fighting with breech loading rifles and machine guns. The armies were small by the standards of European Wars or the American Civil War, making it a War that is reasonably easy to assemble forces for and refight on a tabletop.&#10;&#10;The War is well served by excellent quality, readily available books in English (including an Osprey), and figure ranges in 10mm, 15mm and 28mm. The armies are colourful with an interesting array of uniforms. The Bolivians even had a cuirassier regiment! If you can't wait and want to read more of the background, the Wikipedia pages are very good.&#10;&#10;The rules were written to be played on a squared grid, but also contain adaptations to play conventionally with measured distances. The mechanisms are original but simple to learn and make use of a Disorder mechanism rather than figure removal, so all of your figures stay on the table for longer. Because of the use of the grid the rules are suitable for figures in all scales and basing. Infantry regiments, for example, are made up of 4 bases. It is unimportant how many figures are on each base, - you could even represent units with 4 figures and play on a large chess board if you are short of space.&#10;&#10;The rules include a short history of the war, a uniform guide, sample orbats, Regimental flags you can scan and use and unique characteristics for many of the well known commanders of the War. There's also a Bibliography and a list of manufacturers with suitable figures from 6mm to 28mm.&#10;&#10;A bit obscure, perhaps?

Bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under. This is why a good balance of winning and losing the tricks is important.&#10;&#10;Buddha uses a 70-card deck that consists of:&#10;four suits Element cards (Air/Fire/Water/Earth) numbered 1-14, &#10;five Yin cards [a Yin card never beats a card], &#10;five Yang cards [a Yang card always any numbered card], &#10;two Yin-yang cards [can be played as either Yin or Yang cards],&#10;one Buddha card [beats all the other cards except the Black Hole card],&#10;one Black Hole card [nobody wins the current trick].&#10;&#10;The game lasts six, five, or four rounds depending on the number of players: &#10;&#10;    In a six-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 14, then deal each player 11 cards, you should have a 66-card deck to start with,&#10;    In a five-player game, deal each player 14 cards, &#10;    In a four-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 12-13-14, then one of the Yin cards and one of the Yang cards, then deal each player 14 cards, you should have a 56-card deck to start with,&#10;    In a three-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 11-12-13-14 , then keep one of each of the special cards, deal each player 15 cards, you should have a 45-card deck to start with.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points after six (six-player or three-player game), five (five-player game) or four (four-player game) rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, all players take a look at their dealt hands, then simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out their fists and on the count of three, revealing a certain number of fingers.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads an Element card, then all other players must follow the same Element, if possible. If a player leads a Yin card, then the second player determines the Element led. If a player leads a Yang card, the Buddha, or the Black Hole card, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases, a player may always play an unnumbered card, even if they hold cards in the same Element led.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matches his/her bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, he/she scores 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player misses his/her bid, he/she loses 10 points for each trick that he/she was off, whether it's more or fewer than predicted. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, he/she scores 20 points if successful, plus he/she wins points equal to the highest bid made times 20, if he/she misses their bid, he/she loses 20 points for each trick he/she takes.&#10;&#10;Whoever has the most points after X rounds, wins the game.&#10;&#10;-description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The game is played on the points of a tri-gridded hexagonal board, with flippable checkers and stones. The objective of the game is to capture one enemy king, or bless one friendly king.&#10;&#10;Players begin with a king on their starting point in opposite corners of the hex grid. Players fill their zone, which includes all points adjacent to the starting point, with men. Men are defined as a checker or stack of checkers. By default, men start with a stack size of 1 checker. Men move in any direction in a straight line, distance up to size of the moving stack or sub-stack. Stacks jump occupied points, but may not move onto or jump over blocks. Captures happen by replacement (like in chess). Capturing does not depend on stack size (small stacks can capture large stacks, and vice versa). New men can be created by merging and splitting stacks (which are defined below). By default, men are limited to making stacks no higher than two checkers high. To create stacks taller than two checkers high, at least one of them must be blessed, by interacting with enemy walls.&#10;&#10;The main mechanisms of Benediction are blessings, curses and kings. Blessed men can merge once with any friendly man. Points on enemy walls, which have the power to bless men, are adjacent to the opposite end of the board via each line of the grid (like a portal). Movement across enemy walls results in teleportation of pieces across the board via forward and diagonal-forward movement. If a man moves past enemy walls, he is blessed. If you connect your wall to the enemy wall with a connected chain of friendly men, they all become blessed, except those that are cursed. Cursed men, which become cursed when stacks split apart, cannot be blessed and can only merge with blessed men. Finally, players have kings. Men that land on any starting point, or that merge with a king, automatically become kings. Because kings cannot merge with kings, and kings cannot get cursed, the number of kings can increase until a player is no longer able to defend them all.&#10;&#10;Players alternate turns of two actions per turn (12* protocol). The five possible actions include: Move, Drop, Block, Merge, Split. These actions are defined as follows: &#10;&#10;     Move = Move man to an empty point (or capture). He can't move again this turn, but he can merge or split. If he moves past enemy walls, bless him.&#10;     Merge = Move man or sub-stack onto a reachable friendly man. If a man is moving through enemy walls in the process of merging, bless him. Before completing the merge, remove any blessings/curses on the pieces involved.&#10;     Split = Move sub-stack to empty point (or capture). Curse both resulting stacks. If the sub-stack moves past enemy walls, bless that sub-stack instead.&#10;     Drop = Drop a new man on an empty point in your zone. He can't move this turn, but he can merge.&#10;     Block = Put black stone on an empty point. Blocks cannot be placed on adjacent points or on opposite ends of the same grid-lines. Men can&rsquo;t jump / move onto blocks.&#10;&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
