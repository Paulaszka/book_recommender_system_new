As fellow villains bad guys, it's up to you to orchestrate an escape!&#10;&#10;Villains &amp; Henchmen! is a (mostly) cooperative board/card game for 1-4 players, in which you acquire super powers, battle heroes, and overcome obstacles to break the super-villain out of a maximum-security prison.  The game includes four (4) different prisons, with their own set-up rules, victory conditions, and defeat conditions.&#10;&#10;In order to accomplish their goals, players draw a hand of 5 cards from the communal &quot;Villain&quot; deck.  These cards include Attack cards, Defense cards, and Power Surge cards.  Attack cards are played on heroes, guards, and obstacles in order to defeat them.  Defense cards are played to overcome certain obstacles, as well as protect players' hands from the hero &amp; guard abilities that otherwise make them discard cards and reduce players' effectiveness on their turns.  Power Surge cards are used to overcome certain obstacles, but more importantly are used to purchase super-powers.&#10;&#10;Players can acquire different combinations of abilities, choosing from among 22 unique super powers.  These powers run the range of classic powers, including Super Strength, Time Control, Energy Blasts, and others.  Powers allow players to break or augment the normal rules of play, making their hand of cards go further and hit harder.&#10;&#10;As the players defeat heroes and guards, they acquire victory points.  If the players succeed in defeating the scenario, the player with the most Villain Points gets bragging rights as the &quot;winner&quot;, claiming the title of villain and relegating the other players to mere henchmen!  If the game wins, then all the players lose regardless of points, so teamwork is essential.&#10;&#10;"

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.&#10;&#10;The German NSV edition of The Game on Fire is a special version of The Game packaged in a tin with a playmat and an &quot;On Fire&quot; mini-expansion. This expansion consists of six flaming cards (22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77) that replace the regular cards, and when one of these fire cards is played onto a pile, that card must be covered by the end of the next player's turn or else players have lost the game.&#10;&#10;The U.S. edition of The Game on Fire will have the six flaming cards in the box in place of the other cards, and it won't contain the playmat.&#10;&#10;"

National and corps-level leaders are represented, on a map at 500 meters per hex, with 1-hour turns. Five scenarios are included: three that separately cover the north, central, and southern sectors of the battle, as well as a combined full battle scenario, along with a small introductory scneario. The combined scenario is suitable for up to four players (France, Sardinia-Piedmont, Austrian 1st Army, and Austrian 2nd Army).&#10;&#10;The battle itself was a grinding slugfest often described as a &quot;soldier's battle&quot; - a deliberate slight to the often uninspired leadership of the generals and a tribute to an allied victory gained only at the tip of the bayonet. Villagers in the surrounding region would do their best in the days after to treat the myriad wounded, and answer as to why Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, and Slovaks were treated as well as the Italians: &quot;Tutti fratelli&quot; (All are brothers). The battle pits two Austrian armies against the combined forces of France and Sardinia-Piedmont, and features the full panoply of colorful period units - Jagers and Grenzers, massed cavalry divisions of all types, Bersaglieri, French Imperial Guard, and the French African Zouaves and Turcos. Advances in infantry and artillery firepower would soon make the tactics of the time obsolete, and the carnage at Solferino reflected the start of this paradigm shift, soon to be highlighted bloodily by the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars.&#10;&#10;This treatment of Solferino features an adaptation of Hermann Luttmann&rsquo;s Blind Swords system (At Any Cost, Hammerin' Sickles, Stonewall's Sword) as the core ruleset. The system is heavy on unpredictability and fog of war due to the chit pull mechanic. The chit pull mechanic also very much aids in solitaire play, as does variable activation rules and reinforcement tables. A number of other features help make face-to-face play attractive, including  a number of scenario variants and optional rules, a free-setup full battle scenario, and the move-and-countermove of event chit play. Nation-specific event chits also inject some period flavor.&#10;&#10;"

Progressing in a set pattern determined by the play mat, these orders are then sequentially revealed and resolved.&#10;&#10;Combat between units on the board is resolved following the same sequential pattern as resolving orders cards. To resolve combat, players add up the relevant combat skill for the current unit and any situational modifiers (such as the type of unit opposing a unit, whether the unit is charging that turn, or any orders cards affecting the unit) to determine how many dice to roll. Each die rolled which meets or exceeds the target unit&rsquo;s current &ldquo;defense&rdquo; value for its current status level scores one &ldquo;hit&rdquo; and permanently reduces that unit&rsquo;s status by one level. As each unit&rsquo;s equipment listed on its card gives certain bonuses against certain unit types, often while imparting a penalty against other unit types, players can gain an advantage by careful use of their deployment and orders to pit their units against their optimal opponents. Units decrease in effectiveness as they take hits, becoming weaker in both offense and defense. Each unit has three status levels ranging from undamaged to heavily damaged. Any unit reduced by hits beyond its third status level is removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The winning player is the one with the last unit remaining on the board.&#10;&#10;"

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;"

The answering player may choose from questions ranked from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest) and gains points equal to the difficulty level on a correct answer.  Incorrect answers gain no points.  After one question, the next player takes a turn.  Players play until the deck is used up or to an agreed total.&#10;&#10;Upward Mobility is played similarly, but each player starts off being asked question one and proceeds through the questions to number five, earning the point value for each question answered correctly until he or she answers wrong.  So, for example, if a player answers questions 1,2 and 3 correctly but misses #4, the score would be 6 points.  Like Trivia Party, play continues until the deck is used up or until one player reaches an agreed point total.&#10;&#10;In Auction Trivia, each player starts with 25 points.  One player chooses a card and reads the 5-point question.  Players then bid on the card.  The highest bidder then wins the card and tries to answer all five questions on the card, gaining points for each question answered equal to the point value of the questions (for a maximum of 15 points per card).  These points are added to his starting point balance.  The winninbg player then becomes the next auctioneer.  Players are eliminated if their balance drops to zero.  The player with the most points when all cards are used up wins.&#10;&#10;In Trivia Poker, score is kept in the same way as Trivia Party.  However, when a player answers a question correctly, he or she keeps the card.  Players try to gain cards to build the best poker hand possible.  When a player gains a sixth card, he or she must discard any chosen card, keeping five cards.  The game ends when all cards are used or when all players hold five-card poker hands.

Spin the spinner! Earn martinis! Offend your friends and relatives!&#10;&#10;Each round, a new player is Stewie, the host of the party. Stewie spins the spinner to determine the theme of the party and draws a party card. Stewie's guests help throw the party by offering word cards to fill in the blanks of the party card. Guests score martinis by collecting sets of Family Guy characters on their word cards; Stewie scores martinis when the guests agree that the completed party card matches the theme. When the booze runs out, the party is over and the player with the most martinis wins!&#10;&#10;"
