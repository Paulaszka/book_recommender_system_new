While the color and number arrangement is the same on all player boards, the starting point differs on each board. (The second edition of Tr&auml;xx includes a pad of individual score sheets instead of erasable boards.)&#10;&#10;To play, shuffle the deck of fifteen cards, then reveal the top card, which will show four or five colored hexagons. Playing at the same time, each player takes an erasable pen and draws a path on their game board &mdash; with this path starting at or at least passing through the starting point on their board &mdash; that covers up to as many hexagons as were revealed, with the colors of the hexagons in your path matching those shown on the card. Thus, if the card shows two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow, then your path can cover at most two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow.&#10;&#10;Once all players have drawn their path, reveal the next card, continuing the path in either direction and covering only as many hexagons of the proper colors as is shown on that card. A path cannot cross itself.&#10;&#10;When your path crosses a number, call out that number. If you're the first one to reach it, you'll score that many points at game end; if others have reached it first, you score half this many points, rounded up. Once you've finished all fifteen cards, the game ends and you lose one point for each space not covered. Whoever has the highest score wins!&#10;&#10;"

To earn this title, you must complete dangerous scenarios in the shortest possible time frame. The most innovative element of the game is that the player uses their own 30-second sand timer as a character to be placed on the ship to perform actions. Each time a player places their own sand timer, they have to wait for the sand to run out to be able to perform the action needed. Each hole in the ship represents an area where you can perform a specific action: turning the ship, loading cannons, shooting enemy ships, repairing damage, and so forth...&#10;&#10;A Tale of Pirates (previously announced as Admiral of the Black) has ten different scenarios, ranging from ordinary pirating activities like looking and shooting, to kraken-hunting, prison breaks, treasure hunts, and much more. An app for any smartphone or tablet will lead the players along the missions, assist with scenario data, random events, multiple paths, upgrades, and gamestate-saving for later sessions. It also serves as a timer for the individual round as the typical scenario lasts 2-3 rounds, each five minutes long.&#10;&#10;The players have to react to events and maneuver the ship to fight enemy gunboats, catch rich merchant vessels, and avoid other obstacles. They must communicate to agree and organize things to do, but they have to be quick because time is always ticking.&#10;&#10;A Tale of Pirates is swift playing with simple rules, but it's exciting and involving, with great interactions among players. Unlike some other real time coop games the stress is present but not dominating. The thirty-second delays, in addition to the intermittent rounds, always allow you to catch your breath!&#10;&#10;"

The battles, included in the scenario booklet, focus on the historical deployment of forces and important terrain features of trench fighting in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a few infantry units may represent an entire wing of a larger battle, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave soldiers going over the top.&#10;&#10;The Command card system drives movement, creates a &quot;fog of war&quot;, and presents players with many interesting opportunities, while the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The Combat cards add an element of suspense and will challenge players to coordinate their use in a timely manner. Overall, the battlefield tactics players will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various types of WWI units, their weapons, battlefield terrain, and written history.&#10;&#10;In this core game, the main focus is on a number of WWI trench warfare battles. However, a series of expansions, which will feature early war, Eastern Front scenarios, tanks, airplanes, other national armies, plus more special personnel figures, are already in the planning stage to enhance your WWI gaming experience.&#10;&#10;"

Over three ages, players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders. What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players.&#10;&#10;Players do not draft cards simultaneously from decks of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;"

The game supports 3-8 players, and plays in about 10 minutes.&#10;&#10;The dealer shuffles the deck of cards (one per player in the game), and deals one, in turn, to each player, calling out the card each time. Once both the &quot;Goose&quot; and &quot;Caboose&quot; cards are in play, these player race to call out the other players names, going clockwise around the table. The winner scores a point. The cards are shuffled and the game continues until someone scores three points.&#10;&#10;But wait! There's more! The &quot;Goose&quot; and &quot;Caboose&quot; players can get tripped up and have to start over if they don't say the names right, or if they don't call the other racing player &quot;Doug&quot;. Everyone else is in charge with keeping the racing players honest.&#10;&#10;"

The name Captain&rsquo;s Quarters is a reference to the nautical theme but also a pun. Each of the 26 flags in the alphabet are divided into quarters creating 104 graphic tiles. Like other tile rummy games, the tiles are used to make groups that can be rearranged to create new groups; however, you will find out quickly the quartered flags add a revolutionary type of gameplay.&#10;&#10;The goal is to be the first player to play all of his or her tiles after assembling at least two nautical signal flags correctly.&#10;&#10;Captain&rsquo;s Quarters is a fresh new addition to the world of rummy and mahjong both thematically and mechanically.&#10;&#10;"
