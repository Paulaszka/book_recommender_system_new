Play your hand. Throw things at your friends.&#10;&#10;Throw Throw Burrito is what you get when you cross a card game with dodgeball. Try to collect matching sets of cards faster than your opponents while simultaneously ducking, dodging, and throwing squishy airborne burritos. The cards you collect earn points, but getting hit by flying burritos loses them. So clear some space and put away the antiques, because you&rsquo;ve never played a card game quite like this before.&#10;&#10;How it works: Place a pair of burritos on a table and draw cards. Keep your cards a secret. Rack up points by finding sets of three in the deck. Find matches before anyone else does. If someone plays Burrito Cards, a Battle ensues. Steal points from your opponents by hitting them with squishy toy burritos. Declare war on your friends. Some battles only involve a handful of players. Others force the entire table to engage in a Burrito War. Duel to determine the winner. During a Burrito Duel, two players must stand back to back, walk three paces, and FIRE.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

What are those categories, and how is an answer correct? Read on...&#10;&#10;To set up the game, lay out the yellow, green, and red loops so that they overlap like a Venn diagram and form seven specific regions: yellow-only, yellow-and-green, all three colors, etc. Each player represents one of these colors. Each player chooses a category in secret, with the category being something that can easily divide answers into &quot;belongs&quot; or &quot;does not belong&quot;. Examples might be things with four legs, foods, games by Reiner Knizia, things you can cut, and school subjects. Each player writes something that belongs in their category, then the other two players move those answers to the proper region. (If you're yellow, for example, you must give an answer that belongs in the yellow category, but that answer might also belong in the red or green category as well.)&#10;&#10;Following this set-up, on a turn one player places a token in one of the seven regions, e.g., inside the red and green categories but outside the yellow one. Each player now gives an answer that matches the status of their own category, then the other players say whether or not your answer is placed in their categories or not. If your answer fits within the proper region, then you score a point and leave the colored portion of your answer sheet visible; if it's not in the proper region, then you hide the colored portion (to show that you don't score), but leave the answer visible to give information to other players.&#10;&#10;The first player to score 1 point in all seven regions or to score 8 points total wins.&#10;&#10;"

Take this game with you.&#10;&#10;Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game (or FoF) is based on the Tarot, in use since the 14th century for games and since the 17th century for divination. The art for Fellowship of Fools dates back to 1761 to its creation in France by Nicolas Conver de Marseilles and is called the Tarot de Marseilles. Today, Tarot cards are widely used  for game playing, creativity, divination and personal development. Our hope is that FoF can turn that inward reflection of the Tarot outward to help players develop friendships.&#10;&#10;We&rsquo;ve split the Tarot deck into its two parts&mdash;-the Major Arcana for Situations and the Minor Arcana for Topics. On each card are two different prompts&mdash;-corresponding to the upright and the reversed meaning of the card. Numbers next to the prompts indicate their difficulty, possible points that can be gained or lost for playing that prompt, as well as the number of Topic Prompts that can be played for that Situation Prompt.&#10;&#10;There are multiple ways to play Fellowship of Fools: The (Friendship) Game: solo, with two players, or with multiple players.

You have 3 types of cards: Animals, Kingdoms and Extras. Animals are your creatures, your babies, you take care of them. Each animal belongs to a kingdom. There are 6 Kingdom cards: Alpacas, Flamingos, Pandas, Unicorns, Sloths and Dinosaurs. Your goal is to own 3 animals of your kingdom on your field, complete of their &quot;poop markers&quot; aka being Wise. Extra cards can help you doing that! EXTRAS are 2 different types: TRICKS (can be used unlimitedly and in any moment) and TREATS (can be played max 2 per turn unless specified otherwise). Each turn has different phases. The first thing you want to do is to position &quot;poop markers&quot; on your animals card (does not apply in the first player's first turn). You get 1 poop marker per animal. Then you draw 2 cards, choosing between the 2 decks (animals deck, extras deck), the combination is up to you (1/1, 2/0, 0/2). You can play a maximum of 2 cards per turn, if there aren't cards in your field allowing you to play more. Playing cards, the player should try to prevent opponents to stack poop markers on animals while trying to fully stack his own animals. The winner is the first player owning 3 wise animals on his field. During the &quot;stacking poop&quot; phase, poop markers can't be prevented, so be sure to clean up the poop you want to delete before the next player's turn's begin (before your ending phase, to be clear).

To complicate the matters further, all packages look the same and animals first need to open them to see what's inside. All the animals rush wildly for the clearings where food packages appear...&#10;&#10;The object of Jungle Chase is to collect as many food packages as possible before they run out. Players do so by controlling six animals each of varying strength on a hexagonal board representing a jungle with clearings and landing spots for food packages. On their turn, players roll two six-sided dice to determine which animals may move one space each, with doubles enabling special moves. When animals of opposing players meet the stronger animal chases its opponent off the board.&#10;&#10;Contents of food packages are hidden from players and a player whose animal enters the package space may look at it without revealing the contents to other players. If the food is appropriate for the animal, the player may now collect it. When all packages, whose number is determined at the beginning of the game, have been collected the player with the most food is the winner.&#10;&#10;Jungle Chase is a &quot;classical&quot; board game with game pieces, dice and a board with a very deliberate old-school feel and yet quite modern in it's final execution in terms of tempo, duration etc. Basic mechanics and inherent logic are quite simple and yet the game strives to offer enough depth for an adult to enjoy the game as well.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

The game consists of 36 animal tiles and the Jungle Speed totem.  The tiles are comprised of 8 each of a monkey, elephant, giraffe, and zebra along with 4 lions.  All the tiles are placed face-down in a grid just like &quot;Memory&quot; with the totem placed at the center of the grid.  Each player takes turns flipping over one tile in the grid making sure each player has seen it and then replacing it face-down in its original place.  As soon as a flipped tile matches one that has previously been flipped (not including the lions), the players race to grab the totem.  The player who is fastest to the totem now has to turn over the correct matching tile hopefully remembering where it is.  If they are successful they collect both tiles and put it in a pile in front of them.  If they do not flip over the correct tile, they are frozen and can not grab for the totem until they use their next turn to become unfrozen.  When a player flips over a lion tile , the tile is removed from the grid and placed on the side of the grid.  When the fourth lion tile is flipped, the game immediately ends and the player with the most tiles wins.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summary&#10;&#10;"

It can be played in 4 different ways, providing exciting variation and wide age range appeal.  One of the games aimed at young children is a simple mix and match stlye game. One of the other games is a Top Trumps style of selecting a category and the highest value wins. The other two of the game variations are trick taking games that involve trying to create the most powerful creatures and battling them against your opponent.&#10;&#10;The game contains 72 cards, including 60 character cards and 12 special action cards.  The 60 character cards include 20 Head cards, 20 Torso cards, and 20 leg cards.  Combined in the right sequence, these cards create 20 fearsome characters ready to do battle, however, when the cards are mixed with cards from other characters they can create up to 8,000 unique characters each with their own unique name and powers. You will create crazy, scary, funny, unusual and wonderful characters to battle and try to defeat your opponents.&#10;&#10;Mix &amp; Mayhem cards can be played in 4 different ways, You Complete Me, Wipe Them Out, Skirmish, and Bunch of Fives. The rules for each game are described below.&#10;&#10;You Complete Me!&#10;Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards. Shuffle the Character cards and place them in a pile&#10;face down.&#10;Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then each player takes it in turns to take a card from the pile and lay them face up in front of them. As the game progresses each player will be able to mix their cards to create weird and wonderful creatures as the game progresses.&#10;The winner: The aim is to be the first player to create one of the 20 original characters made up of the set of correct 3 cards. If neither player is able to create one of the 20 original characters before the cards are all drawn then the cards are collected, re-shuffled, and drawn again until there is a winner.&#10;&#10;Wipe Them Out!&#10;Preparation: Split the cards into 3 separate piles for Heads, Torsos and Legs (including the Action cards which are also marked on the back of the card as Head, Torso and Legs cards). Shuffle each pile and deal the cards face down to each player so that each player has their own separate piles of Head&#10;cards, Torso cards, and Leg cards. Each player should have the same number of body part cards.&#10;To play the game: Each player picks up the top card of each pile of body parts so they have a complete character, with a Head card, Torso card and Legs card. If they pick up an Action card instead of a character body part they should keep this and draw another card from the top of the pile until they have a character body part. The Action cards that they may have picked up can be used during the game. Players hold the cards facing themselves, so only they can see them. Decide who goes first, then that player will select a category &ndash; either Brains, Strength or Speed. Each player shows their card to reveal the value of the chosen body part. The player with the highest&#10;value wins the battle and the player with the lowest value must discard the body part card that lost. Then the loser must pick up the next top card from their pile of the same category until they have a complete character again. The winner of the battle can keep the same cards in play. However, each card can only be used a maximum of 2 times to win a battle. After an individual body part card has won 2 battles it must be discarded and a new one drawn. Players will take it in turns to select a category. Both players must always have at least 3 cards in play, including a Head card, Torso card and Legs card in addition to any Action cards that have been collected. To create some extra mayhem the Action cards that have been drawn by players during the game can be used when it is their turn at any stage of the game. Once a player uses an Action card it must then be discarded.&#10;The winner: The object of the game is to defeat your opponent by wiping out a pile of their cards so that they are no longer able to make up a full character and therefore unable to continue to battle. When a player is unable to make a complete character they are defeated and their opponent is the winner of the game.&#10;&#10;Skirmish!&#10;Preparation: Shuffle all of the cards (Character and Action cards) into a single pile.&#10;Playing the game: Each player will take it in turns to draw a card from the top of the pile. The cards are laid face up so they are visible to both players.  When both players have a complete character of a Head card, Torso card and Legs card they are ready for battle. Players can create the character of&#10;their choice to battle with from any of the character cards they have drawn. Each turn, players have the option to challenge their opponent to a battle, or to draw another card to&#10;try and create more powerful characters. Once a challenge to battle has been made by either player, the characters they both have created for the battle must be declared and put side by side. The total character score is calculated by adding together the brains, strength and speed values, and the player&#10;with the highest total character score wins that battle.  If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. The player who makes the challenge may think they have the most powerful character because they&#10;can see the values of their opponent&rsquo;s characters, however, their opponent may create mayhem by playing one of their Action cards that they have collected to swing the outcome of the battle. A player can use one or more Action cards at any time. Once a player uses an Action card it must then&#10;be discarded. The players continue to draw further cards and engage in new battles with new characters until all&#10;cards have been drawn and there are no further complete characters in the remaining cards held by both players.&#10;The winner: The player who has won the most individual battles once all the cards have been drawn&#10;wins the game.&#10;&#10;Bunch of Fives!&#10;Preparation: Remove all of the Action cards from the deck and deal all of the remaining character cards into separate Head, Torso and Legs piles. Each player will be dealt 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards, allowing each player to make up 3 separate characters. The cards are laid face down so they are not visible to the opposing player.  Each player should then privately arrange their cards to create 3 different characters with their own unique name and overall value.&#10;Playing the game: Decide who goes first, then that player will lay down one of their characters to engage in battle with their opponent. The other player must then choose and lay down one of their characters. Whoever has the highest total score (by adding together the brains, strength and speed values) wins that hand. If a player is able to create one of the correct 20 unique character sets then their overall character score is increased by an extra 10 bonus points. Players will take it in turns to lay a character first. Once all 3 characters have battled the players will then be dealt another 3 Head cards, 3 Torso cards and 3 Legs cards for another round of 3 battles.&#10;Following the second round of 3 battles there will be 1 final round of 3 battles, so there will be 3 rounds of 3 battles making a total of 9 battles. &#10;The winner: The first player to win 5 battles is the winner of the game. It is possible therefore to&#10;win the game outright after only 2 rounds without the need for the final round.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

But business is anything but usual. As they broker contracts and flirt with crime, merchants must avoid arousing the suspicion of the Venetian Inquisition, lest they find themselves arrested and their businesses shut down.&#10;&#10;In the game, players move their two gondolas around the board. When they move a gondola, they may activate the assistants they have placed previously on any building they pass, but they may train (and improve the capabilities of) only the one on which they end their movement. Assistants allow you to gain resources, trade, make money, and take an array of other actions depending on the buildings to which they are assigned. When resources are made, they are placed in the gondola, and these will be used to fulfill lucrative contracts.&#10;&#10;Space is limited on the city's canals, however, and each time you pass another merchant's boat, gossip will spread, raising your suspicion level with the Inquisition. Lower your suspicion with visits and donations to the church, or academic institutions &mdash; or throw caution to the wind and engage in unsavory activities for money or information. During the game, being such a well-known merchant can be a boon to your political career, but at game end, the most suspicious player will be made an example of by the Inquisition &mdash; blocking your victory even if you have the most points.&#10;&#10;Includes solo mode by David Turczi and Xavi Bordes&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players play as modern day travelers who have been spirited away by the Archangel Gabriel (the GM) to partake of this journey.  Players must go through a series of scenarios, drawn randomly, during which they are offered choices by the GM which then dictates what challenges and choices they next face.  Players must conserve equipment and, most importantly, time on their journey, while also working to increase their individual attributes of Authority and Reputation.  The game uses the REAL System - a mechanic where the players do actual, physical interactive challenges at various points as part of the gameplay, the outcomes of which determine their progress in the game (such as identifying objects moved by the GM in a given room, finding commonplace house items within a certain time limit, or dexterity challenges). Once the players have gone through all 8 scenarios, they arrive at Bethlehem where which ending they've achieved is based on how much time they used on their journey.  The GM guides the players using 'The Book of Adventures' which contains step by step instructions for each scenario and narrative text that is read to the players.&#10;&#10;The game is geared primarily towards families and can be played by multiple age levels from age 8 and up, but with the caveat that an adult always play as well and serve as the GM.  The total campaign with all the scenarios takes 4-6 hours to play, but the game can easily be saved between the scenarios, with each scenario taking roughly 30-60 minutes to complete.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"
