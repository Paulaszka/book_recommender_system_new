Many have already fallen to the invading Danes, leaving the great kingdom of Wessex standing alone and defiant under the command of King Alfred. You are one of the great commanders and politicians in this war-torn land known today as England. Both Saxon and Dane armies openly battle for dominance, and it is up to you to title the scales of power. To claim these lands, you will need to tread a dangerous path between both sides of the conflict. Will you betray your allies for power? What part will you play in the birth of a new nation, and will you ultimately rule it all?&#10;&#10;The Last Kingdom Board Game plays over the course of two rounds during which players will perform actions to command armies to shape the course of the war. Your allegiance to the Saxons or the Danes can be firm or fickle, and your score will reflect not just your prowess in battle, but your political skill in maneuvering the competing forces of Britain.&#10;&#10;Each of the ten leaders offers unique benefits to your strategy and provides special cards to start your hand. At the start of each round, players complete their hand by drafting cards from a deck specific to that round, then the war begins in one of the five regions. Players take turns playing cards to command Saxon or Dane armies, gaining affinity with the different factions, or positioning their heroes and leaders to shift the tides of war. Players also have access to a rotating market of actions that are available to everyone.&#10;&#10;Alternatively, players may choose to not act on their turn and instead pass to see what moves their opponents make.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed consecutively, the war in the current region will be decided by the strengths of the Saxon and Dane armies battling there. Players gain victory points if they are aligned with the winning faction and based on their level of affinity. The focus of the war then moves to the next region, and the battle continues.&#10;&#10;After the fate of each of the five regions has been decided, the round ends. After two rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins.&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

Whoever manages to discard all his deck and cards in hand, will have won. Also, if someone finds a pair of Flora or Fauna among the stacks, he must mention them, causing his opponent to move that pair to the bottom of his deck.&#10;&#10;In game 2 (Revelations) each player also has a personal deck, but no hand is used. Each player, in a clockwise direction, will reveal cards to the table. If any player at any time finds a pair of Flora or Fauna, he can cover them, and thus take them to his area on the table as a trophy. Whoever puts together the most pairs until the cards in each deck run out will have won. If any player incorrectly covers, he will not be able to cover until he passes his turn again.&#10;&#10;Finally in game 3 (The Only One), we must go removing cards from the hands of others, to form pairs in our hand and thus discard them. Everyone will try to be without a hand, in order to get rid of it, and only one will be left with a card that does not have a partner.&#10;&#10;"

The game is designed for 1-3 players.&#10;&#10;All three of the King Sanchos, including any non-player Sanchos, are competing to win by fortifying the castles and towers illustrated on the board (one in each region). Players gain victory points for each castle or tower fortified with their pieces: 3 points for a home castle (2 points in the solo game), 2 points for a neutral castle, and 1 point for a tower. If at any time during the game a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, they win a major victory. If no player achieves this during the game, the Sancho with the most victory points after the last card is played wins a minor victory.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. Each player has a turn during each round. At the start of the round, the commander for the round plays a card from their hand. This card indicates the number of command points (CPs) from 1 to 3 that the commander uses during the round, and it also describes the actions that each other player must take on their turn, if possible. The game ends either at any point when a Sancho has 10 or more victory points, or after the final card from all players' hands has been resolved.&#10;&#10;"
