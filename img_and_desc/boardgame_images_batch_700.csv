A Game of Super-Villainy is a casual card game where players assume the roles of villains and attempt to defeat the superheroes of The City. The only thing standing in each villain's way, are the other villains.&#10;&#10;Villains have access to action cards that allow them to steal cards, force discards, counter other villain attacks, and so on. If only the villains worked together, they could easily defeat the arrogant superheroes, but they are too concerned with getting all the credit to work together.&#10;&#10;The heroes are represented in the form of cards that are played out of a separate Hero Deck. Each hero has an attack value, that also doubles as their point value at the end of the game. The heroes also have their own superpower that trigger when they are defeated. Some of these superpowers will help the attacking villain, others will hurt the attacking villains, and some will hurt every villain!&#10;&#10;The game is over when either of the decks run out of cards. Once the game is over, each player's Victory Points are totaled and one villains is declared as &quot;The Greatest Super-Villain of All Time!&quot;&#10;&#10;"

Eight colored balls immediately fall down into the tube in a random order. As soon as the eighth ball lands on the top, the game begins and the race is on. Players start flipping and stacking their cubes to perfectly match the order of colors in the tower.&#10;&#10;Players must be careful, however, as each cube holds a different combination of colors.

Of course, this is a risk if the outlaws consider you dangerous.&#10;&#10;Unlike the werewolves, the outlaws can have a special character too. The priest, or even the hero, can be an outlaw.

The simultaneous mission feature of BetaBotz allows all players to participate during missions. There is a high level of engagement and interaction between the players so that everyone can have a blast through the entirety of game play!&#10;&#10;Players start BetaBotz with 40 bitz (currency) and use this starting pool to bid on a robot body with stats in four attributes (Agility, Firepower, Structure and Processor). Throughout the game players use their remaining bitz and any bit rewards received to bid against one another on components that increase their attributes or select single use &quot;Code Cards&quot; in an effort to complete missions. In addition to components increasing a robot's ability to complete missions, achieving a stat of 13 or more in an attribute activates a power associated with that attribute.&#10;&#10;A complete game of BetaBotz is played over the course of ten missions. Mission cards of different tiers are selected based on the number of players. Missions require at least a specific value in one (or multiple) of the four attributes to complete. All players attempt to complete the current mission simultaneously and those that are successful receive a reward of bitz. Players are able to form teams to complete the current mission but they must split the mission rewards among the team. At the conclusion of the 10th mission the player with the highest individual attribute, the most gold components and code cards each receive an additional bitz reward. The player with the most bitz at the end of the game, including the bonus bitz, is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
