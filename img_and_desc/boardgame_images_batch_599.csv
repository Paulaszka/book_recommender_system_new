151340,,"A trick-taking card game focusing on expressions from Bologna's dialect. Players try to avoid taking suits of unlucky events going around the table by either adding a more powerful event of the same sphere, or trumping the suit with an event of a different sphere (the three spheres being home, work or street). If not avoidable, the trick taking can be mitigated by playing a swear word card, or by a Socc'mel card, which transfer the suit to another player. Goal of the game is pushing the other players anger-meter (&quot;incazzometro&quot;) beyond 10 to eliminate them from the game.&#10;&#10;The game is marketed for ages 6 up, with the explicit proviso that obscenities from Bologna are widely accepted and not considered offensive (which is the case, to some extent...).&#10;&#10;"

Facts: each card represents a fact from a biography (for example, &quot;She wrote a book&quot;, &quot;Something is named after her&quot;, &quot;She was imprisoned&quot;, etc.).&#10;2. Professions, such as &quot;politician&quot;, &quot;actor&quot;, &quot;soldier&quot;, etc.&#10;3.

Countries, such as &quot;USA&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, or &quot;Russia&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each round one of the players chooses a deck, reveals the top card and reads its text aloud. Then everybody tries to name a famous person that matches the task of the card. The fastest player reveals the top card of one of the remaining decks, and now the players try to name the person who matches two criteria, and so on.&#10;&#10;For example, if the cards &quot;C&quot; and &quot;She wrote a book&quot; were revealed, it's possible to name Julius Caesar, Winston Churchill, Clive Barker, or any other person with the first &quot;C&quot; in his/her name (or surname, or nickname) and known as an author. If nobody could name a person after the next card was revealed, than the player who had correctly named the previous person wins a round. You cannot reveal more than 4 cards (one per deck): if someone has managed to name a person with 4 cards, he wins that round.&#10;&#10;The game is played till one of the decks is depleted.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;96 cards (24 per deck)&#10;2 blank cards for your own tasks&#10;rules&#10;&#10;"

The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.&#10;&#10;Launch into this risqu&eacute; adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.&#10;&#10;How to Play&#10;&#10;ILLEGAL is played in two phases:&#10;&#10;During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player's deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.&#10;&#10;The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.&#10;&#10;At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!&#10;&#10;"

Zombies don't care about money, political power or fundraising; they only care about brains. Not even the quality of brain eaten, merely the quantity.&#10;&#10;So you and your friends (2-4) set out upon the grandest adventure: to eat as many brains as possible from the hapless humans! But be wary, for the humans are not without the means to defend themselves, and the fattest zombie may soon become the dead undead!&#10;&#10;Playing Fat Zombie only takes about twenty minutes, even if you have never played the game. You and your friends are Zombies that wander the streets, looking for delicious brains! On your turn, you draw the top card of the deck and play it for all to see. You will then roll the die to see if you eat the human, if he escapes or hides, or if he kills you.&#10;&#10;"

On their turn, a player rolls three dice and then crosses off as many numbers as possible, typically in order, by matching them to the numbers on the dice or sums that these add up to. E.g. a first-turn roll of 6-1-1 would allow crossing off the numbers 1 and 2, and a lucky roll of 4-2-1 would mean crossing off every number from 1 to 7. Rerolls may be allowed as long as at least one number was crossed out on the previous roll, except after scoring the first 12.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach the end of their sequence, 1 to 12 to 1, is the winner.&#10;&#10;Variations concern for instance restrictions on the order in which numbers may be crossed out; restrictions on the use of dice; whether there are two 12 spaces or just one; and whether and how re-rolls are used. If numbers can only be crossed out in strict order, player advancement can be recorded using individual tokens on a single path of numbered spaces.&#10;&#10;Similar games include Everest, Mount Everest, Roll and Score Dice Derby Game, and Tolvan&#10;&#10;"

After creating core profiles and heroes, you have over 60 options at your disposal that can be used to equip and upgrade. These include unit designations, weapons, armor, standards, traits, abilities, and gear.&#10;&#10;The VERSUS game engine layers mechanics and interactions in such a way as to provide a truly innovative and unique gaming experience.

Anytime that you are called upon to roll dice, you may instead choose to take the default; this is equal to half the value of the die. This choice of risk versus reward is behind every decision in the game.  These die types can be improved in steps depending on which weapons a unit is equipped with and what type of unit it is combating. This system of soft and hard counters means no complicated tables or stat lines are needed, yet it rewards the application of both tactics and strategy.&#10;&#10;The game can be played at any scale, and players may use armies already based for other popular mass battle systems. Speaking of basing, there is no individual casualty removal in the game so hobbyists are free to make each unit a mini diorama.
