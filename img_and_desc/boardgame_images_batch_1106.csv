To do so, the will have to defeat creepy monsters and fight in desperate duels against other heroes. But that is not all, because randomly a magic storm of colors will hit this epic history. Only then players can get magical items, forge the cromatic crown or paint their bold characters.&#10;&#10;RULES SUMMARY &#10;Players play turns as follows:&#10;1. MOVEMENT. The player rolls the die and moves his HERO on the map. If the HERO lands on any other square than a CITY, the player draws an ADVENTURE card. In cities, the player can roll again or rest. If a HERO lands on a square already occupied by another HERO, they could DUEL.&#10;2. ADVENTURES. Another player draws a card from the ADVENTURE deck and reads it. &#10;- ENCOUNTERS: The player rolls the die. If the number rolled is the same as or higher than the MONSTER's difficulty level, the player wins.&#10;- RIDDLES: A question related with color and painting must be answered.&#10;- TRAPS: Resolve the effect on the HERO (or player) and keep the card if it is a permanent card.&#10;- MAGIC BOOM: Stop the game and start the CLOCK for painting.&#10;3. MAGIC BOOM. In this pase players get their brushes and paint with the colors available in their inventories. While the CLOCK is running they can: &#10;- CRAFT MAGIC. Each player may paint the HERO miniature.&#10;- FORGE MAGIC ITEM. Players may paint two gems on the base of their miniatures. They must be two colors from different lands.

Once the phalanxes begin to move in on each other there is little scope for tactical finesse or complex manoeuvre. Light troops and cavalry play a subordinate role &mdash; harassing and annoying the enemy and driving off enemy skirmishers.&#10;&#10;-description from rules&#10;&#10;

Such a German effort, if maximally successful, would likely have caused a three-to-four-month delay in the historic timeline of the Anglo-American advance into Germany.&#10;&#10;In turn, that would have allowed Hitler to concentrate greater forces in Poland to seriously slow or defeat the Soviet offensive there in January, causing a similar delay in the Red Army&rsquo;s seizure of Berlin.&#10;&#10;Each game turn represents 12 hours. Each hexagon on the map is three km (1.86 miles) from side to opposite side. The maneuver units for both sides are primarily divisions, but also include some separate brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies. Allied air supremacy is (just as it was historically) hampered by the winter weather prevalent across the fighting front for most of the period covered by the game, and it is therefore represented only abstractly regarding those effects. This game is the second volume of a series of four games, the Alternative Battles of the Bulge Series.

As soon as it turned out that you&rsquo;ll be cooking the main course, many Gourmets and Locals flocked around the fire to see what you are up to. Their expectations are high and very much different. You will really have to get it together to impress these guys! And you will have to pay attention whether it is a critical kitty or a seasoned chef you want to blow away. Well, what are you waiting for? Start cooking like the Eskimo dress up! (Quick!)&#10;&#10;Guly&aacute;s is a half-cooperative game where you will need to cook a soup under changing circumstances but working together the whole time. That is until one of you thinks that it&rsquo;s ready and yells &lsquo;Guly&aacute;s!&rsquo;. Your guly&aacute;s is considered successful when its value reaches 13 points. During the course of the game, you will have to cook more than one guly&aacute;s. You will get a different amount of victory points for every meal you cook, depending on whether the soup was successfully made, or which Gourmets were impressed. The ultimate winner will be the person who is the best at navigating between the sneaky Locals, the other chefs and the whims of the Gourmets. And most importantly whoever reaches 7 victory points first.&#10;&#10;The game is played through several rounds, the players cooking a separate guly&aacute;s in each one of them. The players take actions in clockwise order and can decide between three actions: put an Ingredient in the cauldron, distract a Local or stir the soup. Each player has one Ingredient card in their hands, the active player draws another card - unless they stir the soup - and pick one of the two to take an action. The cards you use always go face down on the game board. Each Ingredient has a separate value so you cannot possibly know the exact value of the guly&aacute;s, plus the Locals can steal ingredients from the cauldron if you don't distract them. So take extra care before yelling 'Guly&aacute;s!'. If you were brave enough and yelled 'Guly&aacute;s!' you will have to check the point value of the soup. If you were right and the cauldron does have 13 points worth of Ingredients in it, you get 2 Victory Points. If you were wrong, all the other players get 1 Victory Point. The players have the option to get additional Victory Points by guessing the Gourmet conditions right. After yelling 'Guly&aacute;s!' but before calculating the value of the soup, the players have to guess if any (or both) of the Gourmet conditions are met. If you guessed right, you get an additional Victory Point for each Gourmet. Good luck chefs!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Only played animals matching the same nature reserve (colour) as those in the market allow you to take a card and score the animal played. If you cannot take a card matching your nature reserve, you draw a blind card and score no points.
