Everyone cooperates for the good of the humanity, but the game is competitive. Resources are public, meaning if you produce, any player can use the resources at the table. The objective is to gain points with the Federation government being the faction with the best performance in 4 categories (technologies, production, colonization and influence).&#10;&#10;The mechanic is card driven where players, instead of playing an action for themselves, play an action that can be done by everyone, at the cost of placing their emissaries on the card. Players reveal the cards simultaneously, so each turn the player chooses which one he wants to activate. If the card the player played is activated by another player, he earns Solaris credits. Credits can be used in a variety of ways, from buying resources to activating certain actions. At the end of the game they serve as a wild resource for scoring if not used. Solaris is a management game with a lot of planning.&#10;&#10;Colonies are represented by dice and the die value indicates the level of development of the colony. The more developed it is, the more it will generate credits and also colonization points. Tech cards give you unique abilities and also tech points, while building buildings allows you to earn production points and, of course, generate resources. Finally, there are public goals that when achieved allow the player to gain more emissaries to use and give points of influence.

Players maneuver brigades -- whole armies can be fielded to re-play entire battles over the course of a normal gaming session.

Time, figure, and ground scales are higher, making for shorter, more decisive actions.&#10;&#10;The emphasis is on army and corps-level command: the functions of lower-level generals and officers are handled by the system. This speeds play, and lets players focus on commanding armies instead of regiments or brigades. The game does not use dice, and allows one or more players to use a device to moderate play. The interface is simple and easy to use.&#10;&#10;The system is built on a large body of research into the weapons, formations, and doctrine of the period, hiding this complexity to let players experience a more detailed level of simulation in a fast-play format.

How will we all work together to save it from contamination?&#10;&#10;The players are specialists in their own right taking unique roles with the knowledge and the power that they bring in to save the situation and find a solution. A separate deck of cards for the abilities and contamination levels and land and river tiles for the various zones make up the components of the game.&#10;&#10;Players use cards and place tiles to move around the board. The game ends when the last contaminated zone tile has been removed.&#10;&#10;Players must together plan their strategy to mesh with their expert's strengths in order to prevent contamination. For example, the Tribe head can identify and find cures for ecosystem contamination, and the bio-Scientist needs only four cards of particular contamination to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the contamination is spreading rapidly and time is running out.&#10;&#10;If contamination spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they stop and regenerate the ecosystem, they all win!&#10;&#10;"

This game is the last in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years' War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV.&#10;&#10;As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France&rsquo;s borders. That was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King&rsquo;s ultimate aim, that was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis&rsquo; war of middle age &ndash; a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men. There was not even supposed to be a war, only a demonstration of France&rsquo;s power. France was engaged in a long process of securing her eastern and northeastern frontiers. Louis felt his prestige was on the line when some of his German neighbours &ndash; specifically the Elector Palatine and the good burghers of Cologne &ndash;&nbsp;refused to give him what he wanted. A strong message needed to be sent. Also, by taking military action the French would put heart into the Turks, who were fighting a losing battle against the forces of the Holy League; keeping the Ottoman Empire in the game would ensure the Holy Roman Emperor could not support the minor powers who were the real object of King Louis&rsquo; wrath. But, things did not go as planned. &#10;  &#10;In Army of the Rhine, you will have a chance to change history &ndash; and perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books. As the Allied commander you lead a motley collection of troops. They are nearly all German, but that means very little. In the Empire, a prince only contributes greatly to the Cause if he expects to be greatly rewarded; otherwise, he will contribute as little as he thinks he can get away with. And, because the princes have the option to aid either Emperor Leopold or King William of England, they can play the one off against the other without being accused of letting the side down. Vienna may tell you to expect 30,000 men from Brandenburg, only to learn their Elector has chosen to fight in Brabant this year, because King William paid him in advance. And as for expecting help from the Emperor himself, forget it. French passivity in the face of your outstanding defense of the frontier last year has given him the excuse to siphon away yet more resources to his never-ending Hungarian war.&#10;&#10;"
