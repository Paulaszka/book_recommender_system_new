With that much power, it is inevitable that he will destroy the mighty Kingdom and undoubtedly everyone in it. The King is looking for brave leaders to recruit heroes, gain power within the guilds, and race through the dungeon to destroy Blasphemy. Will you adventure through the realms?&#10;&#10;Adventure Realms is a worker placement and deck building game in which you will recruit new heroes, gain power within the guilds, and race through the dungeon. Gain powerful elemental stones to enhance certain items and heroes and gain extra end game victory points. You can also complete quests by meeting certain requirements. Stuck in lower levels of the dungeon? No worries, just play some devastating magic cards to gain the lead in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Adventure Realms is completely done in beautiful 16-bit graphics by FinalBossBlues and graphically designed by Pete Jank. It is reminiscent to the old school Super Nintendo games such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they will play 1 of their hero cards and place an agent into an Agent Space. These spaces will gain you specific rewards. On top of that, the hero card you played will also give you specific resources or abilities for that turn.&#10;&#10;The objective of Adventure Realms is to gain Journey Flags to race through the dungeon. Once everyone has passed on their turns, players will enter the dungeon phase in which magic cards can be played to boost your levels in the dungeon. The player who had traveled through the dungeon the furthest will gain the first player rewards. The game will continue like this until a player has gained 10 victory points or until the dungeon deck has run out.&#10;&#10;"

The other player represents the historically victorious ideal of agreeing to Concede the Sudetenland territory, in order to prevent bloodshed and hoping that Hitler&rsquo;s demands would stop there.&#10;&#10;The game adapts the crisis modeling system originally introduced in Fort Sumter and then further developed in Red Flag Over Paris. The game does not make any judgment about whether it would have been the right choice for Czechoslovakia to defend itself in 1938, nor whether such a defense could, in any sense, have been successful. Instead, it allows you to experience for yourself this crisis period of 1938, which forever influenced Czechoslovakia's path and the eventual course of World War II.

English language fluency is required.&#10;&#10;When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion website (compatible with all smartphones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct.

They must work to seal these escapees back into the book. However, the demons are actually Demons of Numbers and therefore the players cannot speak in numbers (or else be cursed and die).&#10;&#10;The basic gameplay is the same as The Game, where players work together to discard all cards into four piles depending on the UP/DOWN conditions of each pile. During their turn, players discard either a larger or smaller value card(s) as appropriate. Afterwards, players refill their hand.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;Players cannot share the numbers of the cards in their hand with other players but must find ways to collaborate in order to effectively place cards in the four piles so that all players can have zero cards in their hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;If there is an exact difference of 10 between the card a player discards and the last card in a pile, the player is free to play the card regardless of the UP/DOWN direction of the pile.&#226;&#128;&#168;&#226;&#128;&#168;&#10;&#10;In Demons of Numbers, there are also six types of effect cards (which are number cards with an effect written at the bottom): Reverse, Skip, Short, Draw 2, Silence, and Declaration of Death.&#10;&#10;There are three types of ending results for the game: Total victory, victory, and loss.&#10;&#10;--&#10;&#10;Additional Information:&#10;&#10;This all new game builds upon the original The Game with additional rules for a spookishly fresh gameplay experience.&#10;&#10;Unlike The Game Extreme which added rules to make gameplay even more challenging for players, Demons of Numbers offers a more interactive, conversational experience. The new design also allows for up to 6 players.&#10;&#10;Familiar &ldquo;effects&rdquo; are added to the game to give it a more UNO-esque familiarity. In fact, these changes have earned this version of the game the nickname &ldquo;The Game Junior&rdquo; by the original publisher.&#10;&#10;The increased player number, new rules, and random events make it more difficult for players to find a repeatable pattern to beat the game and result in a making Demons of Numbers more of a &ldquo;party game&rdquo; for all ages and for gamers and non-gamers alike.&#10;&#10;The designer, 326, felt that the original The Game had a title that was really not ideally optimized for easy internet searches, as well as artwork that would make it for children to convince their parents to purchase the game for them. He wanted to take a new approach and was able to find a willing partner in Arclight Games.&#10;&#10;Illustrations are also by 326.&#10;&#10;"

Get ready to dive deep into running a chai tapri (tea shop) by ensuring that your customers get their specific chai and snack orders on time. Earn their appreciation for every correct order, but be quick as another player might steal a few of them away. Run the most successful shop, and be the wealthiest player at the end of the game!&#10;&#10;Each turn in Chai Garam, players take one mandatory action, either selecting up to three ingredients from the display (tea leaves, additives, water, milk, godown power cards, etc.) or serving their cooked tea to the grid of customers in the central board and collecting money.&#10;&#10;Additionally as free actions, players need to cook tea, compete for goals to improve their star ratings, attract customers to their own shops, or play a &quot;Chai Garam&quot; card to take a double action! The game continues until a special &quot;evening&quot; customer triggers the end of play or any player achieves five stars. At that point, whoever has the highest value from money as well as stars wins.&#10;&#10;"
