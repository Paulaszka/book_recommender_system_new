Very little time passed before Zogar was up to his old ways. His first order of business was to create panic in the city above and to make his presence known. He sent out his best thieves in the cover of night to steal the king&rsquo;s crown. In the morning the king saw the crown was stolen and in its place a piece of paper with a crudely rendered eye scratched onto it.&#10;&#10;Word spread quickly and the city was both scared and on high alert.&#10;&#10;Your task is to sneak into Zogar&rsquo;s lair and reclaim the crown, and escape alive, in order to restore peace and calm to the city!&#10;&#10;You are attempting to steal back the crown from the evil wizard Zogar.&#10;&#10;First you must turn off the four lanterns in each corner to reveal the hidden crown in the center. During this time you move one space and then flip the tile you left behind. This is to simulate there being light and you being able to see where you are heading.&#10;&#10;Once all four lanterns are turned off you must flip the tile you plan to move to before moving and you leave the tile behind you alone. This is to simulate darkness and it makes things a bit harder. You must draw a little bit on your memory as well.&#10;&#10;You then make your way to the crown. Now you must do everything in reverse to escape. Once all eyes are turned back on the stairs are revealed again in the center, and you begin to move and then flip the tile behind you again.&#10;&#10;All the while you are drawing the attention of the Zogar. If you gain 14 Spot Tokens during the course of the game you are captured and you lose. You will also have to deal with monsters and traps that will steal your health away. Loose all your health and your journey ends.&#10;&#10;To deal with combat, you have four personal player tiles and another separate character marker. You move the marker to an adjacent tile and flip the one you left. You take the result of the tile you land on. If you fail to defeat the enemy, you loose one health token, and must move to another tile until you defeat them. This requires strategy and is a tense little puzzle in itself.&#10;&#10;There are some treasures that help you out that you can find like daggers, health potions, and holy symbols, but your wit and cunning as a player is what will garner you the victory!&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

In each round, players have to roll 3 dice to decide the player order and then take turns to place their dice one by one to any available function on the main board. The dice result also decides the number of resources that could be taken from the supply. A player can always kick out the other player's dice on the main board if their die is smaller than others and all spaces on that function are occupied. Each round has an event card that requires players to pay certain resources at the end of the round.&#10;&#10;Some worker placement areas allow for cards to be played for ongoing effects or cards may be played into a city structure (ala tile-placement) for more bonuses.&#10;&#10;The game also provides variations that make functions on the main board evolve during the middle to late game.&#10;&#10;"

Its good location, the large gardens that surrounded it and its proximity to the Wax Museum were the incentives for a good number of people to decide to open their business there.&#10;&#10;Its many shops, crossed between generations, filled the area with life and color. Unfortunately, this situation would not last forever. The mysterious disappearances began to happen in the neighborhood, night after night. With them, businesses lost their customers.&#10;&#10;The result? The wonderful street turned into a dark and gloomy space. The only one who seemed to dare cross it was an old journalist, moved by his curiosity. He knew that a murderer was on the loose, but how to find him? In these cases, a saleswoman in a clothing store seems as suspicious as a vagabond ...&#10;&#10;After an intense investigation, he found the answer. He hurried to call the neighbors to communicate their suspicions, but when they arrived at the newsroom, the situation they found could not be much worse: the journalist had disappeared and, with him, any evidence.&#10;&#10;Inside the Strange Case of Morgue Street, we found a brochure entitled 'Rules of the Game'.

Two players each set up 52 different circular paper markers representing different military units and officers. Different types of units can move and fire in different patterns around them. Each turn a player can move or attack with up to five units and five officers.&#10;&#10;Combat is deterministic based on the combat power of different units in close combat or when firing at enemy units at a distance. If one side is strong enough in a battle an attacked unit can be either eliminated or captured. If an attack is not strong enough the difference in combat power is recorded, per unit type, so that the next battle against a unit of the same time becomes easier. The remaining strength of individual units are not tracked, only an abstract counter per type of unit.&#10;&#10;Units in a player's capital city, located at two opposite sides of the board, can be covered and moved without revealing its type to the other player, providing some fog of war and introducing some uncertainty into the otherwise deterministic combats. Each player is allowed to have 10 covered units or officers.&#10;&#10;A player wins by eliminating the highest ranked officer of the other player, the king.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user summmary&#10;&#10;"

Wild new abilities and sneaky enchantments are now in play as Knights work to free themselves and their teammates.&#10;&#10;The first team to escape their towers by removing all tower sections win - unless the dragon is in the game and frees themselves and an unsuspecting Knight's last tower card to snatch victory. Tower sections are removed in a variety of ways including: playing the last card from your hand, matching a word in play (out of turn play), and playing special spell cards.&#10;&#10;Into the crazy mix of silly word spell casting, Sparkle*Kitty Nights adds bluffing and cooperative team play. Players now may choose to remove tower sections from other players they believe are on their team - but were they mislead? Did they just free the Dragon? The dragon is used when there is an odd number of players, but commands special powers, such as being able to expose themselves at any time to become immune to certain effects.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

You will grow a tree by placing branch cards in clever arrangements, making a happy home for your Kodama!&#10;&#10;Kodama Duo is a card placement game for 2 players that plays in 30 minutes. Players will turn over one Decree card per season to set the unique conditions. During the Growing Phase, players take turns revealing branch cards and splitting them into two piles until each player has added four branch cards to their tree. In the Kodama phase, players will each choose one of their Kodama to score and live in their tree. The game last 3 seasons (12 turns) and whoever cares for their Kodama best will be remembered for generations!&#10;&#10;There are a couple of cool twists on the original Kodama rules for Duo.&#10;&#10;First, instead of a display of branch cards to choose, each turn one player (the splitter) will reveal three branch cards from the deck. They will then split those cards into two piles. The other player (the chooser) will select one of the branch piles. The other pile will go to the splitter. Then, both players will add one of the branch cards they received to their tree. The player who received two branch cards will discard the extra card.&#10;&#10;Second, Duo introduces spirit tokens, which are tokens with the six features from Kodama. After the player that received two branch cards discards one, the other player receives a spirit token from the discarded branch card. They pick one of the features from that card and take the corresponding spirit token. That player then places that token over one of the icons on their tree. This allows interesting scoring interactions as feature chains can be shortened or lengthened to increase the scoring potential for future branch placements.&#10;&#10;Additionally, most of the new Kodama cards and Decree cards interact with the spirit tokens and splitter/chooser mechanic. All of these changes provide an interesting twist on the core mechanics you already love about Kodama.&#10;&#10;Duo also introduces the ability to play Kodama: the Tree Spirits with six players. With this update, we've included new rules for branch selection. Each player will secretly choose from four branch cards simultaneously in a draft format. Players will also be allowed to place and score their branch cards simultaneously. This will shorten the downtime that could have been added by including more players.&#10;&#10;"
