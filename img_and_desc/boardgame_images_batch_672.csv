This edition is very portable, with two decks of small sized cards. One deck is the Tenbo cards, showing scoring points in values of 10P, 5P and 1P. The other deck is only the green bamboo suite (Ryuiso), hence the game being called all Green. The other Mahjong suites and tiles, such as Dragons, are not represented.&#10;&#10;As in Mahjong, players repeatedly draw a card from the deck and discard one from their hand, trying to build a scoring combination from the five cards they hold after drawing. The combinations in All Green are simply a pair (the Head), and either a Run (Shuntsu) or a Meld.&#10;&#10;Based upon the value of the winning hand, players discard their points cards accordingly. The first player to get down to zero wins, or the player with the fewest points after two rounds.&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;&#10;From the Tenbo points deck, players get a 10P, two 5P, and five 1P cards, giving a total of 25 points.&#10;&#10;Then, after shuffling the bamboo deck well, players are dealt four hand cards each. The remainder are placed face down as a draw deck. Play goes clockwise, with each player taking turns to draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand.&#10;&#10;Once a player has a Pair and a Run or a Meld, they call and score. Then they discard Tenbo cards for the score. Players reshuffle the bamboo deck and play another round, until one players gets to zero points. More usually, play continues until everyone has lead twice, at which point the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#227;&#130;&#189;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#143;&#227;&#131;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#186;&#187;&#233;&#155;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;5&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#143;&#131;&#227;&#129;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#231;&#176;&#161;&#230;&#152;&#147;&#231;&#137;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#186;&#187;&#233;&#155;&#128;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#140;25&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#232;&#166;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#140;2&#229;&#145;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#170;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#140;0&#230;&#156;&#170;&#230;&#186;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;ALL GREEN is a simplified Mahjong card game. Unlike Mahjong which has 34 types of tiles, this game only has nine types of bamboo cards and green dragon cards.&#10;&#10;Each round, players are dealt four cards each. They take turns drawing one card and discarding one card until someone completes a winning hand of one pair and a set of three cards (in sequence or of a kind). The winner gains points from opponents according to the difficulty of the winning hand.&#10;&#10;Players initially have 25 points. A game consists of rounds equal to twice the number of players, but may immediately end when a player has negative points.&#10;At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

178880,,"Battle UP is a game of two halves. First, you build up your hand of cards, each card adding to your ability to defeat the other players in the combat that follows. Then, after a round of bidding and wagering on how likely you are to win, you use your cards to fight with the other players, attempting to reduce their health to zero while keeping yours. At the end of the round, the winner takes all of the tokens, and another round begins&#10;&#10;"

178882,,"Players decide either to set a time limit for the game, or to stop the game when one player has scored a pre-set number of goals (a target of 3 is recommended). Each player flicks the spinner three times and the one who 'scores' the most goals kicks off the game. The ball is placed at the centre of the board on a member of the team who will start the game. The player can move any one piece on his team (except the man who has possession) at the start of each turn, one or two sections in any direction on the board, to 'cover' the ball. Then he uses the spinner and follows the instructions, moving towards his opponents goal. The goalkeeper cannot move out of his box (which consists of six sections).&#10;&#10;"
