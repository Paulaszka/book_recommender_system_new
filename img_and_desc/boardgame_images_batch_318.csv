Legends is an 'eye-in-the-sky' game, the user is 'looking down' on the track with no more involvement than rolling the dice, consulting the Charts and keeping the Race Control Sheet up-dated. A few years ago Legends could not have been published, the demand was all for 'involvement' games, where the user's input had a definite effect on the outcome. The Sport of Kings, with its many small decisions all affecting the final outcome, is typical of that genre.&#10;&#10;The brief for Legends was for a non-involvement ATG simulation with races playable in 10-12 minutes, accurate as far as any mixed-era simulation can be, providing enough detail and stats. (split and final times) to keep the hard-core replay gamer happy and with a system that needed a minimum of book-keeping. With a simple but effective Track Display, one hundred ATG athletes who will run their races in the way they usually ran them in real life (but with ability to change race 'plans' if you wish) with times geared to 2007 standards, pace-makers, 'fast' and normal tracks, weather effects, race 'quality' effects and fitness levels.&#10;&#10;Legends will be an ideal vehicle for solo campaigns, enough 'going on' to keep the interest at a high level, fun to run races, and the chance to run a full season incorporating Grand Prix meetings, Olympics (or World Championships), world-record attempts and with a few minor meetings flung in to keep the mix flexible.&#10;&#10;--description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

Players roll dice for initiative every turn, but units are able to react to enemy forces out of sequence.&#10;&#10;Units have 3 or 4 statistics, the most important of which is VBU, a combination of unit strength and morale.&#10;&#10;Combat is fast and simple. Units roll dice equivalent to their VBU in combat, with various modifiers giving bonuses to the number of dice thrown. Any score of '6' or double '5' score a hit. There is some record keeping required, as unit hits cause a reduction in VBU. When VBU is reduced to 0, the unit routs and is removed from the table.&#10;&#10;Armies are points based, with average armies ranging between 300-500 points. There are 15 army lists detailed in the original rules, usually in 'matched pairs'. These include Alexander's Macedonians &amp; Later Achaemedian Persians, 2nd Punic War Romans &amp; Carthaginians, Gauls &amp; Caesar's Romans, Crusaders &amp; Saladin's Army, and French &amp; English armies from the 100 Years War.&#10;&#10;"

Each deck contains 52 cards and 2 &quot;jokers&quot;, but instead of typical front and back faces, each side has multiple card faces printed on it. For this Texas Hold'em deck, the fronts show 2 card faces, and the backs show 3 card faces.&#10;&#10;The front of each card represents your two hole cards, and their value relative to other starting hands. There are also example flops labeled &quot;Weak&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Great&quot;, and &quot;The Nuts&quot;, and their value relative to other possible flops. Text descriptions include a standard name and a popular nickname for the hole cards, and the common slang for your made hands and draws.&#10;&#10;The back of each card represents three cards that would be a great flop for the starting hand on the front. The idea is that without looking at the front of the card, you can deduce a range of hole cards that might be on the front just by looking at the flop cards on the back. Turn and River cards are displayed by placing one card under another so that only one new card face is showing.&#10;&#10;This connection between the cards on the front and back lets you play and learn the game by yourself, or practice your hand reading skills in a game with others. Key points of the system are: starting hands and their values before and after the flop, learning the lingo that the professionals use to describe their hands, and good practice spotting bad beats, missed draws, pure bluffs, and the stone cold nuts.&#10;&#10;Game variations you can play with this deck include: Texas Holdem, Greek Holdem, Heads-Up Holdem Solitaire, Multi-Way Holdem Solitaire, Holdem Flash Cards, and Blind Man's Bluff.&#10;&#10;"
