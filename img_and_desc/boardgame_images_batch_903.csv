By placing cards in front of you, you form cities which consist of temples, houses, and fountains.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are 72 cards, each of which has six terrain squares. At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 15 terrain cards. They then shuffle their cards to form their deck.&#10;&#10;Each round, they simultaneously draw two cards from their deck. They then choose one and place it in front of themselves, and place the other on top of another player's deck face-up. This process is done in real time.&#10;&#10;When you place your card in front of you, you must partially overlap it on an existing card. Both of overlapped squares must have the same terrain.&#10;&#10;If at least one temple, houses, and fountain are surrounded by the forest, they form a city, earning you victory points at end of game depending on the size of the city. Fountains score 3pts each. Temples and houses score more points the more they appear in the city. For each macaw you can see in your forest, you score 1pt at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;As the game nears the end, you might place a card with no chance to score. In that case, you don't place it but turn it over instead for 2 pts. However, cards that have been placed cannot be moved or retrieved to score.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the highest scorer wins the game.

Each player draws seven cards from the rest of the deck. The player whose turn it is looks for a pair. If there is on in their hand, easy points, lay them down in front of you. If they have a card in their hand that matches a card the table, they must let the parrot fly down to its mate. Hold the card at least a foot above the table, flip it up and try to get it to land, face up, touching its match. If it does, pick up it and add it to your collected pairs. If not, place it in the discard pile, draw a card, and hope you&rsquo;ll do better the next try.&#10;&#10;Simply Picking Pairs&#10;&#10;Another way to play Parrot Pair-it is the Old Maid method, where players hold a hand of seven cards and either ask if an opponent has a card needed to make a pair, or they may physically remove a card from an opponent&rsquo;s hand. Lay any pairs down to be counted later.&#10;&#10;Scoring&#10;&#10;Cards have a number scale across the bottom that rises from left to right. Some parrots species will only have one pair, while others may have up to five. If a player, for example, has one pair of macaws, which is a five-pair set, it may be worth only five points. But if the player has four of the five macaw pairs, they would have 25 points, and if they have all five, fifty points. Winning the game is when one person reaches a predetermined score, or when all the parrots have been paired with the person with the highest score winning.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

But that doesn't matter to you, as you are not a god. You are a champion of your race, and your god has told you of a great relic that will provide you with immeasurable power to overcome your foes. You must gather your most fierce forces to make the journey because your enemies have the same destiny.&#10;&#10;Divinities Boon: Primordium, pits fantasy races against each other in a battle to a magical relic. Champions command forces as they move forward on the player&rsquo;s game board. Attack your opponent&rsquo;s forces with melee, ranged or siege assaults to move your champion forward, or your enemy backward. Once your champion reaches the Boon, they must fight to retain control of it for three rounds. But victory is fleeting, for the other gods have the power to remove the boon and give their favored champion another chance for greatness.&#10;&#10;Players take turns by playing one or two minions, whose MELEE, RANGED, and SIEGE stats combine. If they beat the opposing player&rsquo;s minions in any of the three attacks, that champion is moved forward a number based on the cards played (attack and ranged), or the opposing champion is moved backward (siege). Champions add powerful bonuses to the minion's attacks and defenses. Boon cards may also be played to give an added edge.&#10;&#10;Once the champion reaches the final destination, they must maintain control of the relic for three, non-consecutive rounds. The winner returns to their homeland with the favor of their god until they take it away to play their game again.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
