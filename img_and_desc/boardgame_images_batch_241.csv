Everybody will immediately try to find a suitable word. When enough words have been found will Meggie, the heroine of the story, move towards goal; if not will Capricorn move forwards. Only if Meggie manage to reach goal first will the gamers win the game!&#10;&#10;The game is based upon the highly succesful children's book &quot;Inkheart&quot; by Cornelia Funke. The novel is about the power of the word, and game designer Klaus Teuber of &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; fame have captured the enthralling and tantalizing atmosphere of the struggle of young Meggy and her father Moe on one side against the evil Capricorn and his henchmen on the other.&#10;&#10;Moe has the fantastic ability to read characters out of a story and into life. By this he brought Capricorn, the super-villain, into our world, who strifes to get all of his evil henchmen out of his book to help him with his bad deeds. But for this, he requires Moes services...&#10;&#10;The trilogy has captivated children all over the world, and a major movie was released in March 2008.&#10;So hopefully will we soon see an English language edition of this game.&#10;&#10;This is a game in the Kosmos line of literature-based games.&#10;&#10;"

27718,,"Swim Quest was conceived as a board game that could be incorporated into swimming practices. It is designed to be constructed from waterproof materials, including a dry-erase board for keeping score. A spinner governs how many spaces the players move their pieces around a conventional track. The pieces are in thematic shapes: diver, freestyle, stopwatch, and pair of fins. Spaces on the board contain instructions for swimming activities, to be performed by the player who lands on the space (e.g., &quot;4 laps, freestyle&quot;). Some spaces have other instructions, such as &quot;Go back 1 space&quot; or &quot;Do 20 crunches.&quot; Swim Quest has been awarded US Patent number 7125016B1.&#10;&#10;"

Each player has a nifty miniature figurine to move around the track. Dice-rolls move the figurines and players earn or spend money according to where they land. Instead of properties, players land on adventures which they can 'purchase' and other players landing there in future have to pay the owner of the adventure.

The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in Reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.&#10;&#10;The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.&#10;&#10;Playing time for Blackshirthas averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 6 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.&#10;&#10;Each game of Blackshirt includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemick&rsquo;s colorful cut-and-paste counters, two small decks of cards, and a snappy Pascal da Silva map (in one piece!)&quot;&#10;&#10;Available in English or French&#10;1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)&#10;1 A3 map of Lybia and Egypt - 20 colored Opportunity Cards - 140 counters (NATO Symbols) -&#10;The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva&#10;&#10;Uses the Same System As:&#10;&#10;    Bitter Victory&#10;&#10;&#10;Reimplimented by: Blood & Sand published by Worthington Games&#10;&#10;"
