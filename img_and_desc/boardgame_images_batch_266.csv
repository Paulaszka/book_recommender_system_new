Robots hold up to four VP tiles worth 1-3 VPs each. &ldquo;The longer the robots are around, the more VP they&rsquo;ll earn&mdash;but the VPs for a robot may be lost if the robot is defeated or destroyed by another robot.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;During set-up, seven parts tiles are included for each player, and the game ends when a players takes the final tile. Adds Sisk, &ldquo;With more players, there&rsquo;s more risk of a more powerful robot being targeted by everyone else, so players must be careful when building. A very powerful robot will earn the most VPs, but will be more at risk of being destroyed. Players become more interested in trying to slip a less powerful robot under the radar of other players and build VPs slowly.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;"

And there are copyists, who will dispute the glory you've earned for your monuments...&#10;&#10;The game shows monument cards with 12 types of ancient monuments like the Pyramids or the Colosseum (9 per type). The game is played in turns and usually you take a &quot;monument turn,&quot; consisting of 3 actions allowing you to collect cards, to build monuments, and to expand your existing monuments. For example, it takes you one action per card to draw it either from the draw pile or the 3 faceup cards near it.&#10;&#10;If you have some cards showing the same monument, you can use another action to erect this monument in your display. In case you are the first one to build this type of monument, you only need two cards - the second player building this same type of monument must have at least 3 cards. And no third player is allowed to build the same monument! Thus, playing your cards early makes it easier for you to erect the monument. But it saves you actions to collect some cards before displaying it, because regardless of the number of cards used, erecting one monument only counts as one single action.&#10;&#10;Your monuments will receive their eternal fame only, if they are part of history. Each player has 2 (in a 3 player game: 3) historian tokens. In a historian turn, you have no monument action, but only write a history about all of your OPPONENTS' monuments (not your own ones!). Monuments get famous, and the owners receive victory points at the end of the game - the more often your monuments are in such histories, the more points you get. However, only interesting monuments of at least two cards are considered for a history, and by writing a history, the historian takes one card away (removes it from the game)! Thus the monument could be cut down to only one card during the game and will be not interesting to later historians any more. Why should I write a history and make the monuments of my opponents more worthy? If you do not use all of your historian tokens, you will be punished with 12 negative points at the end of the game! And you get additional victory points in the case that you write histories with a lot of monuments mentioned in it.&#10;&#10;You should make your monuments interesting to historians again. During a monument turn, you may use one action (regardless of the number of cards played at the same time) to add cards to a monument that you have already erected.&#10;&#10;In MONUMENTS, timing is important, and you have to decide what the best move to do now is: Should I wait for another Petra card, or shall I display the Petra Monument this turn? Is it advisable to make a historian turn now or is it better to choose a monument turn and draw the faceup cards, which I really need - taking the risk that I cannot write a history next turn and wind up getting negative points!&#10;&#10;Finally, you have to consider that you are not sure about the victory points for your monuments. The points are related to the monument during the game, and if the Akropolis monument is worth 12 Points for example, you will only get 4 points if another player manages to erect an Akropolis monument that is greater than yours. This damn copyist will not only receive all your bad wishes, but 8 of the 12 Akropolis Victory Points - even in the case that his monument was not part of any history. Somehow you will feel that all the glory should be given to you alone!&#10;&#10;"

The object of the game is to place tiles on the board, with the coordinates determined by rolling two dice (with opportunities for two re-rolls). When a square of four tiles is on the board, it is considered completed and is turned over to show an 'object worth seeing'. Rolling doubles allows one to roll a special die, which could result in an extra turn, being allowed to place two tiles anywhere on the board, or missing the next turn.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has completed five objects worth seeing. Scoring points is based on where the tiles in completed objects lie. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

Some of these 3D chess variations created new chess pieces while other 3D rules imposed mandatory or unusual moves. In addition, many of these &quot;rules&quot; were generally incomplete causing inconsistent interpretations. None of these game variations offered a truly playable chess game.&#10;&#10;Because of the lack of playable rules, the Millennium 3D Chess rules were written with the objective of extending the traditional chess game into a multilevel environment without distorting the basic game. To this end, Millennium 3D Chess has not &quot;created&quot; new chess rules, but instead extended the traditional rules to allow for multi-board play. Other than the concept of moving between chess boards (levels), all traditional two (2D) chess rules apply.&#10;&#10;"
