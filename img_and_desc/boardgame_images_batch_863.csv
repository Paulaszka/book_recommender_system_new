(2015) card game from renowned designer Alexander Pfister. In this board game adaption of the successful card game, 1 to 4 players from 12 and up compete in different chapters to experience the world of the Longsdale kingdom once again. The story of Expedition to Newdale starts about five years after the events from Oh my Goods! Escape to Canyon Brook, but you don&rsquo;t need to know the prequels at all. Each chapter of the game lasts about 90 minutes which adds up to around 12 hours of exciting campaign gameplay. And when you found your favorite chapter while playing the campaign, you can always come back and play it again to have even more fun!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game you have your personal board, a coal mine as your start building and 5 hand cards. Depending on which chapter you are playing, the appropriate game board sits in the middle of the table. Each round is divided into 5 phases which are played in order (or partially parallel, once you become more familiar with the game). In phase 1, a new event is revealed which usually alters the course of play in this round slightly (e. g., by introducing new buildings). Additionally the event card shows a fixed amount of workers which are available this round. An information which is much appreciated, as you have to place your action markers in phase 2. The latter are numbered 1 &mdash; 4 which is important for phase 4 and means that you need to plan ahead. But first phase 3: in this phase, more workers are drawn from a bag and get added to the others. This means that productions which would have been impossible before (because workers were missing) are now easily done. Pushing your luck might be beneficial! Phase 4 is the opposite to phase 2. Instead of placing your workers, you resolve their chosen action in order of their numbers. We hope you had a backup plan in place if your desired workers were not drawn in phase 3, because this can trigger an unpleasant chain of events! Not enough workers could mean that a production does not happen, which then means that you might not have enough money to build the building with your second action marker. Oh, and your third marker was planned to directly produce in the newly built building? Well, where there is no building, there&rsquo;s no place to produce in, right? Clearly: planning ahead, a little luck and good alternatives are the way to success. In Phase 5, all players can either use a free building action or draw new hand cards. The last phase is used to resolve all buildings which do not need workers, e. g., an automatic coal production or a building which offers the conversion of a certain good to victory points. Afterwards the next round starts, of which you play a total of seven. A final scoring at the end of round seven will then show if you win or lose.&#10;&#10;"

In Ark of Atlantis, the turn order is constantly changing depending on where a player&rsquo;s time track marker is positioned on the time track. If a player&rsquo;s marker lands on or passes over an event space the player draws an event card and then resolves it by flipping over an island tile. The second time an island tile would be flipped it is removed from the game. The game ends once all island tiles have been removed.

It&rsquo;s free to download.&#10;&#10;This very early version is in black-and-white with very simple graphics.&#10;&#10;The Dark features a classic group of adventurers exploring a dungeon. One player lays out the dungeon cards, while the others control the adventurers. Adventurers leave torches to light the way through the dungeon as they explore, and for each torch placed the character player gains a point. Roles are then rotated, and scores compared to determine the victor!&#10;&#10;This set contains:&#10;1 double sided dungeon entrance card.&#10;6 adventurer cards, each with their own deck of 7 cards.&#10;47 dungeon master cards, including 4 instant cards.&#10;1 deck box.&#10;&#10;The Adventurers:&#10;Guard: Loves a scrap. Good at the stabby-stabby. No so good at the hygiene. Scared of water, so cannot cross the many and varied puddles dotted around the dungeon.&#10;&#10;Librarian: Great at magic. constantly coughs up warp-points. Carries a lot of books around, and is scared they&rsquo;ll get destroyed by the bonfires in the dungeon, so cannot cross doorways blocked by fire.&#10;&#10;Miner: Intent on ignoring the normal passageways of the dungeon and blasting new tunnels through the place. Spends most of his time underground so is terrified of heights, and cannot cross the cracks in the floor.&#10;&#10;Vampire: Here for a long time, not for a good time. Hated by the other adventurers, but kind of useful. Can&rsquo;t go through doorways without being invited and there&rsquo;s no one around to invite them.&#10;Aversion to silver.&#10;&#10;Explorer: Jack-of-all-trades kinda person. Bit of a coward. Rubbish at fighting monsters.&#10;&#10;Zombie: Barely alive. Probably still braindead. Rarely does anything, but oh so great at this adventuring business when they wake up and start smashing heads together.&#10;&#10;The Decks:&#10;Instants: Most adventurer deck cards and some dungeon master cards are Instants. Reveal the card, do what it says, then discard the card. Simples. Instants only affect cards in play, not cards in the decks.&#10;&#10;Permanents: These cards stay on the table until the end of the game or until another card causes them to be discarded.&#10;&#10;Dungeon cards: These make up the dungeon for your adventurers to explore. They&rsquo;re played dark side up with the nasty stuff on. To win the game the character player needs to flip these cards over to their light side, revealing nicer stuff.&#10;&#10;&ldquo;Misplaced&rdquo; cards: The dungeon deck contains 4 instant cards. Some of the adventurer decks contain cards that can be played as part of the dungeon as if the character player were the dungeon master.&#10;&#10;When placing cards that form part of the dungeon:&#10;&bull; Cards must be played adjacent to another dungeon card forming a grid. Cards should meet along the full length of a long or short&#10;side of the card.&#10;&bull; Cards may not be placed corner-to-corner.&#10;&bull; Cards may be rotated 180 degrees, but not 90 degrees, they must always be in &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; orientation, not landscape.&#10;&bull; Cards can be placed in a way that rubble or other obstacles make the dungeon impassable in the next turn, but cards cannot be entirely blocked by rubble.&#10;&bull; Cards cannot be placed further back than the dungeon entrance, otherwise the table gets very messy very quickly.&#10;&#10;Reach:&#10;At many points during the game you&rsquo;ll need to check if an adventure can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; a monster or chest. Checking this is simple, just draw a line with your finger through the dungeon from the entrance card to the monster or chest in question. If you&rsquo;re not blocked by items that your adventurer is afraid of, or by more doors than you have keys, your character can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; the monster or chest in question.&#10;&#10;The Adventurers will be blocked by:&#10;Rubble: Impassable. Find another way around.&#10;Locked doors: Can only be opened with a key.&#10;Kind of like locked doors in real life. Vampires have trouble with these.&#10;Puddles: Easy to walk through, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.&#10;Bonfires: Easy to jump over, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.&#10;Cracks in the floor: Easy to jump over, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.&#10;Open Passage Ways: All characters can freely pass between rooms with open passage ways.&#10;&#10;In the dungeon you might find such varied items as:&#10;Monsters: The dream-team for any dungeon master. They look different but all do the same thing: cause the character player to lose cards until the monster is defeated. Don&rsquo;t hate the monster; hate the game.&#10;Wooden chests: Like silver chests, only made of wood.&#10;Silver chests: Like wooden chests only made of silver. Vampires really don&rsquo;t like silver that much, so can&rsquo;t travel through rooms containing silver chests.&#10;Warp Points: Any adventurer can travel from any warp point to any other warp point.&#10;Mine Shafts: Any adventure can travel from any mine shaft to any other mine shaft.&#10;Keys: For opening doors. All doors in the dungeon can be opened with any key, but you need as many keys as doors you want to open on a single character route. For example, if in order to reach a monster, the Guard needs to travel through 3 doors, you need 3 keys. No, you can&rsquo;t just take the key with you along the way&#10;because&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know why not. But that&rsquo;s not how the game works, okay?&#10;Bombs: Classic little bomb type bombs. When a bomb is revealed, the dungeon master can instantly discard a card from the top of any adventurer deck that can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; the bomb. If the bomb is on an instant the dungeon master can pick any adventurer deck.&#10;Torches: This is how you win the game. As dungeon cards are flipped, torches will appear. The more torches, the higher your score.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

Players then choose one from their hand each turn, and place it face down in front of themselves.  All of those cards are then simultaneously revealed. Typically, the player who chose the card with the highest value will score a point. However, duplicate cards cancel each other, '1' beats a '5', and '0' can be any value between 0-5. After all six cards have been played once, each player picks up their entire hand and play another set of turns.&#10;&#10;The game ends one of two ways: The first player to score 9 points immediately wins, or after 3 complete sets.  In the latter case, the player with the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;&#230;&#150;&#135;&#230;&#136;&#191;&#229;&#133;&#183;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#162;&#227;&#131;&#129;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;6&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#163;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#229;&#142;&#159;&#229;&#137;&#135;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#164;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#239;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#239;&#188;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#10;&#239;&#188;&#145;&#239;&#189;&#158;5&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#148;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#231;&#149;&#165;&#231;&#154;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#144;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;"

The game allows solitaire play.&#10;&#10;In this game, there are 55 cards numbered 1-10, and the number on the card equals to the number of that card in the game. Of these 55 cards, the deck is shuffled and thirty-five cards are placed on the table. Players take turns playing cards from their hand to remove cards from the table.&#10;&#10;Before the game starts, the players make a tableau of 35 cards, in overlapping skewed rows. Some are face up, some are face-down. (Place five of them in the first row. Then place next five cards in the second row, covering half of the previous row, sliding half of the card length rightward. Continue placing until the seventh row is made. By doing so, only the bottom (seventh) row is fully visible, and most of the cards are partially hidden by two cards of the next row.)&#10;&#10;During your turn, you play a card from your hand to remove a fully visible card of the same value. Alternatively, you play two cards from your hand to remove a fully visible card whose value equals to the sum or difference of your two cards.&#10;&#10;After you remove a card from the table, new cards can be fully visible. If there is a pair of fully visible cards of the same value, they are removed immediately. Continue this chain reaction until no pair is made.&#10;&#10;When you can't remove any card by playing from your hand, you must spend a joker to remove any one card. All players lose the game if five jokers are spent and still you can't remove any card.&#10;&#10;All players win the game when all cards are removed from the table.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;Rescue the people trapped in the kingdom! A co-operative card game using a total of 55 cards, from one &ldquo;1&rdquo; card to ten &ldquo;10&rdquo; cards.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn uses cards to make pairs with the cards in the center to remove them. The players are considered as the winners if all the cards in the center are removed. Although you may not talk about the numbers in your hand, you may form a strategy based on the number of cards of each type and aim for a win by communicating with your fellow players. It feels wonderful when you get a chain reaction!&#10;&#10;Aim for a high score by using techniques such as adding/subtracting the numbers of two cards from your hand.&#10;&#10;&#233;&#150;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#152;&#232;&#190;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#142;&#139;&#229;&#155;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#128;&#133;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#149;&#145;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#128;1&#227;&#129;&#140;1&#230;&#158;&#154;&#239;&#189;&#158;10&#227;&#129;&#140;10&#230;&#158;&#154;&#232;&#168;&#136;55&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#229;&#141;&#148;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#131;&#154;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#233;&#153;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#137;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#229;&#133;&#168;&#229;&#147;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#229;&#136;&#169;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#232;&#135;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#168;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#231;&#166;&#129;&#230;&#173;&#162;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#144;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#158;&#154;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#228;&#189;&#156;&#230;&#136;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#171;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#163;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#129;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#233;&#128;&#163;&#233;&#142;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#230;&#177;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#136;&#189;&#229;&#191;&#171;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#160;&#188;&#229;&#136;&#165;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#227;&#128;&#128;&#230;&#137;&#139;&#230;&#156;&#173;&#227;&#129;&#174;2&#230;&#158;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#229;&#173;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#182;&#179;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#229;&#188;&#149;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#131;&#134;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#139;&#227;&#131;&#131;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#129;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#233;&#167;&#134;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#171;&#152;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#231;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#135;&#227;&#129;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#239;&#188;&#129;&#10;&#10;"
