In Spring, players gain a free card. In Summer, players can build for free. In Fall, players gain free resource points. And in Winter, players reduce the resource points or hurt the buildings of unprotected players.&#10;&#10;In the Construction Phase, buildings that are partially built will progress on their own. Players may also spend a resource point to help one building along. In the Action Phase, players will play Action Cards. Some cards can only be played in certain seasons or when players have completed certain buildings.

After nearly a month of fighting the British Dominion forces were in full retreat, hoping to meet with reinforcements being rushed to the theater and to regroup behind the Sittang River. Key to this goal was the successful withdrawal of the Indian 17th Division. That division had been engaged in a running fight with the Japanese 33rd (214th and 215th Regiments) and 55th (143rd Regiment) Divisions from the outset of the invasion. Both sides converged on the only major bridge over the Sittang river north of Rangoon, a railway span near the town of Sittang.  An Allied success here could potentially thwart the Japanese offensive and save Rangoon. Another victory for the Japanese could lead to the capture of that major port and even more conquests by the sons from the land of the Rising Sun.&#10;&#10;Each copy of An Unpleasant and Devastating Fight is composed of the following:&#10;&#10;One 11 by 17 inch hex map&#10;One sheet of 70 double-sided, unmounted counters&#10;8 pages of rules&#10;&#10;Infantry units are battalions, all other units are companies.

Players control the Norman, Saxon, Viking, and Scots/Welsh Factions and use Events, Commands and Special Abilities to place and move leaders and pieces on the map to control areas, gain support, and win victory.&#10;&#10;Edward the Confessor returned from exile in Normandy after decades of Viking rule in 1042 to become king of England. Magnus the Good of Norway also claimed the throne, and threatened war, but was dissuaded by the childless Edward, who promised to make him his heir. Edward gave the same promise to Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark, William of Normandy, and Harold Godwinson. When he died in 1066 four powerful warlords claimed to be his rightful heir. It would not end well.&#10;&#10;Cards are drawn from the deck one at time, with one card in play and the following card face up on top of the deck. Each Event card shows the order in which Eligible Factions may choose to resolve the Event or one of their own Commands, sometimes with one of their Special Abilities. Resolving an Event or Command makes the Faction Ineligible for the next card. Crown Events interrupt play as a King is crowned, Victory is determined, Revenue is collected, and Support is expanded.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"
