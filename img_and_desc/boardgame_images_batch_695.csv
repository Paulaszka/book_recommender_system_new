The advanced version is a great method of playing cross-era teams to see who was truly better.&#10;&#10;You will need 2 D10, not included with the game.  You use the d10 rolls to determine which players on a given team will play in a game and what his potential scoring total is.

The offensive player chooses his play and then picks a card. Each card lists a result for all possible plays. The player checks his chosen play and applies the result by moving a football marker on a football field board. Downs, first downs and scoring work as they do in American football. Kicks (kickoffs and punts) are resolved by drawing one card for the kick distance and another for the return distance. When a play results in a penalty, interception or too-short field goal, another card is drawn to show the result. When all the cards in the stack are used up, a quarter ends. The deck is then shuffled and the next quarter begins. The second half (or third quarter) begins with a kickoff. As in a typical football game, the player with the most points after four quarters wins.&#10;&#10;"

187929,,"Le zug is played on the dark squares of a 17x17 board (the four edge squares must be dark). A game starts with 12 pieces per player. Nine pieces of each color are placed on the first and the last row. In the first move (each player's first turn) the players put their three remaining pieces on the row next to their other pieces in any order they want them.&#10; After that players move at their turn one of their pieces diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. Players also can jump over their own pieces or over those of their opponent (even combining both colors) similar to Halma but only diagonally forward. However, they don't have to jump, if they don't want to, and they can stop a jumping move anywhere, not making the largest jump possible. After the last jump they are allowed to move the piece, which did the jump, one square diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. Again, this is not mandatory. No pieces are ever captured and the jumped pieces remain untouched.&#10;&#10;The first four rows of each player are called their &quot;railway station&quot; (&quot;gare&quot; in French; &quot;Bahnhof&quot; in German). Players are not permitted to enter their opponent's railway station, before they have vaca&shy;ted their own one. After a player has entered all of his pieces into the opponent's railway station, he is allowed to move or jump backward to reach the final goal position, but only as long as all of his pieces remain in the opponent's railway station.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to place nine pieces on the last row and the remaining three pieces anywhere on the penultimate row, that is to recreate a valid start position on the opponent's side of the board.&#10;&#10;The name of the game is French and German mixed together (&quot;le&quot; is the masculine French article; &quot;zug&quot; means train in German). The game is meant to celebrate friendship between the French and the German peoples after centuries of wars fought between them. It is related to Halma and Salta. Le zug was first described in the book &quot;Le livre de tous les jeux&quot; (Edition Solar), which was published in France on January 1, 1989.&#10;&#10;"

After the capture the king becomes a normal piece again unless it ends its turn on the opponent's back row. The game stops if a player cannot make a move. The winner is the player who has got more pieces of either color in the opponent's half of the board.

To win the game, sink all enemy ships, or be the first to earn 7 gold. But watch out for the volcano. If your opponent&rsquo;s prayers to the volcano gods are successful, lava could engulf your fleet.&#10;&#10;Volcano Cove is a beautiful 2-player game that packs a large punch. Games last 10-15 minutes while providing drama and strategic decisions around every turn. Since there are multiple paths to victory, you&rsquo;ll need to watch your opponent carefully and look for weaknesses you can exploit.&#10;&#10;Both players share a zero-sum Gold Track. When you earn 1 gold your opponent loses 1 gold, and vice versa. This means when you buy extra ships or movement, you are giving your opponent gold in exchange for the advantage. You earn gold by sinking enemy ships, occupying gold mine spaces, having 3 Battle Coins at the end of your turn, and by praying to the volcano gods and successfully causing an eruption.&#10;&#10;You start your turn by building your fleet, sailing, and declaring any battles you&rsquo;d like. When fighting, your Battle Strength is equal to the number of coins that make up your ship (ships can be built up to 3 coins high) plus any Battle Coins you commit. Three Battle Coins float between both players throughout the game. If you commit a Battle Coin to a battle, you have a higher Battle Strength for the current battle, but you must pass any committed Battle Coins to your opponent.&#10;&#10;After the Battle Phase, your opponent decides if he or she wants to pray to the volcano gods. If your opponent prays, he or she shakes 3 Prayer Coins. The number of heads shaken moves the Volcano Track marker, which can cause an eruption. Ships within the Lava Danger Zone when the volcano erupts take damage depending on the severity of the eruption. After the Pray Phase, you end you turn by earning gold from any gold mine spaces you still occupy. Then play passes to the next player.&#10;&#10;To create your free print-and-play copy of Volcano Cove, print the board and rules at VolcanoCove.com and find 10 pennies, 10 nickels, 5 dimes, and 3 quarters.

They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;The Deluxe edition contains the basic Taluva game at increased size, as well as the following new expansions:&#10;&#10;     Ship expansion: A new wooden piece, which can be placed in lagoons, adjacent to settlements&#10;     2-Hex tiles expansion&#10;&#10;&#10;Some of the Deluxe editions also contain the deluxe game board and three-volcano start tile.&#10;&#10;"
