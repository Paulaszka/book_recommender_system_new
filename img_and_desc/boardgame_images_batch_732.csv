The East India Company has just had its monopoly of trade revoked by an official act of Parliament. You, and others like you, see a golden opportunity for profit in China.

There is real money to be made here and you intend to make it.&#10;&#10;An Infamous Traffic is a brutal economic board game for two to five souls brave enough to conduct the opium trade in the fracturing political landscape of 19th century Qing China. Initially, you will need to rely on smugglers in order to get your products into the interior, but, if Parliament can be swayed, perhaps an open war can make the trade more secure. At the same time, you&rsquo;ll want to be careful. If British aggression goes unchecked, the region may become a failed state, which could jeopardize your hard fought gains.&#10;&#10;Of course, the massive wealth you&rsquo;ll earn won&rsquo;t be enough.

The market shifts after each robot is sold, so keeping track of what your opponents are doing and how they will affect the game is important.&#10;&#10;"

The villagers don't know who the werewolves are, and the werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the villagers one at a time. A moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game. The game takes place over a series of days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns if one player is a werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the villagers or all the werewolves are eliminated.&#10;&#10;Ultimate Werewolf Legacy uses gameplay similar to Ultimate Werewolf, but you no longer have single standalone games as players and the village itself have attributes that are retained between games, with events that take place in the first games having effects that ripple through remaining games.

Players are each given a public family card in addition to their secret role card, and they team up with the other members of their family to work together...unless one or more of their family members is secretly working against them.&#10;&#10;As for the village, there are multiple paths that the game may take, and as a result the experience you have playing through the entire game will differ from someone else who is playing with another set of people. This also allows players to play through the campaign multiple times, with a different set of roles, rules, and environments each time.&#10;&#10;At the center of Ultimate Werewolf Legacy is an oversized, 80+ page diary, that walks the game moderator through every session. The diary has been designed so that players with no previous Werewolf playing experience can both play and moderate. The diary is structured into five distinct chapters with three game sessions in each chapter, as well as an introductory preface game session. Players can jump in and out for individual sessions, but ideally they'll play all the sessions in a chapter. Each chapter can be played in a single evening. At the end of the sixteen-game session campaign, the diary will be a record of exactly what happened in your village, and who was ultimately responsible for what it became over time.&#10;&#10;Replay packs that contain a new diary and an additional set of family cards will be sold separately, allowing players to play through the entire campaign again.&#10;&#10;"

It is said that it &quot;survived its own death&quot;, and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.&#10;&#10;In Warsaw: City of Ruins, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;In more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.&#10;     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.&#10;&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3&times;4 or 4&times;3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.&#10;&#10;During the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.&#10;&#10;"

All clues indicate that the mansion is where nefarious Cultists are attempting to bring their dark god into this world. The group will investigate clues in and around the mansion, hopefully uncovering enough information that they can stop the looming threat. Little do they know that some of those Cultists are hidden among them. If the Cultists can hinder the Investigators enough, an avatar of the Old One will manifest and destroy the world as we know it.&#10; The Intrigue Edition requires from 5 to 8 players. Investigators and Cultists go on a series of Investigations on the mansion or its grounds. Over 10 Investigations, try to deduce who are the hidden Cultists &ndash; or hide your identity as one. In the end, the side with the most points from successful Investigations wins.&#10;&#10;"

Do you want to know who is pulling the strings behind global decisions? Then It's Just A Theory is the game for you. In this fast-paced, storytelling card game players take on the role of conspiracy theorists competing against each other to come up with the greatest and most entertaining conspiracy theories.&#10;&#10;During the game players create a conspiracy theory together, using &lsquo;fact&rsquo; cards that show concepts or objects which can be used to form conspiracy theories. One player is the lead conspiracy theorist who will start creating a theory using their cards. The lead conspiracy theorist will try to guide the theory towards an ending on one of their propaganda cards. However to do this they will have to compete against every other conspiracy theorist at the table, who wishes to highjack their theory and explain their own deluded ideas. Other players hijack a theory by trying to use their cards to interrupt and successfully challenge the theory. The winner of a round is the player who plays their propaganda card ending the theory. Points are scored by finishing theories and more points are awarded by playing more cards. The winner is the conspiracy theorist who has the most points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;So don your tinfoil hat, open your third eye and prepare to discover truths you did not know about the world, and remember; It&rsquo;s Just A Theory.&#10;&#10;"

Holes designed to fit the balls are cut into the cardboard target at various points.&#10;&#10;These include a 50 point bulls-eye and four holes in each of three surrounding rings (30,20,10), plus half a dozen 10 holes and four diamonds worth 5 outside the main target. There is a &quot;No Score&quot; indented section in front of the target, where balls count for zero but may be re-shot. A ball that misses the box counts zero and is out of play.&#10;&#10;Players take turns shooting the three balls, and the one with the highest total score after four rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;"
