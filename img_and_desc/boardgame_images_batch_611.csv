Players select their hero, their special ability, and a boss that they will fight at the end of the game. Then players navigate the dungeon, fighting any monsters in their way, collecting treasure, and dealing with any events that might crop up along the way until the boss fight is triggered.&#10;&#10;bCP is a co-op game with a competitive element. Players will find it difficult to navigate the dungeon alone but will be collecting treasures of varying value along the way, the choice on whether to share these with their party or hoard them for their own benefit at the end of the game is theirs alone. The person with the highest value of treasure when the boss is defeated or the heroes die at the hands of the boss is the winner.&#10;&#10;bCP uses custom dice to resolve combat, trigger special abilities, and seed the dungeon. The game is played out through a series of rounds in which the players each take a turn consisting of two actions then the monsters take a turn fending off the heroes advances. This continues until the boss fight is triggered by a card located in the monster deck, at which time all heroes are warped to the room that the boss appears and fight desperately to best the boss of the dungeon.&#10;&#10;With the varying player abilities and the random dungeon seeds bCP will not play the same way twice. Unlike other dungeon crawlers, bCP will not require a DM to guide the party along the way.&#10;&#10;"

Rather than using social deduction, players will have to carefully watch to see which cards are drafted and how they are played to decipher friend from foe. Players may never willingly show their role to another player, but may say whatever they want about it, even the truth if necessary. The game is played over the course of several rounds and can usually be finished in less than 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;Each round has 3 phases:&#10;&#10;1. Deal Cards - Roles and tradecraft cards will be shuffled and dealt randomly.  &#10;2. Choose Cards - Players will pass a portion of their cards to the left 3 times to draft the cards they want.  &#10;3. Play Cards - Cards are then executed in descending order, information flows, and bullets fly.&#10;&#10;Scoring is based on the side winning the round (1 point) and completing a public or secret missions (usually 1 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;"

Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves.&#10;&#10;In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards.&#10;&#10;The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand.&#10;&#10;The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players.&#10;&#10;If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points wins!&#10;&#10;"

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements from South Walton, a city in Florida, USA.&#10;&#10;"

You may ship it to a stranger, drop it down a chimney, or simply toss it over the neighbor's fence... anything! Just make sure you're not holding it when it blows!&#10;&#10;Each round of Kaboom! is divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;1. Preparation&#10;&#10;Players draw cards and lay TRAPS, by placing cards from their hand face-down on the table.When another player attempts to pass you the bomb, they will likely set off one of your traps in the process.&#10;&#10;2. Passing&#10;&#10;The player with the bomb passes the bomb by placing it before one of the other players' traps.  The trap is revealed and the instructions on the card are followed.  The bomb is likely to pass to several players during this phase.  Whoever is holding the bomb at the end of the phase panics!&#10;&#10;3. Panicking!&#10;&#10;When a player panics, he/she must reveal the top card from the draw pile and suffer the consequences listed in the bottom right corner of the card.  This may include discarding cards, passing cards to other players, or exploding!  When a player explodes, they lose and are removed from the game.&#10;&#10;The remaining players start a new round, pass around a new bomb, and establish additional losers.  Of course, the last man standing may be thought of as the &quot;winner.&quot;  But it goes against the spirit of the game.&#10;&#10;"

Each player has one pawn that they will use to build and claim stacks as well as block their opponent from doing the same. The goal is to be the first player to claim 4 three-high stacks or be the player with the most stacks when no further moves can be made.&#10;&#10;The rules of Stac are quite simple:&#10;&#10;1) On your turn, move your pawn horizontally or vertically, like a rook in Chess.&#10;&#10;2) Choose whether or not you want to carry a token with you to build a stack.&#10;&#10;3) If you carry a token to a stack of two tokens, you claim that stack.&#10;&#10;4) Claim 4 three-high stacks to win.&#10;&#10;Sounds easy, right? Well it would be if your opponent wasn't racing to do the exact same thing. For some reason, your opponent wants to win so they'll use their pawn to block your moves and carry tokens across the board to create and claim stacks too.&#10;&#10;Awards:&#10;2014 2 Player Print and Play Best Abstract Game&#10;2014 2 Player Print and Play Best Language-Independent Game - 2nd Place&#10;&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net (real time or turn based, AI option)&#10;     AiAi (AI only)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;"
