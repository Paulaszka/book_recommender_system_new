With other players both sides can be used.&#10;&#10;The cards are shuffled and divided into three stacks. Players turn over the top card from each of the stacks. Players then simultaneously search for a characteristic that two of the three items shown on the cards share. A player who thinks to have found such a characteristic slaps the stop card and tells the other players his/her idea. If they accept it as correct, he/she wins the pair of cards and two new cards are turned over. If his/her idea isn't accepted, the game continues with the same three cards as before.&#10;The shared characteristic has to be something both items have (not something they both don't have), and it has to something that hasn't been mentioned in a previous round, otherwise the first player to use that characteristic wins this pair too.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all cards have been used.

Or, if the game is played in multiple rounds, being the one with the most point (one point for each time the egg lands in our own nest).&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player gets a crocodile and the nest of the same colour. The crocodiles are placed about 50 cm apart. The egg is placed in the middle, at equal distances from each of the nests.&#10;&#10;Gamplay: The starting player places his/her crocodile next to the egg, so that the tail is very close to the egg. He/she then touches the crocodile's head and turns it so that the tail hits the egg and the egg starts rolling. If the egg stops moving with the same player's colour up, he/she gets another turn and flicks again. Otherwise it's the other player's turn now.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the egg ends up in one of the nests. This player wins the game. (If players have agreed on playing multiple rounds, the game ends after the agreed-on number of rounds.)&#10;&#10;Difficulty can be adjusted by putting the nests closer together.&#10;The instructions also include suggestions for a few variants/other activities with the game materials:&#10;- Which player needs the fewest attempts to get the egg into his/her nest?&#10;- Which player can kick the egg more often with his/her own colour ending up on top?&#10;- Which player can kick the egg the furthest in one go?&#10;- Threads can be used to set a racing course.

132949,,"The Star Game is a 3-dimensional occult board game for two players. In addition to being a game, it is also used as occult sorcery with each occult initiate expected to make their own boards and pieces.&#10;&#10;There are two versions of the game, the simple and the advanced. The simple game has seven boards placed one above the other in a spiral, with the boards named after particular stars. Each board has nine black and nine white squares, making 126 squares in total over the seven boards. Each player (white and black) starts the game with three sets of nine pieces (27 pieces per player) with each piece allowed to move across a board, and up or down from board to board, in a different way. Only some types of pieces can capture other opposing pieces, and a captured piece is removed from the boards and plays no further part in the game.&#10;&#10;The seven boards are named Naos, Deneb, Rigel, Mira, Antares, Arcturus, and Sirius. At the start of the game, each player has six particular pieces on Sirius, three pieces on Arcturus, six pieces on Antares, three on Rigel, six on Deneb, three on Naos, and none on Mira. As in other board games, the players take turns to make their moves.&#10;&#10;The basic rule of play is that after a piece has been moved - whether across a board or from one board to a higher or lower board - it is transformed into another piece according to a set sequence and then can be moved according to its new designation. Another rule is that pieces can only stay on the Mira board for three moves.&#10;&#10;The basic aim of the simple form of the game is for one player to place three of their pieces on certain squares on Mira, with the type of these pieces and their placing on that board decided by both players beforehand. The first player to do this wins the game. This takes some skill and some time since not only can an opposing player capture pieces on Mira but also pieces are only allowed to stay on Mira for three moves, after which the player must move the piece. Depending on the skill of the player, to win a simple game takes from a few hours to a day or more.&#10;&#10;In the advanced Game, each board has six (minor) boards (three at each end), with there being additional pieces (more sets of nine for each player making 81 pieces per player). There are also additional rules regarding movement. In this version of The Star Game, each board is divided into three other levels so that there are four levels to each board, making a total of 308 squares over the seven main boards. Depending on the skill of the player, to win an advanced game can take several days.&#10;&#10;In both the simple and the advanced games, the pieces are usually small tetrahedrons (or small squares) marked with the particular abstract symbol (or the particular occult symbol) which is used to designate that type of piece.&#10;&#10;Complete game rules are outlined in &quot;NAOS: A Practical Guide to Modern Magick&quot;. A free software version is also available.&#10;&#10;"

Some play quickly, where you can get a final score with relative ease.  Some are more complex, giving the gamer a more 'head coach' feel.  I'd like to think that Diggin Deep Football falls somewhere in between, and is the perfect game for the Fantasy Football fan.  You can very easily take your fantasy football roster, plug it into Diggin Deep Football, and play a full game of football with full stats in about 60-90 minutes.  It adds an extra dimension to the Fantasy Football craze.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is smooth and should be easy to pick up.  Plays should normally take only one roll of the dice to resolve a play.  Before the play, the offense calls the play and the players involved.  The defense attempts to 'call' the play as well.  If they are correct, penalties go against whoever handles the ball.  If they are wrong, the play proceeds as normal with no penalty to the ball handler.  Think Tecmo Bowl from the old Nintendo days, when you called the right play on defense, you got to blitz the QB.  The better your defense 'calls' the play, the better the end result will be for the defense in Diggin Deep Football.&#10;&#10;My vision for Diggin Deep Football would be as a great fit for the casual football fan who loves fantasy football.  Anyone can play a game right out of the box and play with stock teams.  Since the game is played with cards instead of team sheets, you can mix and match players across different teams (like Fantasy Football.  The game also can cater to the more hardcore football fan.  When do you put 'Nine in the Box' against a team who relies heavily on the run, or maybe try to fool the defense by setting up a screen with your backup Tight End.  Diggin Deep Football should have something for everyone.&#10;&#10;Diggin Deep Football also has some of the aspects that have become the flagship of any Diggin Deep Sports product.  The more talented players can 'Dig Deep' in certain game situations to tilt the scales in their favor.  Imagine TRYING to play defense against a Jim Brown who is Diggin Deep.  How about trying to convert a 3rd and 12 against a Bears Line backing Core that is Diggin Deep?  The Diggin Deep methodology is not only limited to 'skilled' positions.  Anyone on the offense and defense (including offensive lineman), can dig deep in certain game situations.  The Check the Deck is back as well.  The deck will determine penalties, check players for injury, making adjustments to player's Diggin Deep chances, or any other unforeseen event that could happen during the course of a game.&#10;&#10;"
