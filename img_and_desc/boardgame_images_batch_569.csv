Players take turns casting out to explore tiles, then reeling in by claiming tiles with their tokens. The game has elements of memorization, poker-like bluffing, and some risk taking. The goal is to capture the most fish while staying away from hazards like old tires, boots, or weeds. The game contains 60 pond tiles, wooden player tokens and bonus fish pieces, a score pad and instruction booklet. Rules are simple enough for children as young as age 8, but there is enough strategy to make this enjoyable for adults as well. The game works well for 2-5 players and takes about 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;"

Additionally, unlike regular Farkel, players go out of the game once they reach 10,000 points. The winner is the remaining player with less than 10,000 points. With TWISTED Farkel, passing HIGH scores to your neighbor is the object of the game. When a player FARKELS, (i.e. score no points) their fellow players benefit.&#10;&#10;"

You'll need to buy paint, mix paint, work on painting the fresco, raise money by painting portraits (which you'll need to buy the aforementioned paint!), and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness. Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and frescos you would like to paint.&#10;&#10;Fresco: Big Box contains all of the material from the original Fresco game, plus all expansions released through the end of 2012 and the all new 2nd expansion (with modules 8, 9, and 10)!

Every round you must decide how many of your family members will go out searching for supplies, and how many will stay sheltered. Family members who are sheltered, are safe from disasters. Those that go out, might not come back. Next you draw 1 card from any area pile of your choice for each unsheltered family member and place them into your hand. After you've drawn your cards, you take care of your upkeep by discarding 1 food card and 1 water card. If you can't, then you lose a family member to starvation or dehydration.&#10;&#10;Once each player has taken a turn, the last player chooses a disaster card from the disaster deck of their choice. The red ones are the worst.  The disasters effect everyone at the same time. In order to survive the effects, you need to use the surplus cards you've collected in your hand. For example: The Oil Crisis Disaster card is drawn. It takes 1 shelter and 1 food away from everyone, or else you lose 1 family member. In my hand I have 2 Waters, 1 Food, a Generator and a Gas Mask.
