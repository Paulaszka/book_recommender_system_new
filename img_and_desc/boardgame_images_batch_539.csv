The goal of the game is to finish an opponent with one of your creature's attacks. However, each player is protected by 5 shields, represented by face-down cards from a player's own deck. When your creature attacks an opponent (and is not blocked by another creature) it breaks one of his shields, and the shield card goes to the owner's hand.  When your creature attacks a defenseless opponent, you win the game.&#10;&#10;The game has some similarities with the grandfather of collectible card games - Magic: the Gathering, which is also made by Wizards of the Coast. However, it has two major differences:&#10;1. There is no distinct card class for producing mana. The same cards, representing creatures and spells, can produce mana if placed in the Mana Zone instead of the Battle Zone. This removes what many see as a major flaw of Magic: the Gathering - &quot;mana flood&quot; and &quot;mana screw&quot;.&#10;2. There are no instant spells or activated abilities. Therefore, there are far fewer surprises for players from their opponents and also fewer tactical decisions during play. On the other hand, it plays quicker and can be easier for children to learn and understand. Even so, it has strong strategic aspects and fun deck building.&#10;&#10;"

Hoping to establish the pro-Israeli Christians as the legitimate government in Lebanon, the Israelis sent in the IDF, which soon became embroiled in vicious urban battles. The game also includes a 1975 scenario, as well as a 2006 scenario, showing the evolution of Israel&rsquo;s ongoing struggle against the PLO.&#10;&#10;Lebanon &lsquo;82 utilizes the Fire &amp; Movement combat system that is designed so that players can augment their units with &ldquo;Support Fire&rdquo; during the course of the battle. From artillery to air strikes, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. Lebanon &lsquo;82 also includes rules for a possible Syrian entry, and features the Syrian Surface to Air Missiles! Israeli air support could come under fire from Syrian fixed SAM batteries; more support fire will be necessary, but assets are limited.&#10;&#10;In Lebanon &lsquo;82, the attritional design of the Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare; Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties during a game, accurately replicating the realities of combat, especially during the street fighting encountered in 1982. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management &mdash; not merely odds ratios requiring numerical superiority. A stunning map of Lebanon depicts the entire battle area, ranging from the Israeli border to the capital Beirut itself &mdash; including all of the famous battle sites, such as the PLO refugee camps.&#10;&#10;"

Players start from a base and explore a cave, tunnel after tunnel, effectively building the board (the cave). They have to overcome steep descents, underground lakes, and tight squeezes. They will be given a chance to admire the wonders of the underground, like halls full of stalactites. To make it all possible they must take the right supplies with them, like ropes, oxygen and batteries.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have five action points to use for moving, discovering new cave tiles, exploring them, and packing their backpacks when they go back to the starting base. They need ropes for descents, oxygen to explore underwater parts, and a camera to photograph underground wonders. Planning what to take with them is one of the most important things in the game. Each turn that their pawn is not in the starting base, players must use (i.e., throw out) one basic supply from their backpack; these costs, along with the expenditure of other supplies during exploration, forces them to return to the starting base a few times during the game. To keep them from having to carry everything, though, players can raise a camp somewhere in the tunnels where they can store some of the equipment.&#10;&#10;The cave differs every game, so players have to be prepared for everything or they will lose time. Players earn points for exploring different tiles: underwater, wondrous, descents, and so on &ndash; but to win they'll need to acquire bonus prizes for exploring the most tiles of each type. This make decision-making during trips very difficult.&#10;&#10;When the cave is fully explored, the player who made the biggest effort in the most spectacular way wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

These are constructed on a goals scored and conceded basis using the final league table to ensure an accurate statistical base. Individual team ratings are used for Injuries and Suspensions, for Injuries reflecting the effect of an injury to a key player of players on the Squad strength of the team, thus ensuring that the teams with smaller and less flexible squads will suffer more severely from injury absentees, for Suspensions penalising those teams that have proved over the season that they are rarely able to field a full strength side because of this reason (e.g. Arsenal, Leeds). Cash is allocated to each club, allowing the rich to enter the transfer market more freely than their less wealthy rivals, provided the right player comes along of course. Transfers in and out, injuries and suspensions are dealt with in a fairly abstract way, as is necessary in a game that is about teams and not individuals. Opportunities will arise to strengthen the Attack/ Defensive Squad Values, players may have to be sold which have the reverse affect, all without names but all having an immediate effect on team strengths and performances.&#10;&#10;A day's fixtures, whether it be just a couple of mid-week matches or a full Saturday/Sunday programme, are valued as a complete package before any match is resolved. This involves checking for Injuries and Suspensions on a team-by-team basis and then assessing which Goal Card to use for each time by deducting one team's Defence Squad value from the opponent's Attack Squad value and rounding the result down to a figure divisible by ten. When all matches have been valued, a roll of two pairs of coloured dice per match will produce a half time score line, a second roll for each will give the full time result. Book keeping consists of marking up the result on the Results Matrix and up dating both the Cumulative Points and Goals For and Against Charts.&#10;&#10;"

The game ends when someone scores 5000 points; everyone else &quot;with a turn left&quot; then gets a chance to better this player's score.&#10;&#10;The historical notes claim that this is a real ancient Roman game, originating from the late republic.&#10;&#10;As of writing, this game is being sold in museum shops in the UK, at historic sites related to ancient Rome (e.g. sites on Hadrian's Wall).&#10;&#10;"

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, Red Skull in the base game), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose.&#10;&#10;Hero decks in the base game: Gambit, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Emma Frost, Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Storm, Captain America, Nick Fury, Rogue, Cyclops, Hulk, Wolverine, Deadpool&#10;&#10;"

Their task is simple: to hang clothes on the balconies.  But, the air and shaky hands might cause some of the clothespins, pinza de ropa in Spanish, to fall, or mysteriously end up on a higher floor of the building!&#10;&#10;The players alternate turns during which they try to have as many clothespins as possible on their floor.  Each player's floor is designated by a secret objective card (marked with a star).&#10;&#10;During their turn players choose a floor on the board, roll the dice, and then may play cards to affect the outcome of the dice.  Each number on the dice different from the player's floor means that a clothespin must go to another floor.  A special objective card indicates which floor is best for that player's clothespins.  The winner of the game is the one that gathers the most points, based on the special objective card and a player's played cards during the duration of the game.&#10;&#10;The print &amp; play version which will be available through this site and the publisher's page is the family version of the game.  A future version of Pinza de Ropa will include a new advanced version, with more cards, strategies, and surprises that will make the game even better!&#10;&#10;The only thing not provided in the print'n play version of the game are the 5 dice.

As the Confederate player, you must try to crush Hooker&rsquo;s unsuspecting army. As the Union player, you must regroup from the initial shock of the blow, hold onto the Chancellor House, and counter-attack against Lee&rsquo;s outnumbered forces.&#10;&#10;Following the debacle at Fredericksburg in December of 1862, President Lincoln replaced Burnside as commander of the Army of the Potomac with Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Hooker came up with one of the most audacious flanking maneuvers of the war. Leaving two corps at Fredericksburg to pin Lee, he would march the rest of his army north and west, cross the Rapidan River, and place himself at Chancellorsville. The move, if successful, would place the Army of Northern Virginia between two Union armies, ready to be crushed as if in a vise. The opening move worked, but then Hooker sat still as if waiting (or daring) for Lee to attack him. Lee did indeed attack. But the move was so unconventional as to catch Hooker completely by surprise. Lee divided his forces in the face of the enemy&mdash;a textbook no-no&mdash;not once, but twice! First, he left a group at Fredericksburg to delay any Union crossing in that area. Then, with his remaining forces, he left only two divisions in front of Hooker, while the remainder of his army under Jackson (28,000 strong) marched around the Union right and attacked them in the rear at sunset on May 2, 1863.&#10;&#10;CBM is an old-fashioned beer and pretzels game that is not burdened with cumbersome command &amp; control or supply rules.&#10;&#10;Paul Koenig's Bloody Civil War Series is based upon the intermediate system of Avalon Hill's Gettysburg 1977.&#10;&#10;"

According to the rules the object of the game is to monopolise as many 'Roo blocks' as possible by forming more 3-counter rows - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - than opponents. 10 points are scored each time a row of 3 is formed. A player rolls the dice to move around the track, and the track block on which he lands indicates the Roo block on which he is allowed to place one of his counters. When a particular Roo block means there is no chance for a player to start a row of 3 or block an opponent that block is considered dead and from then on no player moves to it. When all Roo blocks have been played out players compute their scores and highest score wins.&#10;&#10;Publication details from The Game Catalog: US Games Through 1950, 8th edition, 1998.
