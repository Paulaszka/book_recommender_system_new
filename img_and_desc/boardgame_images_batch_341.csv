The players are buying shares on a growing stock market, but at one time in the game the prices will crash. The players try to find out the right time to sell their shares and buy gold and silver (these are the victory points), before the market crashes.&#10;&#10;The actions of all players change the probability of the crash. When they start selling, the probability of the crash will get higher. If they only buy shares then the crash will come later.&#10;&#10;To win the game, you have to have a close look at what the others do to be in the position to sell the highest share at the right time, to get the most money. But the silver/gold price will rise too, and you can also win by buying silver/gold early in the game.&#10;&#10;This game is the first game in the Freitag-Projekt:&#10;&#10;Freitag(Friday)  is a game project started on Friday 24th of October in Essen.

After team selection each player will roll dice for selecting the highest position on the jump tower. Therefore all seven dice are rolled. After each roll at least one die has to be set aside face up. When all dice have been allocated the jumper is placed on the tower according to the rolled total result which is equivalent to a certain jump distance in meters. After all players are set up one player puts one of his jumpers for the jump. Then card play takes over. The effect of cards is to add or subtract jumping length from the a fore determined jumping length (the dice roll) or to move the jumper left and right on the hill simulating wind. Other players play cards for this jumper which are countered by the jumping player. This goes in turn i.e. player A plays card jumping player plays card, player B plays card jumping player plays card and so on until each non-jumping player had the chance to play a card. If the jumper is moved too much to the left or right or too long or too short of the board it is counted as a fall. Finally the jumping player plays a card for the landing again adding or subtracting metres. The final result will be noted down. The player which ski jumper has the farthest jump wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

A secondary goal was to make a dice game that is not completely multiple solitaire. The resulting game is played with 5 dice, hence the name, which is Japanese for '5 dice'.&#10;&#10;Every turn a player decides what 'development' he or she wants to roll for. These 'developments' change the nature of the game. Some allow re-rolling a die, others change how the dice-roll result is converted into a score or points. To achieve a certain development, at least a certain score has to be rolled. This required score increases with each development achieved. If a player rolls particularly high he/she can choose to take points rather than achieve the development he/she was rolling for. If there are no more developments available, the player must roll for points. The game ends when one player chooses to take points for the tenth time. The game takes about 10 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;"

As the new game changes the map of the original, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.&#10;&#10;M&eacute;gawatts is the French release of the Friedemann Friese game Power Grid. The French edition is produced by Filosofia.&#10;&#10;As with Power Grid, the object of M&eacute;gawatts is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;It differs from Power Grid by the maps included. Where Power Grid has the USA/Germany maps, the French version by Filosofia has the Qu&eacute;bec/France maps.&#10;&#10;The Qu&eacute;bec map uses minor rules change that makes a bigger use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional reality of hydro-electricity.&#10;&#10;The ruleset includes the basic game, as in Power Grid plus the minor rule changes for the two maps included.&#10;&#10; Re-Implements: &#10;&#10;&#10;     Power Grid&#10;     Funkenschlag&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Power Grid: France/Italy&#10;     Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe&#10;     Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)&#10;     Power Grid: The New Power Plants &#226;&#128;&#147; Set 1&#10;     Power Grid: China/Korea&#10;     Power Grid: Flux Generator&#10;&#10;&#10;The expansions Power Grid: France/Italy, Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe and Power Grid: China/Korea include new double-sided game boards.

Cities need wood to be built and that wood needs to be brought in from previously built cities. Cities also produce wood, and in some cases also metals. Forests can be cut to produce building timber only once, however. In fact, some areas that were known for their good timber before the Heian era, only produced firewood and charcoal at the end of the period. Hence, during the game, Japan slowly gets deforested and urbanized and resources are getting increasingly scarce. The player that managed to build and transport most efficiently and that built the most cities and the most (and best) buildings in the capital wins the game.&#10;&#10;"

If the player holds a bite card, then the player is able to take a fish card. If the player's tackle matches the ratings for both line and hook, as shown on the fish card, then the player lands the fish. &#10;However, if only one of the ratings match, the player must throw the `fight dice'. The throw determines whether the fish is caught, gets away, or whether a penalty is suffered, such as loosing your hook or breaking your line.&#10;&#10;Lurking amongst the normal fish is the Pike. If a player draws the pike card then it is possible to catch the pike if a Pike Buster card is held, otherwise you are likely to lose either part of your tackle or part of your previous catch.&#10;&#10;The game has been sponsored by Shimano, a fishing tackle company, but the inclusion of their logo in the computer generated graphics is very discrete and does not distract from the appearance.&#10;&#10;Very appealing game components make a good and light family game.&#10;&#10;"
