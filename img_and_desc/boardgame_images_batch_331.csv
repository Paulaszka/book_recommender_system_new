Along the entire front, hordes of refugees have flooded into Allied camps all telling the tales of the dead coming back to life. Something has gone horribly wrong and zombie German Army humanoids, known as Kroids, are attacking with organized military efficiency.&#10;&#10;- Who is leading the Kroids?&#10;At this time we have no idea who, or what, is controlling or leading these Kroid forces. Reports have led to speculation that the leader of the Kroids is a summoned demon that was resurrected or awakened by the experiments of the SS Project Diabolus team at Castle Wewelsburg in Germany.&#10;&#10;- Where do the Kroids come from?&#10;All we know at the moment is that they are the reanimated remains of fallen soldiers or zombies &ndash; but not the mindless zombies seen in the Dracula movies we watched in the theaters as kids. Instead, these zombies appear to independently think and communicate. As they attack and kill our troops their ranks grow in numbers. What we do know is that a dead soldier, in any condition, burned, missing limbs or shot all to hell will, if not 'finished,' rise as a Kroid within 24 hours. A 'finished' corpse is one that has had its head removed.&#10;&#10;- Why are the Kroids here and what do they want?&#10;Sadly we have no idea. We believe this is the result of same wacky Nazi secret weapon experiment gone horribly wrong and we will just have to deal with it as best as we can. We do know that a Nazi machine called the Cyclomatron was built and activated by a team of SS scientists and engineers working at Castle Wewelsburg in Germany. Somehow this machine is the power behind these Kroids.&#10;&#10;- How do we defeat the Kroids?&#10;To date our strategy has been one of attacking the Third Reich's ability to wage war. We have been very successful in dismantling their infrastructure by destroying factories, refineries and transport. We have denied them the ability to manufacture and deploy the tools of war. The Kroids have no supply lines and they pick their tools of war up off the ground. They do not need to eat; they do not need to sleep. Their machines do not run on gas and ball bearings. Simply put, we have to change our entire strategy. As commanders you must think with your head. A casualty in your command is a new recruit for the Kroid army. The orders you have already received detail our current strategy, which is one of containment. Until further notice we are going on the defensive.&#10;&#10;"

Play is in moves, which are determined by the relationship of the cards to one another. Some players find the interplay of the &quot;patterns&quot; a fascinating challenge. Other never see it. To find out whether it is &quot;your cup of tea&quot; you'll have to try it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Each player takes twelve cards from a normal deck of cards numbered from 1 to 13 (Ace to K). Then shuffles his cards and deals then in two lines of six cards each. The objective is, by moving two cards each turn, complete a pattern before the other player. The catch is that the moves you are allowed to make are based on your opponents' cards. If you do a difficult move, you win points, if you make an easy one you lose points. When you win a hand, you score the number of point you get that hand (can be zero).&#10;&#10;"
