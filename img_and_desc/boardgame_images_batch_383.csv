Made with ease of play and minimal record keeping in mind, Full Sail is geared for naval enthusiasts wanting a lighter, but fun game.&#10;&#10;Ships are broken into 1st-6th rate rankings.  Initiative is a simple, yet efficient dice mechanic.  Movement, which is based on the initiative roll, is easily learned and accounts for wind, ship direction and ship size.&#10;&#10;Games can range from a single ship per side to 4-5 ships per player without bogging down.  Both historical and non-historical scenarios can be played using this rule set.&#10;&#10;Full Sail is based on Brother Aelred Glidden's As Per Margin III rules found in the May/June 1999 #99 issue of Midwest Wargamers Association Newsletter (MWAN). Full Sail includes initiative, wind direction/speed and campaign rules as well as ship record sheets not included in the original rules.&#10;&#10;"

Just remember no talking during your turn!&#10;&#10;Each player assembles a clan of archaic Homo sapiens, Dino sapiens, Neanderthals, or Troglodytes. Archaic Homo sapiens are our primitive ancestors. They are physically weaker than their rivals, but make up for it with character types that include the nimble Florz (cave halflings) and Cave Nerds (who create amazing prehistoric &quot;technology&quot;). Dino sapiens are semi-intelligent dinosaur people who enlist fierce dinosaurs as their allies. Neanderthals have brawny fighters and shamans who use powerful magic. Troglodytes are the most primitive clan (making even Neanderthals look civilized) but have fearsome creatures like Trogres and the dreaded Dragonasaurus working for them.&#10;&#10;Sticks &amp; Stones is a 2-4 player card game. There are 110 cards, including characters from each clan, Woot! cards (events, gear, and special items), and Quest cards (challenges faced by your clan). An optional 5th player can serve as the Cave Master for the game. Players must resort to prehistoric roleplaying as they bluff, intimidate, and cajole each other--all without speaking during their turn!&#10;&#10;"

The player who played the lowest point value gets the ship card. After 12 rounds, the player with the LEAST total of points on his collected ship cards scores the most victory points (depending on the number of players).
