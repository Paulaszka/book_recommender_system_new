The game uses a deck of cards, comprising: 75 bird cards (3 of each species), 6 Hazards, 6 Protection cards and 1 Appeal card.&#10;&#10;6 cards are dealt to each player at the start of the game. The players then pick a card from the deck (or discard pile) and then play. Sets of species are built (Male, then Female, then Young) and a completed set forms a trick and is put to one side. Sets are built up in the spaces along the edge of the board facing the player; the species has to go in the appropriate habitat (as indicated on the card).&#10;&#10;Partial sets can be protected by Protection cards and destroyed by Hazard cards. The Appeal card allows you to take one card from another player, in return for the Appeal card, which can then be used again by its new owner. Some of the species are &quot;Rare Species&quot;. Completing these sets gains the player the appropriate counter.&#10;&#10;To end the game you have to get a certain number of sets of species, with the rare ones counting for 2 or 3, depending on the value on the counter. Points are then totaled, with each species set being worth 50 points, with the appropriate multiplier (x2 or x3) for the &quot;Rare&quot; species, and cards in front of each player (but not yet in completed sets) being worth 10 points each.&#10;&#10;"
