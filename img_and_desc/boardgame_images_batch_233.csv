The new game covers the same time period as the older ones (summer of 1941 to the spring of 1942) but uses a completely new Soviet OB, a new map, and the latest rules for the Europa system.&#10;&#10;Total War gives the Axis player the opportunity to see if he can improve on the massive offensive that pocketed and captured millions of Soviet soldiers. Can you take Moscow or Leningrad? Or are you condemned to suffer the Soviet winter short of victory? The Soviet player must build a strategic reserve large enough to stop the advancing Axis forces and throw them out of Russia. The Soviet player is aided by massive reinforcements that allow him to form new defensive lines in an attempt to slow down or stop the Axis armor thrusts.&#10;&#10;Total War is a historical game on the German invasion of the Soviet Union, from summer 1941 to spring 1942. It charts the titanic struggle of the largest ground campaign in World War II, from the Axis offensives that brought the Germans to the gates of Moscow to the Soviet winter counteroffensive that hurled them back.&#10;&#10;Total War is a two-player game. One side controls the forces of Germany and its allies while the other controls the forces of the Soviet Union. The maps cover Eastern Europe and the western USSR from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, from the plains of Poland to the steppes along the Volga River. Ground units represent corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions. Air units represent groups of 40 to 120 aircraft. Naval units represent task forces of warships.&#10;&#10;Total War is a complete remake and updating of the classic Europa game, Fire in the East. The game&rsquo;s Soviet order of battle makes extensive use of formerly secret Kremlin information on the Red Army forces that fought the war. The game includes a Soviet order of battle for all of the USSR from 1939 to 1942 and is the more comprehensive game OB ever published on the Red Army in peace and war. The Axis order of battle also is updated, reflecting new research since the publication of Fire in the East. The rules for Total War incorporate the latest rules for the Europa system, with on-demand air power, armor effects, combined arms, and much more, recreating both the German blitzkrieg that captured entire Soviet armies and the Soviet deep operations that nearly splintered the invaders in the depth of the Russian winter.&#10;&#10;(from Games Research/Design (GR/D) web site:)&#10;&#10;&#10;The box, counters and maps were printed and sold without complete rules.&#10;&#10;"

If there is no chip left on that number then the player takes any number of chips from numbers that add up to the total of the roll.

Graf Spee comes complete with die-cut counters, rules booklet, battle board and two movement boards.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another entry in the long line of AH Bismarck-style search and battle naval wargames, this one is very rare. As the name implies, it covers the search for the German &quot;pocket battleship&quot; Graf Spee in 1939.&#10;&#10;With the usual low-quality Third Millenia components (especially the counters) and very simple rules, it is nevertheless a pretty fun game.&#10;&#10;Like AH Bismarck, Midway, et al, movement and search are conducted on the two identical map sheets, and battles are resolved on the battle and charts sheet. Turn order is:&#10;a. German player rolls for bad weather (no searches). German player moves.&#10;b. British player searches.&#10;c. British player moves.&#10;d. German player searches.&#10;e. If both in same hex, resolve battle.&#10;f. When all battles are resolved, advance the turn record and start over.&#10;&#10;The British can search the hexes ships are in, and one more hex within four hexes (search aircraft). Aircraft carriers (4 British and 1 French) can search the six adjacent hexes. The German player can search the hexes ships are in, plus the Graf Spee has two search aircraft that can search within four hexes. The German player can also search any other three hexes on the board (u-boat reports?).&#10;&#10;Both players must keep track of fuel expenditures, and both have supply ships available to re-fuel (or they can re-fuel in ports). Every other turn the German player can roll on a table to sink one (or two) merchantmen. If he sinks any, he then rolls on another table to see how many turns later he must inform the British player in which hex the sinking occurred. The German player must sink a number of merchant ships and escape the map to win; otherwise the British player wins.&#10;&#10;No indication is given of map or time scale. I suspect search board turns are one day. 20 turns to a game.&#10;&#10;Components: two identical 14&quot; x 24&quot; hex-gridded search map sheets, one 14&quot; x 24&quot; battle and chart sheet, one rule folder (five small pages), plus 119 of 1/2-inch die-cut unit counters. &#10;I think there were 24 actual ship counters, some &quot;?&quot; s and &quot;search&quot; counters, and a bunch of blanks (my copy is unfortunately incomplete).&#10;&#10;"

The garden is set up and the pears are distributed, depending on the number of players pears are put onto the tree, always at one side, or a player hands on pears to be put up. Pears must be taken with one hand and always from the same side, and be put onto a branch of the three. Depending on the variant, one harvests pears that fall from the unused side, and may keep them or give them away. The player with the most valuable pears after a preset number of rounds wins the game.

Grant embarks on another attempt to wrest control of the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River from the rebels; the fortress city of Vicksburg. Numerous other attempts have failed miserably. The ill-fated campaign from the north, short circuited by that devil Forrest's raid on Grant's supply lines. The jinxed canal, dug through the swamps in an attempt to bypass the city's guns. Now another plan is in motion. Grant will march his Army of the Tennessee through the Louisiana swamps, sneak his ships past the rebel fortress in a daring run of the gauntlet, conduct the largest amphibious invasion in U.S. history, separate himself from his supply base, wedge himself in between two rebel armies, and seize control of the city from the east! All the while battling politicians and public opinion as much as the Confederate armies. Somehow, his daring plan worked, and the Mississippi once again flowed unvexed to the sea.&#10;&#10;But things could have been different. Find out how....&#10;&#10;This operational level game uses the block unit system to re-create the limited intelligence of the actual campaign. Players maneuver their forces without adequate knowledge of their opponents strengths or even location. The game board spans the campaign topography, from the swamps of eastern Louisiana to the mountainous terrain around Jackson Mississippi. A point to point movement system is employed on a 20 x 24 playing map. Limited command abilities and critical supply wagons are key to managing your armies and achieving victory.&#10;&#10;"

These intersections are called fighting positions.  Red, White and Blue designs across the battleground are called Line of Shot.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 9 white and 9 black washers that represent Battleships from two Navies.&#10;&#10;Each navy changes form (moves) in turn. Only one move is allowed at a time. The sinking of an opponents ship occurs when you manage to get two of your ships on the same line of shot as that of an enemy ship, with your nearest ship half way between the enemy and your back ship. When the range is so short that your two ships and the enemy lay in 3 consecutive positions then the enemy is captured and not sunk. When that happens you may remove the captured ship and place any of your ships in one of the starting positions. This allows you to fix placement errors by returning your ship to the start.&#10;&#10;"
