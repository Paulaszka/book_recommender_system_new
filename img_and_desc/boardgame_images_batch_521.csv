Everyone plays at the same time. One tweegle card is revealed from the deck, with the card showing one of five tweegle types and one of five possible actions, symbolized by scissors, a mosquito, an electrical socket, a stamp and spray bottle.&#10;&#10;Everyone searches for the action card that &quot;completes the story&quot; begun with the first card. If a tweegle card shows scissors, for example, you need to find the cut-up tweegle among the face-up action cards. To claim the card, however, you need to perform the appropriate gesture: slapping the card if a mosquito is involved, hammering it with your fist if the tweegle was stamped, and so on. The first player to do this claims the tweegle card, while the action card remains on the table.&#10;&#10;Whoever claims the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;"

Some action spaces allow players to collect money, while others offer players a way to spend that money to acquire points.  Other action spaces allow players to engage in various set collections that score points for assembling those sets.  Some action spaces simply award players points for stopping on them, or give the player a randomly determined action from all of the other types.&#10;&#10;All of the actions in Tokaido are very simple, and combined with a unique graphic design, Tokaido offers players a peaceful zen mood in its play.&#10;&#10;"

While inexplicably working in the same field, two to four shepherds try to move sheep into the right areas to score points. During a turn, you must take three actions, chosen from these possibilities:&#10;- Move your shepherd&#10;- Move one sheep&#10;- Buy one terrain tile&#10;&#10;You must move your shepherd at least once during your turn, and you can't take the same action twice in a row without moving the shepherd in between the two actions.&#10;&#10;Six different terrain types are available, with five tiles of each type and increasing costs (from 0 to 4 dinars). When you buy a tile, you're not claiming land on the game board, but rather investing in that type of landscape as that's where you expect the sheep to end up grazing. At the end of the game, you score 1 point per tile of a terrain type for each sheep in a region of this type; you also score for coins still in hand.&#10;&#10;The map on the game board shows regions separated by roads: three regions of each terrain type for a total of 18 regions. Numbered &quot;rest stops&quot; lie along the roads, with each rest stop between exactly two regions. Shepherds move from one rest stop to another, with the first movement being free and all the others on the same turn costing 1 coin. When you buy a terrain, you can purchase the top tile of either of the two terrain types next to your shepherd. When you move a sheep, you move one sheep from a region adjacent to your shepherd to the other region adjacent to that piece, i.e., you lead the sheep across the road to a greener pasture &ndash; well, greener for you, if all goes well.&#10;&#10;Each time you move the shepherd, you place a fence in the rest stop from which it started moving, making that location off-limits for the rest of the game. During the game some regions become inaccessible and, if they are full of sheep, a rush for the tiles takes place. The only black sheep in the game, which is worth two points, serves as a semi-random element, possibly moving to an adjacent region each turn while still being movable by shepherds as long as it's not fenced in.&#10;&#10;After twenty fences have been placed, you end the round so that all players have the same number of turns, then you count up the points.&#10;&#10;"

The 16-page instruction manual includes directions for six simple math games, including Spider's Web, Big Numbers, Match Points, On the House, Shout Out and Prime Time.&#10;&#10;Spider's Web: &#10;The dice are rolled onto a bull's eye board divided into eight pie sections labelled one through eight.  Depending on where the die landed, it is multiplied, added or subtracted from the number of the pie piece in which it landed.  No points are scored for dice which land in the exact center or off the board completely.  The winner is the first to reach a score of 300.&#10;&#10;Big Numbers: &#10;Using the same board as Spider's Web, players roll the three dice onto the board, then scramble to be the first to find the largest three-digit number possible, using either the face value of the dice or the number slices into which they landed.  This game teaches place value and the winner is the first to reach 2,000.&#10;&#10;Match Points: &#10;Each player rolls one die onto the spider web board, making a fraction with the smaller of the die or number slice value (on which the die landed) being the numerator.  When a player has collected enough fractions to be one or greater, he scores a point and starts over collecting fractions.  The first player to collect five whole numbers wins.&#10;&#10;On the House:&#10;Using the game board with six numbered houses, each player rolls one die onto the game board.  If the die matches any digit in the house square on which it landed, the player scores.  Scoring involves adding each of the digits of the three-digit number on the board together, then multiplying by the die value.  The winner is the first player to reach 250 points.&#10;&#10;Shout Out:&#10;A designated shooter rolls two dice off the board and one die onto the haunted house board.  Depending on which of the six house squares the die lands, all players race to perform the required math operations on the three dice first.  The first player to be the first ten times wins.&#10;&#10;Prime Time:&#10;Each player rolls the three dice onto the haunted house board, then looks for prime numbers amongst the sum of the die and door number, the dice themselves and the door numbers themselves.  Any missed primes may be stolen by other players.  The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.&#10;&#10;"
