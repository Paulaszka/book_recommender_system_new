During Development, players take turns playing one card from their hand either as an animal (face-down) or as a trait on one of their existing animals (face-up and tucked under the animal). Traits include Carnivorous, Camouflage, Sharp Vision, Swimming, Poisonous and Communication; if a card has two traits, the player chooses which trait the animal acquires, hiding the other trait under the animal. Once a player passes during this phase, he can no longer play cards.&#10;&#10;During Food Bank Determination, a player rolls 1-2 dice (possibly adding two to the total) to determine the amount of food available for the round.&#10;&#10;During Feeding, players take turns acquiring one food cube and &quot;feeding&quot; one of their animals. Some traits give animals special abilities that can be used during Feeding or at other points during the game. Animals can also be carnivorous, allowing them to attack one other animal to feed &ndash; although that animal might have a defense like High Body Weight or Tail Loss that allows it to survive. An animal can't take more food than it needs unless it has fat tissue, which allows it to store food for future rounds.&#10;&#10;During Extinction and Draw, any animal not fully fed dies; the owner takes that animal and all traits and stacks them in his personal discard pile.

To win one must capture two of the opponents &quot;JEL&quot; pieces, which also have the ability to move and attack. The playing pieces are of various military and civilian ranks (JEL, Secret Service, General, Admiral,Army, Nacy, Airforce, and Marines). Each has a particular set of rules in how it can be moved, how far, or under what conditions/direction it can attack. Black squares on the game board represent land, while white squares represent water. Certain pieces may only move or attack on either by virtue of their class (Navy can only move/attack on water, while army can only move/attack on land).&#10;&#10;"

The tiles are placed between the players so each player faces one color edge (all tiles have to be aligned accordingly). Each edge contains a number which forms a larger number together with all the tiles in one row. There are also commas, which can turn a potentially large number into a very small one. The idea is to place commas in positions which are at the rear of one's own line, but at the front of another player's, so the other player's number is minimal and the own one is large.&#10;A turn consists of simply flipping over one tile and placing it into the grid.

The game board is a modular board built of hex tiles representing a landscape with fields of flowers and hornet nests of various sizes. The players have an identical deck of action cards and each card can be used multiple times. Each game turn, players secretly pick an action card that is revealed simultaneously with the other players. The actions are resolved in the numerical order of the action cards, with each player allocating the action to either one of their hornets on the game board. The hornets compete to collect nectar from the flower fields that is in turn used to produce honey in the nests. The winner of each hornet nest is resolved in a pre-determined order, with the winner being the player with the most honey in the nest. The game is won immediately by conquering three nests or by having won two nests by the end of the game with the highest aggregate amount of honey produced. The nature of the various action cards ensures high player interaction, causes a need for pre planning a number of turns ahead and allows the execution of cunning tactical moves. The easily comprehensible rules, variable game set-up and eye catching artwork with a cheerful theme facilitate an enduring and pleasant gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Box back text:&#10;Hornet is a stinging tactical boardgame for the entire family in which players need to anticipate the moves of their opponents and at times also bluff a bit.
