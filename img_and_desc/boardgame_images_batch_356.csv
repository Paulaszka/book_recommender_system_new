In their turn, a player may: form a new word from their hand; add from their hand to either end of a word already on the table; discard any number of their cards to the bottom of the draw pile; or pass.  If they played or added to a word, they score all points in the word, then draw back up to 10.  If a wild card is on the table, and they have a card for the letter it stands for, they may swap it for the wild card, at the start of their turn.&#10;&#10;Play ends when the draw pile is exhausted and one player exhausts his hand or everyone passes in turn.

The obstacles come in the form of traps and adversaries. The traps are whatever the players imagine them to be they could be a pit of spikes, a falling boulder, etc. The adversaries are met by the players by means of a random encounter system, defeating adversaries will most certainly garner usable rewards for the players. In ROLL DICE KILL MONSTERS HAVE FUN DUNGEON CRAWLER there are two kinds of mazes. The first is to successfully reach the finish from a set start point. The second is to successfully meet and defeat a boss type character. ROLL DICE KILL MONSTERS HAVE FUN DUNGEON CRAWLER is the groundbreaking amalgamation of a board game and an analog role playing game, without any of the convoluted aspects of analog role playing games.&#10;&#10;"

Forces can be created in one of three ways: using a simple random force generation system to get you playing quickly, a more advanced system for experienced players, and a detailed points system for the ultimate in flexibility. Though the system is easy to learn and play, this doesn&rsquo;t mean the game is lacking details.&#10;&#10;In fact, there are actually three levels of play. First you will learn the Basic Game, which provides all the core rules necessary to head off into battle. Then, as you become familiar with the system, you might want to consider using some of the Advanced Rules, which will add more depth to your gaming experience. Finally, there are a number of Optional Rules which you can incorporate into your games to add even greater detail. The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;Fast and Dirty is a generic system, specifically designed to work with a wide array of settings and miniatures. Feel free to devise your own worlds and forces, based upon the miniatures in your collection.&#10;&#10;"

An aircraft&rsquo;s position determines if it can attack, and how many bonus Bursts it receives if it is Advantaged or Tailing.&#10;&#10;The game uses a simple Altitude system to add this vital aspect of air combat.

There are affinities with Perudo (and the card game Cheat), but also some interesting differences. Mia is often purported to have been played by the Vikings.&#10;&#10;Players take turns rolling the dice beneath a cup and announcing a higher roll than the previous roll.  This announcement can be challenged, with the roller losing a life if caught lying, and the challenger losing a life if the roller was truthful (players typically start with three lives).  There is also the option (instead of rolling the dice oneself or challenging the previous roller) of  passing your turn (without viewing the roll under the cup) to the next player.  In this case the passer assumes responsibility for the roll as if he or she had rolled it him- or herself.  (Thus, if the next player challenges the announced value, it is the passer who stands to lose a life if the value under the cup is not that which was announced.)&#10;&#10;One interesting feature of Mia is the non-standard ordering of rolls. &quot;21&quot; is &quot;Mia&quot;, the highest roll.  Next come the doubles in ascending order: 11 is the second best roll, then 22, 33, 44, 55, 66.  From there the numbers descend, with the higher die always naming the tens value and the lower die naming the ones value:  65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 54, 53, 52, 51, 43, 42, 41, 32, and 31 as the lowest value.&#10;&#10;"

In a turn, a player draws 1 from the draw or discard pile, lays down a word or passes, and discards down to 7 if needed.  Each word scores 5 per black vowel (there must be at least 1 per word), plus 1 per colored letter if there are at least 2 of them and they're all the same color; all doubled if the word is a palindrome (spelling another word backwards).  Game ends after the draw pile's gone and all pass; highest total wins.&#10;&#10;Alpha: Deal 7 face up to each player.  In a turn, a player draws 1 and makes a word or passes and discards down to 7.  If a word is played, each other player in turn gets a chance to add cards from their hand to the played word to make a different word, without changing the order.  The last to add to the word wins it.  Words score 1 per letter, doubled if monochrome, doubled if a palindrome.&#10;&#10;Beta: A solitaire game.  Deal 6 cards out in a line, starting 6 columns.  You may move individual cards to the top of bottom of another column, removing words as completed.  When done moving, deal another card to the bottom of each column (or empty slot if a column is empty).  Continue until the deck is gone, trying to eliminate the whole deck.&#10;&#10;Capa: A bridge-like partnership trick-taking game.  Players first bid the number of words to make, along with a color (not black).  Highest bid gets his color as trump, and his partner is dummy.  Player to his left leads first.  All plays must follow suit if possible, unless black is led.  If a word is made in the color led, the leader wins the trick; if a word is made in a different color or multiple colors, the one who added the last card to it wins; if no word is made the leader wins.  If the contractors get as many words as bid, they score for all words won, else the opponents score for all the words they won; words are scored as in Alpha.&#10;&#10;"
