Player one places one in front of them, and rolls the die. The die roll tells them which letter will be in play this game. 1 = top letter, 2 = second letter down, and so on.

They roll the die again, and the letter from the second tile is chosen as with the first. Player one then takes the second tile and overlaps the first, so that the two active letters are side by side.&#10;&#10;Player two determines their active letters the same way. The timer is started, and players list as many words as possible that start with the left letter and end with the right.&#10;&#10;When time runs out, the player with more words scores the difference in the number of words between the two players.&#10;&#10;If player one makes 10 words and player two makes 7, player one scores 3 points.&#10;&#10;For the next round, each player must rotate a tile, change the order of the tiles, or perform any combination of the two.&#10;&#10;First player to 20 points wins.&#10;&#10;To increase the intensity, increase the required number of letters per word to 4, 5, or 6.&#10;&#10;Created by indigopotter for Reprint&#039;s contest, February 2009.&#10;&#10;"

If three pieces land with colored side up, a player wins 1 point.  Any other combination yields no points.  If you win any points, you get to go again.

Quote:&#10;&#10;It has often been remarked that the early Celtic inhabitants of Britain contributed very little to the stock of English words. Perhaps this should not surprise us, given the difficult relations over the centuries between the people of Germanic stock and the people of Celtic stock in England and Ireland. It seems likely that a certain English contempt resides in the adoption of the word hubbub from a Celtic source, which is probably related to ub ub ubub, a Scots Gaelic interjection expressing contempt, or to abu, an ancient Irish war cry. In any case, hubbub was first recorded (1555) in the phrase Irish hubbub and meant &quot;the confused shouting of a crowd.&quot; In addition to the senses it has developed, hubbub was again used, possibly in an unflattering way, by the New England colonists as a term for a rambunctious game played by Native Americans.&#10;&#10;"

Its games are a slight twist on the usual rules of its rivals.&#10;&#10;There are 54 cards in the deck.  52 of them have a letter and a value from 10 to 50 (the Q card actually has two letters, QU); there are also 2 jokers (wild cards) worth 100.&#10;&#10;The rules to 6 games are given:&#10;&#10;Cross-O-Grams: For 2+ players (but if 4 or more, 2 decks are recommended).  Deal 12 each.  In a turn a player either makes a word on the table from his hand, or draws one and passes; if his hand only X, Y or Z he may discard one of those before drawing.  Words are at least 2 letters long, and after the first word, new words must intersect or extend previous words, crossword fashion.  A hand ends when a player goes out or the draw pile runs out.  The value of the cards in hand goes to the winner of the round, and the highest total wins after an agred time; or, players get their own totals in hand at the end of a round, and when one player reaches 500, the lowest total wins.&#10;&#10;An-O-Grams: For 2-8 players, but use 2 decks for 4+ players. Deal 12 each.  In a turn, a player: plays a word of 3+ letters to the table in front of him; or adds 1+ letters to a word on the table to make it a new word (without changing the letters' order), taking the word to himself; or draws 1 card and passes.  Simple endings (-S, -ED, -ER) are forbidden.  The round ends when a player goes out or the deck runs out.  Each player scores the points in front of him minus the points in hand; a player who goes out before the deck runs out doubles his table points.&#10;&#10;Casino-Grams: For 2-4 players.  Take out the jokers and deal 4 to each player and 4 face-up to the table.  In a turn a player plays one of his cards to the table and does one of the following: A) makes a word with it and other table cards, placing the word in front of him; B) builds toward a future word, combining 1 card with table cards, announcing the letter(s) he has that will be played later; C) steals a word from someone else by adding a letter to it and making a new word; D) leaves it on the table with the other table cards.  After the cards are played, 4 more are dealt to each player (but no more to the table), and play continues.  After all the cards are played, the one who made or stole the last word gets the remaining table cards.  Each player gets 1 point per card he has on the table; the game is won on reaching 100.&#10;&#10;Cross-O-Gram Solitaire: Like Klondike, 7 piles are dealt out of height 1-7 cards, the top one exposed.  Combine the visible cards to build words into a crossword array.  When stuck, start turning the remaining deck 3 at a time and use those cards to continue.  (Or, do it 1 at a time, going through the deck only once.)  You win if you use up the whole deck.&#10;&#10;Cross-O-Gram Double Solitaire: The solitaire above played with 2 players, with decks of different colored backs.  Take turns playing until you can play to the table.  The game ends when neither can add anything to the crossword, and the one with the most cards out wins.&#10;&#10;Canister Solitaire: Deal the whole deck into 8 columns face-up, fanned vertically so you can see what's coming.  There will be 6 each in 4 columns, 7 each in the other 4.  Repeatedly make words only from the letters at the bottom of the columns, discarding them as they are made.  You win if you use all the cards up.&#10;&#10;"

Each card has ratings in three categories: Fastball, Changeup, and Specialty.  The pitching team selects one of his pitchers, then the hitting team places down one of his hitters, face-down.  The pitching team then chooses one of the three categories, the hitter's card is revealed, and the higher total in the selected category wins.  Each team gets to play 9 hitters, and the team with the most hitters' victories wins the game.&#10;&#10;In 2011, additional rules were added to form the &quot;Major League&quot; rules, and the original ruleset was dubbed the &quot;Home Run Derby&quot;; cards were designed with additional information for the new rules. Under the Major League rules, the game takes place on a &quot;baseball field&quot; poster provided in the starter set. One pitcher pitches for an entire inning, but may not throw the same pitch twice in a row. Hits are no longer automatically home runs, but the batter moves a number of bases as indicated on his card. Players have offensive and defensive abilities that allow them to change the effects of hits, pitches, runs, and outs. Ball fields and mascots were added to the card set, and can affect the game.&#10;&#10;From the starter box back:&#10;&#10;Introducing Topps Attax, the new card game that puts you in charge of the action!
