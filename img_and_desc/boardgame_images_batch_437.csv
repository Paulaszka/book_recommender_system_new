If a Rainy Day card is drawn, any Cogmen who don&rsquo;t find shelter will get wet and rust (a terrible fate!)&#10;&#10;Beginning with the starting player, players take turns moving all of their Cogmen, who must spend Energy to move. At the end of the turn, any Cogmen dangerously low on Energy (and not near a Winder) may make a Desperation move, one last push towards a Winder before becoming unwound. A Cogman that becomes unwound is inoperable until he is wound up by an ally.&#10;&#10;Cogmen gather the cogs that are scattered about Cogsburg, returning them to the Cogtower to gain victory points, or he may choose to repair a broken/rusted Cogman instead.

Each player recieves one Victory Point for every cog they supplied to the Cogtower, plus an additional point for each operable Cogman.&#10;&#10;The basic game is for two players.

80621,,"Fool's Poker is a surprisingly deep poker variant which retains the hidden information and bluffing of poker but adds a strong deductive element.  It is played with a traditional 52-card deck.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, all players are have hands of size 5.  Each round, the players are dealt a new hand.  One player calls out a 5-card poker hand that they believe can be made by the collective cards of all the players.  The player to their left must call the previous player's bluff by saying &quot;BS&quot; or similar, or otherwise state a higher hand of their own.  Play continues clockwise until a player's bluff has been called.  Players pool their cards and see if the last name hand can be assembled from their cards.  If the hand is possible, the hand size of the player who called the bluff drops by 1.  Otherwise, the hand of the player whose bluff was called decreases by 1.&#10;&#10;The next round begins with fresh hands using the new lower hand limits.  The player who called &quot;BS&quot; last round starts the new round.  If a player's hand size drops to zero, they are out of the game.  Play continues until the players only have 4 cards between them, and the player with most cards remaining is the winner.&#10;&#10;Rules for hands:&#10;Pair, Two Pair, 3 of a Kind, Full House, and 4 of a Kind: must name their card values&#10;Straights, Flush, and Straight Flush: must name their high card&#10;Flush and Straight Flush: also must name their suit&#10;&#10;Variant: The 2's are wild able to take any value and suit.

The game is played with eight wooden marbles for each player (white and black, respectively) on an 8 by 8 square grid of indents. The objective of the game is to capture the opponent&rsquo;s marbles. At the beginning each player places his or her marbles in the first row (i.e. the row closest to the respective player).  Each player then on turn moves one marble of choice. A marble may move horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) as far as the player wants but is not allowed to jump over other marbles (of either color). Change of direction during a move is not allowed. Marbles are captured in one of two ways:&#10;&#10;     by capturing one or more of the opponents marbles (in an unbroken row or column) between two of one&rsquo;s own marbles.&#10;     by moving a marble into an empty space in-between two of the opponents marbles, which are both captured.&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player is left with only one marble (unless he/she is able to win the game in the subsequent move by capturing two of the opponent marbles) and the other player is the winner.&#10;&#10;The rule sheet that comes with the game has a couple of diagrams illustrating the two types of capture.&#10;The nice, small wooden board is in two hinged halves with storage compartment for the marbles inside when closed.&#10;&#10;"

The Michigan Rummy board consists of nine sections.  WINNING PAY CARDS are indicated next to each section on the board.  The round center section is the Michigan Rummy Pot.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;(1) THE DEAL.  The deal is determined by cutting the cards, high card winning the deal.  Players then place one chip in each of the3 nine sections of the plastic tray, except the dealer who places two chips in each section.  The dealer shuffles the cards and deals all of them out, one card at a time to each player, to the left.  One extra, or dummy hand, is dealt in front of the dealer.  It does not matter if some players receive one more card than others.&#10;&#10;(2) THE PLAY.&#10;(a) The dealer picks up either one of the two hands before him.  The dealer may, after looking at his hand, have the option of exchanging his hand for the dummy hand (but without looking at the dummy hand) or selling the dummy hand to the player making the highest bid for it.  Any player (including dealer) cannot exchange his hand for the dummy hand if he holds a PAY CARD.  The exchange of hands must be made complete.  Player cannot retain any of the cards in his original hand.  The amount of chips bid for the dummy hand go to the dealer and the player making the bid then exchanges his own hand for the dummy hand.  The extra hand is then put aside.&#10;&#10;(b) POKER. Before beginning the actual play of MICHIGAN RUMMY a hand of poker is played for the chips in the poker pool section.  Each player forms their best poker hand with five cards from his hand.  The remainder of their hands are kept face down in front of them for later use. The dealer starts the betting and can bet, or pass, the other players doing likewise.  The bets and raises are placed in the poker pool section, and the winning hand receives all these chips.&#10;&#10;(c) MICHIGAN RUMMY. The players take up all their cards and the dealer starts by playing the lowest card of any suit in his hand he wishes (Ace is high, duece is low).  He MUST play the lowest card of the suit he chooses.  He calls out the card and places it in front of him.  The player who holds the next higher consecutive card in the same suit plays it, placing it in front of him and calling out its name, etc., and this continues until the Ace of the suit is played, or a STOP is reached (due to the dummy hand holding the next high card).  The player who played an ACE or STOP card reopens with the lowest card in his hand in ANOTHER suit and play continues accordingly.  If a player cannot reopen with a card of another suit after a STOP, play ends there and there is no payment for the deal.  Any player who plays a PAY CARD takes all the chips from the corresponding section of the playing board (i.e. if you play the King of Clubs you collect all the chips in the King of Clubs section).  In order to collect for some PAY CARDS, they must be played in sequence by the same player (i.e. Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and 7, 8, and 9 of any suit).  The first player to discard all his cards wins all the chips in the Michigan Rummy Pot (round center section).  A variation may be played by having the winner collect one chip from each of the other players for every card remaining in that player's hand, in addition to the Michigan Rummy Pot.  The game is then over and the deal goes to the left for the next game.&#10;&#10;The players again place a chip in each of the nine sections (the dealer placing two chips in each section) even though some chips may still remain from previous play.&#10;&#10;After the final game of play, it may be found that chips remain in several sections of the playing board.  If this is the case, all of these chips may be placed in the POKER POOL section and a &quot;showdown&quot; hand of poker may be played.  Five cards are dealt face up to each player and the player with the best POKER HAND wins all the remaining chips on the board.  If players are not familiar with hand values in poker, below is listed, in order, winning combinations:&#10;(1) Straight Flush (3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of five cards all one suit.&#10;(2) Four of a kind.&#10;(3) Full house (three of a kind and one pair).&#10;(4) Flush--all one suit, but not in sequence.&#10;(5) Straight--(3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of different suits.&#10;(6) Three of a kind.&#10;(7) Two pairs.&#10;(8) One pair.&#10;&#10;Also see:&#10;&#10;    Tripoley&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each player stacks these nine cards face-down. At the same time, they each take the top card of their stack and reveal them in the center of the table. Each player then grabs one card that he desires, possibly his own. This process is repeated nine times, giving each player nine ingredients that they &quot;chose&quot;.&#10;&#10;Each player then creates three sandwiches, each containing three of their nine ingredients. The players give one sandwich to three neighbors on the left (dividing them differently in a three-player game), so that everyone has three sandwiches in front of them created by other players. Players then take turns &quot;tasting&quot; the sandwiches on their plate, reading the ingredients aloud, then stating which one sounds best (worth 3 points for its creator), which is second-best (2 points) and which would be left on the plate (0 points).&#10;&#10;After three complete rounds &ndash; nine sandwiches total &ndash; the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;"

80980,,"Jumping Chess is a chess variant played on a 10x10 board The rules are similar to those of orthodox chess, except that pieces capture by jumping over opposing pieces, as in Checkers or Draughts. The standard orthodox chess array is used, but in order to avoid uncapturable pieces at the edge of the board, two extra ranks and two extra files of edge squares are added. These edge squares can only be entered as the result of a capturing jump, and pieces sitting on them are obliged to capture if possible. The object of the game is to capture the opposing King, not to checkmate it.&#10;&#10;This game won the Chess Variant Pages 100 Square Contest.&#10;&#10;"
