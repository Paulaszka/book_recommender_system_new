The dealer chooses the direction of play (e.g. clockwise). Each player is dealt 6 cards and the remainder of the cards is placed into 2 draw piles.

After each round the winner is the dealer and starts the game.&#10;&#10;The dealer turns over a top card from one of the 2 piles to begin a discard pile. This is the starting card. The dealer must match this card by playing the same COLOR, same NUMBER, same TEAM or same SPECIAL card. If the player wants to pass or is unable to play, he/she must pick up one card from any pile. This card can be played, or another or the player can pass.&#10;&#10;It is possible to play several cards at the same time, if they have same number, same team or same symbol (special cards), regardless of the color(s). It is therefore possible to play combination of number and teams.&#10;&#10;Each player can collect his/her 5 players in front of him. It counts as a played card. It is possible to place several players at the same time.

Each card has four family-friendly words (one per edge) and a point value between 1 and 5. 1-point cards have words with the most connections (some with over 30), while 5-point cards have words with fewer connections. But don't worry, as well over 12,000 connections are known to be available!&#10;&#10;There are a half a dozen ways to play the game.&#10;&#10;Players compete to get the highest score by connecting related words. For example, TEACHER can be connected with STUDENT, SCHOOL, RESPECT, LEARNING, JOB as well as a dozen other words.&#10;&#10;Hilarious dialog begins when someone attempts a dubious connection and has to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; it to the group. This makes it a game about connecting people.&#10;&#10;Other ways to play include Match, Memory, Grid, Airplane Mode, Secret Connections and Team Secrets.&#10;&#10;This family and party game is for use at home and school as well as corporate office team building.&#10;&#10;SideLinks is the next version of the Connections card game, renamed for worldwide distribution as we only had the Canadian trademark for &quot;Connections&quot;.

Before you can reach your Landing Zone, your chopper crashes, many kilometers away from your destination. Salvaging what you can from the wreckage, armed with a GPS uplink, your wits and weapons, you must fight your way through an unknown and hostile jungle. Your only possibility for survival: &#10;Get to da Choppa!&#10;&#10;About the Game-&#10;    &#10;Get to da Choppa! is a solo dice game that&rsquo;s free to print and play.&#10;&#10;Your goal is to get your Squad through several areas (called Zones) of the wild jungles of South America. However, this area of the jungle has fallen victim to a number of hostile forces. Drug Lords, UFOs, invisible alien hunters, Nazis, zombies, headhunters, dinosaurs; any jungle action movie trope you can think of you&rsquo;ll have to face and try to survive. You will need to balance moving, stealth, foraging for supplies and combat to survive. The only way to win is to Get to da Choppa before your squad is wiped out.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you roll nine dice and can re-roll and keep any dice you like up three total rolls. You place the dice on your Squad sheet to follow the turn's order and show how many dice you have placed to a certain activity that turn. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of where all the dice rolled are placed, and what they mean.  &#10;&#10;     Enemy Contact- Your Squad encounters an obstacle or enemy that needs to be dealt with.&#10;     Salvage- Some of your Squad forages for supplies and ammo.&#10;     March- Your Squad moves along your path towards the next Check Point.&#10;     Stealth- Your Squad attempts to move slowly and avoid detection from an Enemy Contact.&#10;     Engage- Your Squad readies for combat! Lock and Load!&#10;     Command- Can be used as an additional die during each of the Salvage, March, Stealth and Combat phases. They can also be used to re-roll any single die on the Salvage, Combat, Injury, Recovery or Supply Shortage tables.&#10;&#10;&#10;The drama of the story unfolds by balancing the lives of your squad with the risks and combat you are willing to get into, as well as ensuring enough resources. Each turn brings you closer to the next checkpoint, where you will need to rest, restock, and heal up. The game ends by reaching the fourth Zone's Checkpoint where the extraction Chopper is waiting to take what's left of your squad back to safety. Victory conditions are calculated by a simple number of Squad members survived, or a slightly more involved scoring system.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;Results of the 2020 Solo PnP Design Contest for Get to da Choppa!&#10;&#10;Best Overall Game: 19th&#10;Best Easy to Build Game: 9th&#10;Best Original Artwork: 10th&#10;Best Game Designed in Contest Timeframe: 5th &#10;Best New Solitaire Designer: 8th&#10;Best Push Your Luck/Survival: 3rd&#10;&#10;"

While exploring the forbidden lands outside the city walls, Robyn befriends a free-spirited girl, Mebh, a member of a mysterious tribe rumored to have the ability to transform into wolves by night. As they search for Mebh&rsquo;s missing mother, Robyn uncovers a secret that draws her further into the enchanted world of the WOLFWALKERS and risks turning into the very thing her father is tasked to destroy.&#10;&#10;ABOUT THE BOARD GAME&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to find three parts of the wolf soul in one colour and bring it back to the Lair before soldiers, who start in the town area on one side of the board, reach the Lair on the opposite side of the board.&#10;&#10;The central board has a grid (called road) with fields marked with four different symbols. Some of the fields are connected with a path to the area with stacks of tiles. There are rune symbols at each intersection which represent the runes players collect during the game to buy the tiles. The grid is divided into three town areas with two fields marked for soldiers at the top of the board and nine forest areas at the bottom with the Lair area where players start the game &ndash; each with their own Wolfwalker figure.&#10;&#10;Each area has a stack with a certain number of tiles which depends on the mode players choose. In general, there are four types of tiles: a) tiles that move soldiers toward the Lair; b) wolf souls that the players try to find (three parts in three colours); c) tiles that help players find the wolf souls or change the soldier movements and d) neutral tiles. Each game mode adds some tiles or changes their meaning.&#10;&#10;On their turn, the player rolls a die and moves along any road. They have to stop on the first field with a symbol matching the symbol on the die. Then they count the rune symbols they passed on their way and take the rune tokens which are used to buy the tiles. It is possible to get more than one rune in one turn (if you pass two rune symbols, you get two runes, etc.). If the field they ended their movement on is connected with a path to a stack of tiles, they reveal the top tile(s). If they reveal a soldier tile, they have to move one of the soldiers in the direction shown on the tile. If the tile has a price (wolf souls, tiles that help players) the player can buy it with runes they collected. If the bought tile is a wolf soul, they place it in front of them. If it is any other tile, they have to use it immediately (e.g., you have another turn; move one of the soldiers in any direction).&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are two special symbols on the die that allow players to either reveal any top tile on the board or buy any revealed tile on the board.&#10;&#10;The game has three cooperative game modes with each adding additional rules and new tiles (e.g., look at the top tile of any stack, then place it on top of any pile face down) or more soldier tiles to make the game more difficult. The fourth mode is the competitive mode with the player who collects the completed wolf soul and brings it back to the Lair first winning.&#10;&#10;At the end of the rules you can also find achievements (e.g., win three games in a row, play solo with two Wolfwalker figures) and challenges that change the rules a bit in a unique way (e.g., win with soldiers being at the two rune symbols at the top of the board at the end of the game; each player looks at two chosen stacks of tiles in secret before the game starts. For the rest of the game you cannot communicate.)&#10;&#10;-description from publisher&#10;&#10;"

The 3 clues are shuffled to form a &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; (for example: cross-skull-hourglass). The pattern will be revealed as you play the game and flip the clues face up.

The game is played with six-sided tiles, each edge having either one, two, three or four pips.&#10;&#10;Usually a 2-4 player game, Hexinos can be played by five player (six is unwieldly and its too long between turns).&#10;&#10;All players start each turn with two tiles (hidden from the other players). On their turn the player places one of those two tiles onto the game table, matching at least one edge of their six sided tile to a tile edge already on the game table. That placement is immediately scored (see below), the player retrieves another tile from the facedown tilepile and then the player to their left takes their turn. Play continues until all tiles have been placed.&#10;&#10;There are two ways of scoring Hexinos tile placement: Basic and Advanced. Basic can be used with younger kids or just to make the game play go a bit faster.&#10;&#10;Basic scoring is super basic - if the player matches:&#10;&#10;+  one edge of their tile to one edge of a tile already on the game table: score one point&#10;&#10;+ two edges of their tile: score three points&#10;&#10;+  three edges of their tile: score six points&#10;&#10;+ four edges of their tile: score ten points&#10;&#10;+  five edges of their tile: score fifteen points&#10;&#10;+ all edges of their tile - the &quot;perfect match&quot;: that player wins immediately.&#10;&#10;Advanced scoring requires both addition and multiplication:&#10;&#10;+  one edge of their tile to one edge of a tile already on the game table: score one point for each pip on that matching edge of the player's tile (e.g. if the matching tile edge has three pips, its three points (not six))&#10;&#10;+ two edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by two&#10;&#10;+  three edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by three&#10;&#10;+ four edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by four&#10;&#10;+  five edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by five&#10;&#10;For both Basic and Advanced scoring - if the placed tile closes off an empty tile space (called &quot;bridging&quot;), the placing player scores as usual for the edges that match, then a bonus of six points for each empty hex that has been closed off.&#10;&#10;A note about younger players:&#10;As long as the player can hold and place the tiles, Hexinos can be played at any age. For younger players it encourages both pattern matching and spatial recognition - seeing their tile with an edge with 2 pips next to a 3 pip edge, but does that match what is on the tiles already on the table, or is the 2 &amp; 3 &quot;backwards&quot;? And with the basic scoring system, kids easily grasp the benefit of &quot;more edges matching is better&quot; without needed to know addition or multiplication.&#10;&#10;-description from designer&#10;&#10;"

New map and counters, all done by Charles Kibler. It simulates the abortive attempt on 30 and 31 October 1813 by the Austro-Bavarians under de Wrede to prevent Napoleon's escape from Germany after the defeat at Leipzig, by blocking him near Frankfurt.&#10;&#10;The game uses the now robust latest version of the rules, which employs roster sheets and oblong counters to simulate formation changes between line and column. The battle is fought at regimental level at a scale of 250m per hex, and in 30-minute game turns. Losses are recorded on roster sheets, and the rules, in english (the French version will be available on the Pratzen website), are of medium complexity.&#10;&#10;This new edition also includes the second day battle set up and units, when de Wrede tried to attack the French after the Emperor left.&#10;&#10;Game System:&#10;scale = 250 m/hex;&#10;time = 30 min/GT;&#10;strength = 300 men/SP (Regimental Size).&#10;&#10;"

This line separates the two sides, white against blue.&#10;The goal of the game is to obtain the largest number possible of consecutive signs or of a same symbol. The principle is to put down a pair of cards of same sign in order to be allowed to place a third card on his side of the Zodiac. &#10;It is permitted to place a sign on the line only if it is different from the ones which are already on its side. If the opponent has already placed a card there, then a battle is engaged to determine which player will keep that sign.&#10;For the battle, both players secretly choose a die among their available dice. The dice are thrown and the winner is the player obtaining the highest score. The used dice are then put away.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

In Permute, two players take it in turns to twist 2x2 sets of pieces on the board, attempting to 'solve' together connected groups of their pieces.  The player who builds the bigger solved group wins the game &ndash; but at any time, the opponent can step in and twist your groups apart again!&#10;&#10;How to play:&#10;&#10;Permute is played on a square board filled with orange and yellow playing pieces in an alternating checkerboard pattern.  Orange always plays first.  Players take it in turns to select a 2x2 area of the board, called a &lsquo;face&rsquo;, and twist the pieces within that area 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, as if rotating the face of a 2x2 Rubik&rsquo;s Cube.  After twisting, the active player must flip over or &lsquo;bandage&rsquo; one of her pieces in that face; bandaged pieces may not be part of any more twisting moves for the remainder of the game.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, the accumulating bandaged pieces eventually make any further twists impossible; at that point, the game is over.  Players then count up their largest connected ('solved') group of pieces of their colour; pieces only count as connected when they are horizontally or vertically adjacent.  The player with the largest solved group of pieces wins the game.  If the players are tied for the largest group, then the second-largest groups of each player are compared to determine the winner; if those are also tied, then the third-largest groups are compared; and so on.&#10;&#10;Permute is a scalable game and can be played on any board size. &#10; Playing on a 12x12 board is recommended for casual play, and a 16x16 board for deeper strategic contests.  A typical game on a 12x12 board will last 40-50 turns; a 16x16 game will last 70-80 turns.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"
