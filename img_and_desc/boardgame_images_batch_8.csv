Each planet is contested by two players, either (or both) of whom can add cards representing, for example, settlers, energy modules, terraforming, or mining to their side.  A given planet may provide mineral resources and a number of settlement points -- the minerals can be collected for victory points, and if the planet is sufficiently terraformed, the settlement points go to whichever player sent the most settlers.&#10;&#10;"

Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.&#10;&#10;The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.  The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.&#10;&#10;It is a commercial version of the traditional playing card game President (based on the Chinese game Zheng Shang Yu), which has also been reimagined as:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dilbert: Corporate Shuffle&#10;    Pyramid Card &#10;    Scum: The Food Chain Game &#10;    Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;"

It is released in 3 distinct modules, or units. 1825 Unit 1 and 1825 Unit 2 broadly cover the same area as the 1829 southern board. 1825 Unit 3 covers most of the remainder of England and Scotland, and with unit 2 will cover the same area as the 1829 northern board. Along with the units are a number of expansion kits, which introduce extra money, trains, tiles, companies, and phases. There are currently three, and will be four regional kits, which cover areas of England, Scotland and Wales not included in the three base units.&#10;&#10;The rules are largely 1829 with improvements. Survey parties are now optional, and track is built in much the same way as most other 18xx titles. The stock market is largely the same, but multiple leaps up the market are allowed if dividends are high enough. Trains can now run to, but not through tokened out stations, and company shares become available in &quot;bands&quot; of the same value. All shares in each band become available when one of the companies in the previous band is sold out.&#10;&#10;Play time varies enormously, depending on how much of the game you play. A single unit on its own will last 1 1/2 to 3 hours, and accommodate 2-4 or so players. Multiple units and expansions add to both the number of players and the playing time. Two units and all the expansions should accommodate 3-6 players (7 max. officially) and last for anything from 4 to 8 hours. All three units will work for 4-9 players, and a fair amount longer.&#10;&#10;"

With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.&#10;&#10;Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP).

If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;"

Each player then takes it in turn to roll the number dice and move their train along the allotted spaces, they must then give an answer from the category they land on using the last letter from the previous players answer as the starting letter of their answer...and so on.&#10;&#10;For example&#10;The game is in full flow and it's your turn, the player to your right has left you on an 'E' by saying Bruce leE (they were on the actor/actress square).

You only have 60 seconds to say the name of a group or singer whose name begins with an 'E'.&#10;&#10;Who do you say...the sands of time are slipping away...if you don't say a name soon you will lose one of your passengers, there's only a few seconds left...what about Elvis presleY.

TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.&#10;&#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.&#10;&#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.&#10;&#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.&#10;&#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.&#10;&#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;"

The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.&#10;&#10;Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.&#10;&#10;For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.&#10;&#10;Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.&#10;&#10;For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations. He reached the finals but, in a victory for human intuition over number crunching, lost the championship game by a touchdown and a field goal.&#10;&#10;"

On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent does have more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).&#10;&#10;"

Players are trying to get their pawns from their starting position around the board into the safe zone. If a pawn is either landed on or passed over by another player's pawn, the jumped pawn is returned to its starting location. However, players don't simply roll the dice and move in Zap Zerapp. Instead, two dice are rolled and results are announced to the table. Players simultaneously start picking up one of the thirteen little wooden containers and shaking them. Inside the containers are one to thirteen lead pellets. Players are trying to select the container with the highest number of pellets, so long as it doesn't exceed the result of the dice. Once all players have selected their container (the number of pellets are denoted on a sticker on the bottom), players move one-by-one from highest to lowest, assuming their selection allows them to move at all by being lower.&#10;&#10;"

Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.&#10;&#10;Each player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are &quot;required play&quot; (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).&#10;&#10;The full version contains 56 tiles.&#10;&#10;Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG.

In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where the shot hits, which combines with his/her weapon to determine the damage inflicted. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.&#10;&#10;Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.  Indian raids, barroom brawls and poker games are just a few of the hypothetical situations.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Component List(From box back, augmented with detail from Wayne's Books page)&#10;&#10;&#10;     Rules&#10;     8x two-sided mapboards&#10;     Result card deck (108)&#10;     Pad of personal history sheets&#10;     Countersheet&#10;         60 round (people)&#10;         112 medium square (objects)&#10;         96 small square (tactical)&#10;         9 large (horses)&#10;    &#10;     Action Cards (130)&#10;         7x standard sets of 12 each&#10;         4x B1&#10;         7x B2&#10;         7x B3&#10;         5x B4&#10;         5x B5&#10;         5x B6&#10;         5x B7&#10;         4x B8&#10;         4x B9&#10;    &#10;     &quot;Second Floor&quot; player-aid cards x4&#10;&#10;&#10;"

More points are gained if these are also in the same circle.&#10; How the game is played:  &#10; This player will throw the dice 5 times in order to place all the dice on the board.&#10;1.The player throws one die of each color along with the special die.&#10;2.The player checks the special die in order to see what possibilities are open to him for changing the outcome of his throw and improving the position. The value of the numbers of the dice does not affect the result.&#10;&#10;Explanation of the symbols of the special die:&#10;The side which has two dice drawn on it permits the player to change the number on 1 or 2 of the the 3 dice thrown to match the number showing one of the other die.&#10;&#10;The side which has one die drawn on it permits the player to change the number of one of the dice thrown to match the number on one of the other two dice thrown.&#10;&#10;The symbol of the 2 half circles with arrow heads allows the user to interchange the position of two dice already placed by him on the board with a view to ending up with a group of dice with the same numbers and, even better, of the same color as well.&#10;&#10;The symbol of the 3 small squares with a divided arrow coming from middle one allows the player to change the number on a die which has already been placed on the board or which the player is about to place on the board, to any other number.&#10;&#10;The Flying Turtle is the super bonus. It allows the player to do all the moves which are permitted by the other symbols on the special die.  Further more, when placed in the center of the board it increases the players points considerably.&#10;&#10;&#10;3. Once the player's throw has been adjusted to take into account the special die, the player places his dice in the zone or zones of his choice.  He will in so doing try to fill the empty spaces in a circle with dice with the same numbers and if possible, of the same color.&#10;&#10;End of the game:&#10;The player who has the highest score after 5 turns wins.&#10;&#10;"

1050,,"extrapolated from English rules:&#10;&#10;A co-operative game for two to six players twelve years old or more.&#10;&#10;Contents&#10;&#10;A board in two parts&#10;Two colored wooden pieces (Momo and the tortoise Kassiopeia)&#10;12 colored wooden discs (the hour flowers)&#10;84 hexagonal cards and 4 spare cards&#10;    - top side : dream pictures or question marks&#10;    - under side: green or grey&#10;&#10;One day the children notice that people have less and less time.  Momo finds out that spooky 'grey men'  are tempting people to bring them their time to save it in a time savings bank.  In fact they are stealing their time.  The more time they save, the colder, sadder, more hurried and poor their existence becomes.&#10;&#10;Finally, with the help of a wonder flower and Master Hora's advice, Momo and Kassiopeia the tortoise, try to beat the grey men and give the people back their time.&#10;&#10;&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia must find the way to Master Hora and meet each other at the gate to the never-alley. But how?  Momo has a dream.  She sees a picture that shows the way.  Kassiopeia also has a dream.  It is as if she goes along a dream street and after a long time meets Momo at the gate to the never-alley.&#10;&#10;First, the players split into two groups.&#10;One group takes the yellow Momo figure, all the cards with the yellow edges, and one half of the board.&#10;The other group takes the brown Kassiopeia figure, all the cards with brown edges, and the other half of the board.&#10;IMPORTANT:&#10;The two groups don't play against each other but with one another.  Each group respects the other and doesn&rsquo;t make things too difficult or too easy.&#10;&#10;The start of the game&#10;&#10;The two groups sit apart from each other so that they cannot see the other half of the board, preferably on two separate tables.&#10;&#10;Each group sorts their cards.  The green cards and the grey cards are separated. At first, only the green cards are used, as well as the Gigi and Beppo cards.&#10;&#10;Each Group now lays a selected card, with a dream picture showing,  on a space on the board.  But not on one of the three approaches to the never-alley.  This card is the start square.  Momo and Kassiopeia are placed here on their respective boards.&#10;&#10;For the first game, the path should not be more than ten cards long.  See the illustration.&#10;&#10;The storytelling begins&#10;&#10;In turn, each group tells the other a story, involving the dream pictures on the chosen path.  For each question mark on the path, the group thinks up their own imaginary picture.&#10;The other group listens carefully and tries to remember the story.&#10;&#10;After the two stories have been told, the grey cards are placed on the empty squares of the board (colored pictures face up). The whole board is now full of dream pictures and question marks, and the original path is no longer clear.&#10;&#10;The two groups come together and put the two halves of the board together.  Each group now positions itself by the other half of the board and will soon move the figure which goes with that half.&#10;&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia run through the city&#10;&#10;At last Momo and Kassiopeia set off.  Each group moves their figure in turn onto an adjacent space.  It is important that all the players should participate by recalling the story they heard and they should all agree which space the figure should move to.&#10;Before either Momo or Kassiopeia is placed on a new card, the card is turned over.  If the underside is green the card remains turned and the figure steps onto it.  But if it is grey, the world, once again, becomes a little colder, and an hour flower is taken to the time-store of the grey men.  Master Hora's flower is left until last.&#10;Momo and Kassiopeia may not step on the grey cards.&#10;&#10;Gigi and Beppo help Momo and Kassiopeia.  If a group finds one of the friends, this group may expose any chosen card.  In this case, no flower need be given up if the chosen card is grey.&#10;&#10;When Momo or Kassiopeia reach the gate to the never-alley,  they wait there for each other and go together to Master Hora.  Master Hora gives them his flower and so Momo and Kassiopeia free all the captured flowers.  The flowers are given back to the people.  Together you have won the game.  If Master Hora has to give up his flower to the grey men no more can be done.  Momo and Kassiopeia, together, have lost the game.&#10;&#10;"

All players simultaneously play onto either stack, with the only limitation being that the card played must be one greater or one less than the face up card.  Players race to go out - and receive a random number of points for doing so.&#10;&#10;"
