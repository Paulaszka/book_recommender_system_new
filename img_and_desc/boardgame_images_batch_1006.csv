It features a larger board, 21 major companies, and more offboard areas than either 18EA/62 or 18WE/72.  Any player familiar with 18WE/72 will very easily be able to enjoy 18EE/82, because the rules are almost completely identical aside from setup.&#10;&#10;18EE/82 features five regions instead of three, in which only three of four corporations are typically startable, as well as 3 minor companies in Hungary.  The four non-Hungarian regions feature randomly selected subsidies at setup, out of a pool of five.  These simple differences in setup present the players with major strategic decisions in what railroads to found, as well as how their companies will best be developed and operated.&#10;&#10;18EE/82 has extremely high replayability, due to its random setup at the beginning of the game.  Every non shell company is assigned a license type randomly (from expresses, freights, and regionals).&#10;&#10;18EE/82 has a larger board than 18WE/72, covering much of Eastern Europe.  The map also has more offboard areas, including the premier zones of Berlin and Constantinople.  Like in 18WE/72, there is no plain yellow track.  All track tiles are unlimited. Each company gets at least three track actions to determine tile placements and upgrades.  The map size supports more stations which can be acquired during the life of each corporation.  Each corporation may lay TWO additional tokens each operating round, instead of just one.&#10;&#10;The financial aspects of 18EA/62 you will find almost fully intact. There are parliament rounds, mergers, and refinancing, all as players know them from its predecessor game. Similarly both chartered and non-chartered corporations function in exactly the same ways.  This allows players to focus on the operational aspects of the game, without having to learn a new financial framework if they are familiar with either game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square board. The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 10x10 squares.&#10;&#10;Both players must have access to a sufficient number of disks of their own color and a sufficient number of neutral blocks.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;DefinitionsA stack is a disk lying directly on the board along with all other disks piled onto it on the same square.&#10;&#10;The height of a stack is the number of disks in it.&#10;&#10;A group is a stack along with all other like-colored stacks one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent stacks of its color.&#10;&#10;Similarly, a patch is a square not occupied by a block along with all other such squares one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent squares not occupied by blocks. Note a patch may contain any number of groups, as well as empty squares.&#10;&#10;The size of a group or patch is the number of squares it spans.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;PlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, make exactly one of these board plays:&#10;&#10;- Place a disk of your color on an empty square.&#10;&#10;- Move a stack of your color any number of squares in a straight orthogonal line, without jumping over any blocks or enemy stacks, to a square occupied by an enemy stack of the same height. Then, remove this enemy stack, add a disk to your stack on that square and place a block on the square from which you just moved your stack. Note a stack can jump over friendly stacks.&#10;&#10;If you have no board plays available on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.&#10;&#10;The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, for each patch on the board, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from it until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over in a patch owns the patch. Empty patches are owned by neither player.&#10;&#10;The player with the higher score in the resulting position wins. Your score is the sum of the sizes of the patches that you own. If there is a tie, whoever made the last board play loses.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Pie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair.

English King, John, was also involved with a growing conflict with the French, who were steadily taking lands along the border with Normandy. Indeed, John had only recently assumed the thrown following the death of his older brother, Richard (the Lionhearted) during a siege to retake one of the castles the French had captured earlier while the English king was on crusade.

Lee. General Joseph Hooker, newly appointed by President Lincoln, was in command of the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln&rsquo;s engagement letter ended with the words &quot;Give Us Victories&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;The game begins on April 30, 1863, with the Army of the Potomac now beyond the Rappahannock and Rapidan, marching toward Chancellorsville.

Your opponent does the same; then mix and pull&hellip;! Formations may move, attack, entrench, bombard and so on. Special rules cover the use of skirmishers, trench building, and bridge building. Players perform actions alternately with a random activation system always engaging and different, creating chaos and uncertainty, in a realistic and tense simulation.&#10;&#10;Four games included&#10;&#10;    Main game - 2 standard maps, 2 counter sets (figure and Nato style, so players can choose), medium difficulty, 6-8 hours for the campaign, 4 scenarios, 2 variations.&#10;    Strategic game - 1 A3 map, 1 counters set, 1 hour of gameplay, low difficulty.&#10;    Solo game - AI simulates Army of the Potomac, 1 counters set; uses the same maps of the main game.&#10;    Skirmish game - set of paper toy soldiers, landscape elements and counters; low difficulty, playing time 30 minutes.&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Each double-sided market indicates how many face-up and face-down cards are placed there, in addition to the special power of that market.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, players bid to see who selects goods first from a market, with the bidding rules being set by the back of the topmost goods card in the deck. Whoever wins the bid pays their money to the bank, while everyone else keeps their coins. (Coins are victory points, so you might not want to throw away too many of them!)&#10;&#10;The winning bidder chooses a market, uses the power of that market (if they wish), then takes all of the goods from that market, flips them face up (if needed), then loads the goods on their camels. A camel can hold goods of only one type, and if a goods type is on a camel, then you must continue placing that good on the same camel. Each camel has a goods limit, however, and if you exceed that limit, then you must throw away all of that type of good.&#10;&#10;Each other player in clockwise order then chooses an unchosen market, optionally uses its power, and collects and loads its goods. Each player then has the option of selling goods from at most one camel, with each type of goods paying out in different ways:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Dates: Cards show 1-4 dates, and the more you sell at once, the more money you receive.&#10;    Carpets: Cards come in six colors, and you can't sell the same color twice in a batch. Again, the more you sell at once, the better.&#10;    Vases: Cards come in three types (with some overlap), and you can sell only one shape at a time&#10;    Fruit: Cards come in four types worth different amounts, and you can sell only the lowest-valued fruit.&#10;&#10;&#10;Place a 1 coin on the unchosen market, flip all the other markets, refill those markets with cards, then start the next round. When the deck runs out, complete one more round &mdash; selling once from each of your camels &mdash; then whoever has the most money wins.&#10;&#10;"

Choose your recipes wisely to clear your workbench and stick others with too much raw material because the first player to overflow their nemesis' cauldron with enough ingredients wins!&#10;&#10;In Whirling Witchcraft, you start with a hand of four recipe cards, as well as a number of ingredients on your workbench; ingredients come in five types, and you have a limited number of spaces for each type on your workbench.&#10;&#10;Everyone plays simultaneously during each round. You all choose and reveal a recipe from your hand at the same time, then you can use as many recipes in play in front of you as you wish to convert and transform ingredients. Maybe you'll turn a mushroom into the harder-to-find mandrake, then you can turn two mandrakes (using an older one and the one you just created) to make three mushrooms. You can use each recipe at most once a round, and when you're finished, place all of the final ingredients into a cauldron, then pass it to your neighbor on the right. They must then fit all of these ingredients on their workbench &mdash; and if they can't, they must return the &quot;extra&quot; ingredients to you for placement in your &quot;Witch's Circle&quot;.&#10;&#10;If you now have at least five ingredients in your Witch's Circle, the game ends and you win; otherwise you all pass your recipe cards in hand to the player on your left, refill your hand to four cards, then start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game includes personality cards you can use to give each player a unique power, in addition to a different set of starting ingredients. Some recipes can be played in either of two directions to help you customize how you transform ingredients, and recipes might also have arcana symbols that give you bonus powers when you collect enough of them.&#10;&#10;Can you put together the right cookbook to land your neighbor in hot water?&#10;&#10;"

The person to the left of the dealer leads out by playing one card of any color and play goes clockwise with each player playing one card per turn.  Players must &ldquo;follow suit&rdquo; by playing a card of the same color that was led out.  If they are out of the color that was led, they can play any color including the trump color.  The player that wins the trick takes the cards played (they are set aside to indicate a trick won) and then leads out for the next round of play.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to score the highest number of points. If a player's bid is made exactly (not under or over) add amount bid plus 5 points. If bid is not made, subtract amount bid or the number of tricks taken &ndash; whichever is the greater number. This game is easy to play, but becomes very difficult to accurately predict the number of tricks that will actually be taken.  The game ends with a special round where each player is dealt one card and each player shows every other player their card by putting it on their forehead (without looking at it).  Bids are made and the cards are laid on the table to see who takes the trick.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

During their journey the people of Israel meet many difficulties, which can affect their morale. The task of Moses (the player) is to keep their morale high enough, otherwise traveling will stop. God is with Israel in the pillars of cloud and fire. God helps his people to reach the destination by giving manna from Heaven and water from the rock. Sometimes stubborn people stir up the wrath of God and they have to sacrifice sin offerings in order to reconcile their deeds and get blessings. God rewards the obedience of people by letting them carry the Ark of the Covenant. The winner is the one who reaches the goal and offers first a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving.&#10;&#10;The players will advance in pre-determined path in the game by throwing a dice and will have to keep their moral points above 2 by getting maximum of one for free or paying three/five silver coins. The players can also bog each other down by bribing the enemy causing the other to pay to progress or get slowed down. Leading the race after Mount of Sinai is also important, the leader will have the Ark of the Covenant giving him the choice to make additional step.&#10;&#10;"
