Sir Agravain and Sir Mordred gathered twelve knights and stormed Guinevere&rsquo;s chamber, finding Lancelot there with the Queen.

You are among the desperate few in search of those lost treasures.&#10;&#10;SteamPunk Arena is a turn-based strategy game with an objective to explore the islands looking for salvage, exploit the resources you find there, expand your domain using bridge networks,  and exterminate your opponent.

These heroes will help spur theatre-specific units on by providing an action modifying bonus.&#10;&#10;The combatants begin the conflict with the same garrisoned unit strength and an equal amount of land; however, this is where your similarities will end. Where you place your Base Tile or Land Tiles is entirely up to you. What lies hidden and waiting to be discovered could also provide a unique advantage or disadvantage.  But keep in mind no matter what your path looks like, the dice-roll will often decide the outcome of events that transpire throughout the playthrough.&#10;&#10;Using a turn-based unit action system. The combatant controls the action of active units throughout the duration of the turn until all action points are spent. The health of the unit is determined by a population or hit-point, found in the center of the piece. Units can only be deployed one per turn. There are only so many population points you can have active on the arena game boards at any given time, unless modified by a certain Resource or Unit Bonus. So choose your army wisely and enjoy the fight. We will see you out in the Arena!&#10;&#10;"

It&rsquo;s an inter-dimensional mystery!&#10;&#10;It plays exactly like Clue with a few additional rules and slight changes. First off, you use two dice to get around the board because of the way the board is shaped. Second, none of the character models are possible murderers in the game, instead they have been replaced by six random characters from the series on cardboard tokens. Third, there&rsquo;s an added Contraption Card pile that you can get by landing on a &ldquo;?&rdquo; spot. Lastly, all of the characters have a Personality Card that gives them an added ability in the game like the ability to travel to a different part of the board without rolling dice, or getting the chance to see the same card someone just revealed to someone else.&#10;&#10;Contraption cards will do things such as adding an extra six to your dice, taking an extra turn, or asking a bonus question.&#10;&#10;"
