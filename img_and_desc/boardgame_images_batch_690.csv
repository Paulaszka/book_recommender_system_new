Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.&#10;&#10;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...&#10;&#10;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs &mdash; unless, of course, it is averted! The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of victory points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not. Whichever Path manages to collect most points will be the new seat for the Capital, thus the most important force left on the planet...&#10;&#10;"

The Game begins shortly after Charles IV of France dies in 1328. The Queen of England, Isabella of France, is unable to claim the French throne for herself, and has claimed it for her son, Edward III. France rejects the claim, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess.

As the Commander of English Forces, you must control a significant number of French Cities and Towns before the last Campaign Card is played.&#10;&#10;GAME OBJECTIVE: Player takes command of the English Forces. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 10 French Cities and 12 French Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played. If the French control London and Portsmouth at the end of their Turn, the French win. If the last Campaign Card was played and Player does not control 10 Cities and 12 Towns, France Wins.&#10;&#10;GAME FEATURES: NO KING OF ENGLAND features lots of colorful game counters of various Combat Units including Nobles, Knights, Archers, Handgunners and Cannon.

In most cases, they are paid with influence points, which vary from faction to faction depending on their main focus. If a player can not muster enough points for an action, then he can trade with his fellow players. Or he activates a district, which lets him perform the action or pulls a card that allows him to perform the action or uses a person of his faction. Or he changes a paragraph, so that the action costs less points.&#10;&#10;The player who collects the most victory-points will win the game after five rounds. The way you collect victory points depends on the one hand on your ideology, which you choose at the beginning of the game. So every player gains victory points in different ways. For example, one player gets a victory point every time he prevents other players actions. Another player collects victory points if the other players give him voluntarily cards or influence points. On the other hand players can gain victory points on certain districts, by cards and paragraphs.&#10;&#10;At the end the player will be victorious, who is both the most accurate follower of his ideology, as has also been successful in competitive areas.&#10;&#10;"
