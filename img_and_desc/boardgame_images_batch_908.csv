The first team to take all 9 lives of their traitor wins the game!&#10;&#10;But these families are bringing in the big guns. We're talking drone strikes, holy hand grenades, rocket launchers, sticky bombs, napalm strikes, explosive arrows, and more!&#10;&#10;Each turn, you will draft 5 cards, program them out in front of you (choosing the top or bottom action of each card), then watch the chaos unfold. After each turn, projectiles move (either due to gravity or due to their momentum) and airborne cats fall toward the ground.&#10;&#10;Just remember, no plan survives contact with the enemy. Your carefully placed grenade might be run into by your own teammate. Your sprint could be negated as you're pushed off the ceiling fan. Your enemy could slap you so hard you spin around and start attacking your own team!&#10;&#10;Rocket Cats was born out of our love for old-school, 2-dimensional, side-scrolling artillery games like Worms Armageddon and Scorched Earth. We wanted to take the fun, chaotic excitement from these games and transform it into a boardgame. A game where you know things probably won&rsquo;t end up exactly as you planned&hellip; which is half the fun!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

As the U.S. commander, you maneuver your task forces and conduct air searches in a tension-packed contest to find the Japanese carriers before they locate and attack yours.  Simple game mechanics control Japanese movement and determine the timing and strengths of their attacks. You will not know that a Japanese air strike is headed your way until it is detected by radar and you scramble your fighters to intercept.&#10;&#10;The game has a total of nine scenarios.   Four learning scenarios take you through the rules by programmed instruction using slices of the real battle.  The other five are full-scale, fully replayable games.  These include one-day scenarios for each day of the action, a two-day scenario for the whole battle, a hypothetical scenario presuming different US plans, and a hypothetical scenario in which Midway was never fought and the Japanese come armed with the full Pearl Harbor striking force.&#10;&#10;Carrier Battle: Philippine Sea is based on Carrier: The Southwest Pacific Campaign &#226;&#128;&#147; 1942-1943 (Victory Games, 1990) but is a new, standalone wargame.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;&#10;"

Waddles has been banned from the bus system and had to stay behind in Piedmont, Stan and Ford are both off on their own adventures in parts unknown and Wendy got a new job outside of town! Tourism is way down and business is not good at the Mystery Shack so far either. Soos has been nice enough to let Dipper and Mabel stay in the Mystery Shack attic again as his guests, but what's the point? It starts to seem like the twins aren't going to re-live another 'amazing summer' after all... that is until Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, and Gideon pay a surprise visit to the twins. They tell the twins tales of new strange things going on in town and how the four of them have been out adventuring every day and are now on a quest to get to the bottom of all this new weirdness. For Mabel and Dipper, nothing sounds better than a Quest for the Ultimate Summer Adventure in Gravity Falls!&#10;&#10;Players assume the role of one or more of the Gravity Falls characters: Dipper, Mabel, Candy, Grenda, Pacifica, or Gideon. Each character has unique abilities and each can be &quot;leveled-up&quot; to further expand their uniqueness. Players take turns moving their character(s) on the game board, which is a representation of the Gravity Falls townsite and surrounding area. On each board space a player may choose to stop and perform an action, such as visiting local shops to purchase equipment, supplies, or items to use as weapons, or they may &quot;Search&quot; their current location. Searching requires players to draw a card from the Search Deck, which contains random events, Foes, and item cards.&#10;&#10;Encounters with enemies (Foes) requires that characters first make a &quot;Fear Test&quot;, pitting their own &quot;Weirdness&quot; against their newly-encountered Foe. The game also employs a &quot;Fear Tracker&quot; which has increasing threat levels indicating how frightened the characters are at the moment. When the Fear level is low, creatures like a Gremgoblin or Giant Fruit Bat may not seem so scary at all. But, as the Fear level increases, it is possible that even encountering cute critters like Fairies, Beavers or a Snake-Badger (or is it a Snadger?) may be terrifying causing characters to initially flee before they are willing to re-consider engaging in battle.&#10;&#10;Games may be played using a fully randomized game board and Search deck, or players may use the Quest book that is included with the rules to play through a story-driven series of increasingly difficult Quests to discover what is behind these strange goings-on in Gravity Falls. For each of these Quests that are completed the players may draw a single Treasure card, which is often a rare or unique item that they can keep or trade in to the Mystery Shack in exchange for in-game bonuses or perks.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;"

November 1989. Under pressure from the civil rights movement, the GDR leadership has to retreat. The dictatorship is in an overt crisis, from which it will not recover. This affects the Ministry for State Security as well. On November 6th, a few days before the Wall came down, Minister Erich Mielke orders the destruction of documents.&#10;&#10;For the card game Stasi: Over and Out players change their usual perspective and work for the Stasi. The goal of the game is to destroy as many documents as possible. Every destroyed document earns points. At the end, the player with the most points wins the game. Civil rights activists will try to stop the players. The game ends when five or more citzen cards are revealed. Players have to choose between distracting the citizens or destroying more documents. Like during the original events in 1989/90, the Stasi will lose the game to the citizens.&#10;&#10;Players take turns. Every turn they have to draw and reveal three cards from a draw pile. These cards represents documents of different values (0 - +4), citizens of differnet values (-1 - -4), and special actions, representing historical artifacts, events and a way to break the games symmetry. Players can then play two actions, two different ones or the same one twice: Destroy one document, distract one citizen, take one special action. Destroyed documents are placed face down in front of the players, citizens that were distracted come back face-down underneath the draw pile, special actions are discarded and maybe shuffled back in the draw pile later.&#10;&#10;The rules of the game are explained during the course of the game. Cards with rules text are sorted into the draw pile. Players learn the rules as the game proceeds. Cards are numbered, so the order of the cards can be restored. In addition to this there are cards, that explain the historical background. There is no booklet. The game starts the moment the box is being opened.&#10;&#10;Stasi: Over and Out was developed by Playing History, a company that is specialized in creating games with historical background, games that are educational. This game was designed to be played not only in educational environments, but also at home, by smaller play groups and by people who are not used to learn game rules and play games.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;"

One player is the nightmare, and the others are Mito. Each player is dealt a certain number of image cards and one clue card. Such as 'number', 'color', etc. is written in clue cards. If you have 'number' clue card, you may only ask about numbers, such as &quot;is the reality related to six?&quot;&#10;&#10;When you try to make a pair, you try to find another player who has the identical image of reality (namely, who has the identical card as one of yours). First, you ask everyone else what the reality is related, complying with your clue card. Other players say &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. Then you target a player who said &quot;Yes&quot;. Both you and that player place the card which they think is identical with each other face-down.&#10;&#10;In a later turn, you may reveal the two cards. If these are identical, Mito's side takes the pair which can count toward victory. Otherwise the nightmare takes these two cards.&#10;&#10;Mito's side wins when they successfully make three pairs of cards with different symbols. The nightmare wins when they have taken three pairs of cards with different symbols or six cards with the same symbol, or when the image deck runs out.&#10;&#10;As the nightmare, you should try to misdirect Mito's side indicating that you have the right image, even if you don't have.
