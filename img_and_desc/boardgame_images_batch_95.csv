Animals turn out along the circular mountain trail, and a photographer needs to be ahead of the other if he wants to take a good picture: it is important to have a clear view, i.e. not blocked by anyone. Each subject is represented on a tile, and it is worth a certain amount of points, i.e. &quot;cameras&quot;, in this game. At the end of the round, the players exchange the decks so they will both have the same chance of playing, then new subjects are drawn, and a new round starts.

Yet, there are those veterans, men of honor and war, who have the taste of freedom and blood fresh on their tongues. Perhaps your call to them to follow you yet again into battle would give you the strength needed to claim control over the city.

The other eight dice (2 large and 6 small) are simultaneously rolled in full view of all the players, and must not be touched by ANY player.&#10;&#10;The two Large Dice form a 2-digit number, which can either be high or low. For example, if the large dice show a 3 &amp; 6, the low number would be 36 and the high number would be 63. Players study the dice and quickly call &quot;HIGH&quot;, &quot;LOW&quot;, &quot;HIGH/LOW&quot; or &quot;ZIPPY&quot; AFTER they have found a way of totaling either of the two numbers formed by the large green dcie with the small black ones using addition, subtration, multiplication and division.&#10;&#10;The first person to call and get a correct result gets 1 chip, unless they call HIGH/LOW and show both answers - then they get 2 chips. You lose the same amount of chips if you are incorrect. If you call ZIPPY (which means no possible way to reach the target values) you get a chip from the bank unless someone challenges you. Then, whomever is correct pays the other.&#10;&#10;The advanced version uses the 4-9 die in place of one of the other large dice for more challenging possible results.&#10;&#10;UK players will see this as a dice driven version of the numbers quiz from the TV show Countdown.&#10;&#10;"

Boom Box can be played by 2 or more players at the same time: each player just needs the supplied deck of 27 cards (print and cut them); the faster the player gets rid of his cards, the better! The cards represent different notes in three different colours and different lengths. After each player has flipped over the first card from their decks (this card representing the Boom Box itself), they must play their cards to the left or right of the radio, respecting these two easy rules: if you want to place a card on the Boom Box left channel, this card does not have to have any characteristic in common - number of notes, colour, length - with the preceding one; on the other hand, if you want to place a card on the Boom Box right channel, it must have at least one thing in common with the previous one. It is easy, isn't it? But what if the goal is to have the same number of cards on the left and on the right? Things get interesting and slightly harder, but funnier as well! Challenge your friends in this fast competition, and you will see! As soon as cards are placed, players draw new ones from their decks: when a deck is emptied, the round is over and points are scored.
