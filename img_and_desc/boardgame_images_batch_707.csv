Every round is completely random, immature, inappropriate, and sometimes shame inducing.&#10;&#10;How do you play?&#10;&#10;It's easy. The player up draws Subject cards and everyone else has to guess whether that person likes or dislikes each card. The person with the most correct guesses wins, and draws a CoolCat card. The person with the least correct guesses loses, and draws an AssHat card. If there's a tie, a Tiebreaker card is drawn to determine the winner or loser. All you have to do is grab a drink, grab some friends, and enjoy.&#10;&#10;"

An albatross circles the shipwreck that lies broken on the shore. The sun is setting and a warm light starts to shine from inside the gaping ship; it&rsquo;s the Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove inn.&#10;&#10;Four Captains sit at a round table at the center of the inn; some of the other guests are staring at the brightly coloured clothes they are wearing. A parrot closely watches the whole scene from a chandelier above the table. The colourful captains don&rsquo;t seem to mind; they talk, rest, laugh and enjoy their beers.&#10;&#10;Suddenly a small boy runs in, holding a sealed letter for the innkeeper. After reading the letter, the innkeeper glances at the other guests before walking over to the four captains. In a low whisper he says &ldquo;Friends, my contact from the Republic tells me that the price of pepper has just surpassed the price of gold&rdquo;, and turns back to his bar.&#10;&#10;The mood changes as a storm on a summer day and the captains reach for their weapons as if struck by lightning. Cautiously, they slowly stand up and back off from the table, but as their greed gets the better of them, they start running to their brightly coloured ships&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;Players start the game on smuggler's cove as one of these brightly coloured captains. Each captain owns a small ship with a tiny crew, one cannon and an empty cargo hold. Over the course of the game, each captain gathers resources to upgrade their ship at the shipyards of the Orient and the Republic or trades its cargo for valuable pepper in the Orient to get shares in the Trading Company and ensure their victory.&#10;&#10;The amount of sails determines how far you move per turn. Crew is used for boarding other ships and plundering cargo. Cannons deal damage to other ships and the size of your cargo hold determines how much cargo you can load and carry.&#10;&#10;Each player holds a hidden hand of cards from his own deck that can be used as temporary buffs to sail further, carry more cargo, or change the tide of battle.&#10;&#10;Besides all this players can hire the notorious pirate at Smugglers Cove, to secretly ambush other captains.&#10;&#10;&#10;CotGA has 0% randomness, all skill. Its main mechanics are pick-up and deliver combined with hand-management and bluff. Players choose the length of the game by the size of their starter ships.&#10;&#10;Trade cargo to upgrade your sails, crew, cannons or cargo holds. Attack other captains and board their ships to plunder cargo. Hire the notorious pirate to ambush competitors. Whatever your strategy, always keep one eye on the captain with pepper in his cargo hold.&#10;&#10;"

In each round, players take turns placing workers to gather letter tiles, action cards, and a die. The letter tiles are used to construct words on the players' tableaus. The action cards provide a variety of actions. For example, some cards are &quot;resource cards&quot; that provide an alternative way to collect resources. Other cards provide the ability to manipulate letters. Other cards provide victory points and other special powers. The die chosen has two functions: (1) to move player's pawns along a track whose spaces provide more abilities and (2) to activate some of the action cards.&#10;&#10;"

However, there is very little moisture left, so The Queen will implement a new plan.&#10;&#10;In her travels, The Queen has accumulated a collection of out-of-commission mining robots. She has reprogrammed them all into Robotanists and will use them to turn metal and rare gems into an elaborate garden. The Robotanist AI isn't the best, but they'll try as hard as they can to please their Queen. She doesn't quite remember exactly what the gardens look like, but she'll know it when she sees it. Until then, the Robotanists will work the mines, build the garden, and place gems as they all vie to be the Queen's favorite.&#10;&#10;The Last Garden is a worker placement and betting game for 2-4 players. Each player controls a number of Robotanists as they seek to create a beautiful garden out of scraps and gems. On every turn, a player places a Robotanist onto the board and plays a card that shifts the structures in the garden or manipulates gems. At the end of a set number of days, the player who has gained the most favor wins.&#10;&#10;"

Players take turns drawing as many cards as they want from the deck, scoring a range of 1-5 Baby Points for each card drawn. There is no limit to the amount of times a player can draw cards, but as soon as she draws a Monster Parent, she loses all her cards in her Baby Zone and is forced to end the turn.&#10;&#10;But wait, it is not as easy as it sounds. First of all, cards drawn are secretive and only known to the player drawing them. Players can guess at the total Baby Points of each other by the number of cards they drew, but not the exact Baby Points acquired. A player with 8 cards might only have an actual total of 9 Baby Points while a player who drew 5 cards could already be sitting on 10 Baby Points! This is where players try to match the amount of cards by drawing at least as many cards or more than their opponents in order to ensure their victory.&#10;&#10;Play special abilities, sabotage other players' turns and store items to help you pave your way to the top of the Hill.&#10;&#10;"

Your duty is to build a higher tower than everyone else.&#10;&#10;Each card has one of rock-paper-scissors symbol. You can easily increase the height of your tower by placing a card from your hand onto your pile of cards, so that your card can defeat the top card of that pile.&#10;&#10;But if you have built your tower too much higher than your opponents, the God gets angry and destroys your tower.&#10;&#10;You can also raise opponents' towers in the same manner, so you should watch every tower and keep your tower at moderate height, though this game proceeds in real time so fast that you don't have enough time to watch closely.&#10;&#10;When the players have exhausted the decks, the round ends and players compare towers by counting the cards stacked in each. In a three-player game, there is a fourth dummy tower as well. The tallest tower wins, unless it is three or more cards higher than the next highest tower. If it is too high, it's eliminated (tying towers likewise). Then compare the next highest tower to see if it is too high and so on.

But, drink too much and the demons will take a liking to you, and you won't be allowed to leave!&#10;&#10;If you don&rsquo;t want a drink that&rsquo;s made its way to your hand, you can also force the other players to take drink cards. Keep a close eye on your banquet buddies to make sure you don&rsquo;t end up with too many drinks! Know your limit and drink just the right amount.&#10;&#10;Those who drink too much drop out of the game, but those who don&rsquo;t drink enough won&rsquo;t please the demons, so balance is

Crews can vary in size, typically from four to six, and the character and crew creation systems allow for practically any concept to be built. Detailed environmental rules that include options for flora, fauna, gravity, dangerous terrain and atmosphere, and scenario design rules that ensure that missions are varied and demand adaptation and cunning on the parts of the combatants, make practically any encounter possible. Run contraband tech to rebel fighters on an ocean world while being hunted by an alien kill-team or hunt down a research vessel and fight zero-gravity boarding actions in the cold depths of space--whatever you can imagine, you can do.&#10;&#10;"

The primary focus of the game is on soldiers and NCOs in light &quot;flank&quot; companies, as they scout ahead of larger forces and take part in man-to-man actions against enemy skirmishers.&#10;&#10;Although the game allows for the formation of accurately sized companies of light infantry and cavalry if you wish, these formations are broken down into small groups of up to a dozen men. For the most part, officers are not swashbuckling super-heroes, but staunch commanders who rally and direct their men to achieve the battlefield objectives. Although the games uses an alternating action turn sequence, officers can use their influence to multiple units at the same time in an effort to steal the initiative. With all rolls resolved using standard 6-sided dice, this game combines a classic wargaming feel with modern wargame mechanics.&#10;&#10;"

Pendragon &ndash; The Fall of Roman Britain covers a century of history from the first large-scale raids of Irish, Pict, and Saxon raiders, to the establishment of successor kingdoms, both Celtic and Germanic. This sumptuous volume adapts the celebrated asymmetrical COIN engine to depict the political, military, religious, and economic struggles of Dark Ages Britain.&#10;&#10;Pendragon leverages the tremendous flexibility of the COIN system, from dual events to dissimilar approaches and victory conditions, to capture the complexity of the period and let the players explore alternative narratives. Unlike earlier volumes, Pendragon is not about counterinsurgency per se, but focuses on the asymmetrical clashes between and among Romano-British authorities and Barbarian powers gnashing over the carcass of the Roman Empire, including:&#10;&#10;Barbarian Raiders plundering the land and trying to surprise unwary towns and hillforts, then melting into hills or fens. Expansion or decline of the Saxon Shore naval defense system to counter sea-borne raiders. Authentic Late-Roman military doctrine&mdash;mighty but hard-to-replace cavalry tracking down raiding parties before they can return their booty home. Accessible, powerful but fickle Foederati: barbarian warbands in Briton employ. Nuanced battle system representing troop qualities and tactics. Fortified strongholds that must be assaulted, besieged, or rebuilt to gain regional political control. Civil wars, coups, religious shifts, and cultural assimilation. Population movements over the generations, due to good administration, barbarian ravages, or climatic changes. Epochal Events ranging from Roman usurpations on the continent to massive reprisals against barbarian homelands. Evolution of rules and victory conditions throughout the game, as the still vivacious Roman Empire may or may not end with Britain fragmented among competing semi-barbarian proto-kingdoms. A deck of 83 cards with gorgeous commissioned original art. Short, medium, and full-length scenarios Support for solitaire, 2-player, 3-player and 4-player experiences.&#10;&#10;Each faction in Pendragon brings specific capabilities and challenges:&#10;&#10;The Dux represent the original Roman Army in Britannia: with the most powerful units in the game and a network of strong fortresses ringing the island and tied by efficient roads, you must strive to preserve the stability and prosperity of the provinces and punish any interloper daring to challenge the peace. If you can build up your prestige and maintain order, you may be able to keep the island in the Empire, or at least united in a new post-Roman power. You can rely on the civilian militia to assist you, but&mdash;as your peerless cavalry dwindles&mdash;you must resort to the traditional Roman offer to barbarians of land for service in your forces as Foederati. As the decay of institutions conspires with the scheming of feckless civilians and the marauding of restless barbarians, you may find that the dream of Empire is dead. If so, with your once proud Army little more than another group of warlords, you still can strive to carve for yourself the most powerful kingdom alongside your new rivals.&#10;&#10;The Civitates represent the Romanized aristocracy ruling the ancient Celtic tribes from lavish villas and prosperous Roman towns, chafing under the distant authority (and taxes) of Rome, mistrusting the uncultured and semi-Barbarian army, and yearning to settle century-old accounts with their neighbors. When the Barbarian storm comes down upon your island, you may find yourself woefully unprepared to cope&mdash;materially or culturally&mdash;and presented with a fundamental choice: strive to protect your lands, wealth, and way of life via the despised Army and untrustworthy Foederati, or sacrifice Roman comforts to face down the Barbarian challenge militarily and culturally through a return to Celtic traditions.&#10;&#10;The Saxons represent various Germanic groups including Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Franks who harried, settled, and eventually took over swaths of Britain. As outsiders, you face a steep challenge just to come ashore against the might of the Roman army and navy. You will chip away at the Saxon Shore system, ravage the provincial economy to weaken the Britons&rsquo; capability to wage war, and see  some of your best warriors serve as Foederati (often against yourself), but recognize  that the more Saxons living on the island&mdash;whoever their paymaster&mdash;the more opportunities for advancing your nation. Eventually, you must secure footholds, perhaps in the marshy fens of the eastern seaboard that so resemble your homelands, in order to wield your considerable military potential and challenge the old masters of these rich lands to create England.&#10;&#10;The Scotti, named for the marauding groups of Irish raiders, also represent those Celts native to the island of Britain who differed from the romanized Civitates by remaining true (or reverting back) to the old ways. Often, the boundary between the two groups was porous... The biggest such group eventually formed the northern nation of the Picts, forebears of modern Scotland. As the Scotti, you see the disintegration of Roman Britain as an opportunity not so much to expand as to seize riches and renown to assert yourself at home. Raid ceaselessly, surprise and plunder poorly protected communities, kidnap for ransom, and show your military prowess against your unfortunate neighbors across the Irish Sea and Forth-Clyde isthmus&hellip; Then establish bases strategically along the enemy shores and entreat local hill tribes to reject post-Roman authority. But beware that your very advances will help give rise and limit your ability to grapple new powerhouses on the island!&#10;&#10;Components: See Wiki below.&#10;Players: 1-4 (includes full solitaire system)&#10;Map: Area Movement&#10;Timescale: about 15 years per campaign between Epoch cards&#10;Designer: Marc Gouyon-Rety&#10;Developer and Series Creator: Volko Ruhnke&#10;&#10;"
